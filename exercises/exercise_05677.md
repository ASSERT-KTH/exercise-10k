## Exercise
Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs whether it is a perfect square or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)
    return sqrt == int(sqrt)

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if is_perfect_square(num):
        print(f"{num} is a perfect square.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not a perfect square.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 16 is a perfect square.
