## Exercise
Create a program that takes in basic arithmetic expressions (e.g., 2+2, 5*5) and outputs the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_expression(expression):
    """
    Evaluate a basic arithmetic expression.

    Args:
        expression (str): The arithmetic expression to evaluate.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the evaluated expression.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the expression is invalid or contains unsupported operations.
    """
    try:
        result = eval(expression)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Invalid expression: {expression}. Error: {str(e)}")


def main():
    # Example usage
    expressions = ["2+2", "5*5", "10/2", "7-3"]
    for expression in expressions:
        try:
            result = evaluate_expression(expression)
            print(f"{expression} = {result}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(str(e))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
2+2 = 4
5*5 = 25
10/2 = 5.0
7-3 = 4
```
