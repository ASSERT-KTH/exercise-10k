## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the product of all the elements in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def product_of_array(arr):
    """
    This function calculates the product of all elements in a given array.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The product of all elements in the array.
    """
    product = 1
    for num in arr:
        product *= num
    return product

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Product of array elements:", product_of_array(arr))
```

## Generated Output
