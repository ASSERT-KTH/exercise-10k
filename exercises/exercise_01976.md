## Exercise
Create a function that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. The function should take a list as an argument and return the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(numbers):
    """
    This function implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.
    
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of numbers.
    """

    # Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying it in-place
    numbers_copy = numbers.copy()
    
    # Get the length of the list to use in our loop
    n = len(numbers_copy)
    
    # We need to repeat the process of comparing and swapping adjacent elements for n-1 passes
    for i in range(n-1):
        
        # In each pass, we compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            
            # If the current element is greater than the next one, swap them
            if numbers_copy[j] > numbers_copy[j+1]:
                
                # Swap the elements by using a temporary variable
                temp = numbers_copy[j]
                numbers_copy[j] = numbers_copy[j+1]
                numbers_copy[j+1] = temp
                
    # After the loop finishes, the list is sorted, so we return it
    return numbers_copy

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", bubble_sort(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
