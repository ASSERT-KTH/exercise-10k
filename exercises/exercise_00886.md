## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their income and prints out the amount of tax they owe based on the following rates: 10% (income below 10000), 15% (income between 10000 and 20000), 20% (income above 20000).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculates the tax owed based on the income.

    Args:
        income (float): The user's income.

    Returns:
        float: The amount of tax owed.
    """
    if income < 10000:
        tax_rate = 0.10
    elif income < 20000:
        tax_rate = 0.15
    else:
        tax_rate = 0.20

    tax_owed = income * tax_rate
    return tax_owed

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_owed = calculate_tax(income)
    print(f"Your tax owed is: ${tax_owed:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $Your tax owed is: $2250.00
```
