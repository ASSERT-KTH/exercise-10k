## Exercise
You are given a dictionary where the keys are the names of students and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects. Create a function that calculates the average grade for each student and then finds the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, return all of them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_highest_average_grade(students):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in the given dictionary and returns the student(s) with the highest average grade.

    Args:
        students (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the names of students and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects.

    Returns:
        list: A list of students with the highest average grade.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grade for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the given dictionary
    for student, grades in students.items():
        # For each student, calculate the sum of their grades
        total_grade = sum(grades.values())
        
        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of subjects
        average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
        
        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade

    # If the students dictionary is empty, return an empty list
    if not average_grades:
        return []

    # Find the maximum average grade
    max_average_grade = max(average_grades.values())
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the students with the highest average grade
    highest_average_students = []
    
    # Iterate over each student in the average_grades dictionary
    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():
        # If the student's average grade is equal to the maximum average grade, add them to the highest_average_students list
        if average_grade == max_average_grade:
            highest_average_students.append(student)

    # Return the list of students with the highest average grade
    return highest_average_students

# Example usage:
students = {
    'Alice': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},
    'Bob': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85},
    'Charlie': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 90}
}

print(find_highest_average_grade(students))
```

## Generated Output
```
['Charlie']
```
