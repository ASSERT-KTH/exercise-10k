## Exercise
Write a program to find the sum of all even numbers in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(num_list):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.
    """
    even_sum = sum(num for num in num_list if num % 2 == 0)
    return even_sum


def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    print("Input List:", numbers)
    print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even_numbers(numbers))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Input List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Sum of even numbers: 30
