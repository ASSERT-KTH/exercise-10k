## Exercise
Create a program that manages a bank account using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.account_name = account_name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposit successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            if amount <= self.balance:
                self.balance -= amount
                print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
            else:
                print("Insufficient funds for withdrawal.")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account_number = input("Enter your account number: ")
    account_name = input("Enter your account name: ")
    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_name)

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Management Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your account number: Enter your account name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd4f0og9g.py", line 58, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpd4f0og9g.py", line 30, in main
    account_name = input("Enter your account name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
