        amount_paid (float): The amount paid.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the change in dollars and cents.
    """
    change = round(amount_paid - price, 2)
    dollars = int(change)
    cents = int((change - dollars) * 100)

    return dollars, cents

def main():
    # Get the price of the item and the amount paid from the user
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: $"))
    amount_paid = float(input("Enter the amount paid: $"))

    # Calculate the change
    dollars, cents = calculate_change(price, amount_paid)

    # Print the change
    print(f"Change: ${dollars}.{str(cents).zfill(2)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
