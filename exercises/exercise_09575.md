## Exercise
Create a program that defines two functions: one to calculate the area of a rectangle and another to calculate its perimeter. Both functions should take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments. The program should then ask the user for the length and width, call the functions with these values, and print out the calculated area and perimeter.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def rectangle_perimeter(length, width):
    perimeter = (length + width) * 2
    return perimeter

length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

area = rectangle_area(length, width)
perimeter = rectangle_perimeter(length, width)

print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwcp20lfp.py", line 9, in <module>
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Enter the length of the rectangle: 5'
```
