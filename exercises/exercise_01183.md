## Exercise
Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. Use conditional statements to determine the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer"""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock") or \
         (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): ")
        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()
        if user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
        if play_again.lower() != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): 
You chose: Rock
Computer chose: Rock

It's a tie!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpynoonqee.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpynoonqee.py", line 31, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
