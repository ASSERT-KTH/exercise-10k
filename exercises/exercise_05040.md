## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects using for loops.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the subjects and their respective scores
subjects = ["Maths", "Science", "English", "History", "Geography"]
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

# Define the grade thresholds
grade_thresholds = {
    "A": (90, 100),
    "B": (80, 89),
    "C": (70, 79),
    "D": (60, 69),
    "F": (0, 59)
}

# Function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    for grade, threshold in grade_thresholds.items():
        if threshold[0] <= score <= threshold[1]:
            return grade

# Calculate the grade for each subject
for i in range(len(subjects)):
    subject = subjects[i]
    score = scores[i]
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Subject: {subject}, Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

# Calculate the overall grade
total_score = sum(scores)
average_score = total_score / len(scores)
overall_grade = calculate_grade(average_score)
print(f"Overall Average Score: {average_score:.2f}, Overall Grade: {overall_grade}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Subject: Maths, Score: 85, Grade: B
Subject: Science, Score: 90, Grade: A
Subject: English, Score: 78, Grade: C
Subject: History, Score: 92, Grade: A
Subject: Geography, Score: 88, Grade: B
Overall Average Score: 86.60, Overall Grade: B
```
