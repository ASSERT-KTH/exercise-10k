## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is a user-inputted number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Problem Description: Calculate the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to n

# Importing Modules
import math

# Defining Functions
def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum_squares += i ** 2
    return sum_squares

# Main Program
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to {} is: {}".format(n, sum_of_squares(n)))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to 5 is: 55
```
