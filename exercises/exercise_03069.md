## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the discount for a given price and discount percentage. The program should print out the discounted price.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discounted_price(price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discounted price given the original price and discount percentage.

    Args:
        price (float): The original price.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The discounted price.
    """
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * price

    # Calculate the discounted price
    discounted_price = price - discount_amount

    return discounted_price


def main():
    # Get the price and discount percentage from the user
    price = float(input("Enter the price: $"))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage (%): "))

    # Calculate the discounted price
    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(price, discount_percentage)

    # Print the discounted price
    print(f"The discounted price is: ${discounted_price:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the price: $
