## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its square, with a docstring that describes the function's behavior

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_number(num):
    """
    This function takes a number as an argument and returns its square.

    Args:
        num (int or float): The number to be squared.

    Returns:
        int or float: The square of the input number.
    """
    # First, we check if the input is a number
    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a number")

    # Now, we calculate the square of the number using the exponentiation operator (**)
    # The exponentiation operator (**), when used with a power of 2, calculates the square of a number
    square = num ** 2

    # Finally, we return the calculated square
    return square
```
