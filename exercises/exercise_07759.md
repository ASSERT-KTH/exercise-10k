## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The program should handle cases where the input score is not within the range of 0 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
        return "D"
    elif score >= 0 and score <= 59:
        return "F"
    else:
        return "Bad score"

# Test the function
print(calculate_grade(100))  # Expected output: A
print(calculate_grade(89))   # Expected output: B
print(calculate_grade(79))   # Expected output: C
print(calculate_grade(69))   # Expected output: D
print(calculate_grade(59))   # Expected output: F
print(calculate_grade(101))  # Expected output: Bad score
```

## Generated Output
```
A
B
C
D
F
Bad score
```
