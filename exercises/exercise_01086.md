## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs the first number raised to the power of the second number.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, p;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    cout << "Enter the power to which the number should be raised: ";
    cin >> p;
    cout << num << " raised to the power of " << p << " is " << num * num << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```python
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double num, p;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    cout << "Enter the power to which the number should be raised: ";
    cin >> p;
    cout << num << " raised to the power of " << p << " is " << pow(num, p) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
