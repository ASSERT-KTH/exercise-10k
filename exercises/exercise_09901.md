## Exercise
Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def binary_search(numbers, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a sorted list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A sorted list of numbers.
        target (int): The target number to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target number if found, or -1 if not found.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(numbers) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if numbers[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif numbers[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1

def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    target = 5

    result = binary_search(numbers, target)

    if result != -1:
        print(f"Target number {target} found at index {result}.")
    else:
        print(f"Target number {target} not found in the list.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Target number 5 found at index 4.
```
