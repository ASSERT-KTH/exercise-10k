## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial principal amount.
        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal).
        years (int): The number of years.

    Returns:
        float: The final amount after compound interest.
    """
    final_amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** years
    return final_amount

def main():
    # Get user input
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    # Calculate compound interest
    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The final amount after {years} years is: ${final_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"The compound interest earned is: ${final_amount - principal:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppyk360gm.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmppyk360gm.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'principal amount = 1000, interest rate = 5, number of years = 10'
