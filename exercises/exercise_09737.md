## Exercise
Write a program that takes the initial position, final position, and time as input and returns the distance traveled.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_distance(initial_position, final_position, time):
    """
    Calculate the distance traveled.

    Args:
    - initial_position (float): The initial position.
    - final_position (float): The final position.
    - time (float): The time taken.

    Returns:
    - distance (float): The distance traveled.
    - average_velocity (float): The average velocity.
    """
    distance = abs(final_position - initial_position)
    average_velocity = distance / time

    return distance, average_velocity

def main():
    # Get user input
    initial_position = float(input("Enter the initial position (in meters): "))
    final_position = float(input("Enter the final position (in meters): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time (in seconds): "))

    # Calculate distance and average velocity
    distance, average_velocity = calculate_distance(initial_position, final_position, time)

    # Print results
    print(f"Distance traveled: {distance} meters")
    print(f"Average velocity: {average_velocity} meters per second")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the initial position (in meters): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpv488x8tj.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpv488x8tj.py", line 21, in main
    initial_position = float(input("Enter the initial position (in meters): "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '0 10 2'
```
