## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(greeting):
    """
    Returns a closure function that takes a name as an argument.

    Args:
        greeting (str): The greeting to use in the returned function.

    Returns:
        function: A function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting.
    """

    def inner_function(name):
        """
        Prints a greeting message.

        Args:
            name (str): The name to include in the greeting.
        """
        print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

    return inner_function


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a closure function with a greeting
    hello = outer_function("Hello")
    hi = outer_function("Hi")

    # Use the closure functions
    hello("Alice")
    hi("Bob")
```
