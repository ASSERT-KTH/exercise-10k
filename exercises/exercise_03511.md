## Exercise
Write a program that checks the type of a variable and prints its type.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_variable_type(var):
    """
    Checks the type of a variable and prints its type.

    Args:
        var (any): The variable to check.
    """
    var_type = type(var)
    print(f"The type of the variable is: {var_type.__name__}")


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test with different variable types
    variables = [
        10,  # int
        10.5,  # float
        "Hello",  # str
        True,  # bool
        [1, 2, 3],  # list
        {"a": 1, "b": 2},  # dict
        (1, 2, 3),  # tuple
        {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}  # set
    ]

    for var in variables:
        check_variable_type(var)
```

## Generated Output
```
The type of the variable is: int
The type of the variable is: float
The type of the variable is: str
The type of the variable is: bool
The type of the variable is: list
The type of the variable is: dict
The type of the variable is: tuple
The type of the variable is: set
