## Exercise
Find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search in.
    t (str): The string to search for.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    t_count = Counter(t)
    required = len(t_count)

    left = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    min_str = ""

    formed = 0
    window_counts = {}

    for right in range(len(s)):
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed += 1

        while left <= right and formed == required:
            character = s[left]

            if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                min_len = right - left + 1
                min_str = s[left:right + 1]

            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed -= 1

            left += 1

    return min_str

# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
