## Exercise
Write a function to create a dictionary from a list of keys and a list of values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def create_dict(keys, values):
    """
    This function creates a dictionary from two lists, one for keys and one for values.
    
    Args:
        keys (list): A list of keys for the dictionary.
        values (list): A list of values for the dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary created from the given keys and values.
    """
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs
    result = {}
    
    # We use the zip function to iterate over the keys and values in parallel
    # The zip function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted, 
    # so we don't have to worry about lists of different lengths
    for key, value in zip(keys, values):
        
        # For each pair of key and value, we add them to the dictionary
        result[key] = value
    
    # Finally, we return the resulting dictionary
    return result

# Example usage:
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
print(create_dict(keys, values))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
