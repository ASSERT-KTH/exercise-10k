## Exercise
Implement the selection sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The program should take a list of integers as input and output the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original list:", arr)
print("Sorted list:", selection_sort(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
