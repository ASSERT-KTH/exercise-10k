## Exercise
Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order. The function should not modify the original array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    """
    This function takes an array of integers as input, creates a copy of it, 
    and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new list with the elements in reverse order.
    """
    
    # First, we want to make sure that the input is a list. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")
    
    # We use list slicing to create a copy of the input list. This is done to avoid modifying the original list.
    # The syntax arr[:] means "create a new list that includes all elements from arr".
    new_arr = arr[:]
    
    # Now, we use the built-in list method 'reverse()' to reverse the order of the elements in the new list.
    # This method reverses the list in-place, meaning it modifies the list directly.
    new_arr.reverse()
    
    # Finally, we return the new list with the elements in reverse order.
    return new_arr

# Alternatively, you can use list slicing to achieve the same result in a more concise way:
def reverse_array_concise(arr):
    """
    This function takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new list with the elements in reverse order.
    """
    
    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")
    
    # We use list slicing to create a new list that includes all elements from the input list, but in reverse order.
    # The syntax arr[::-1] means "create a new list that includes all elements from arr, but in reverse order".
    return arr[::-1]
