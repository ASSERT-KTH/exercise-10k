## Exercise
Write a function that takes in a dictionary containing student information, where each key is a student ID and each value is another dictionary containing the student's name, age, and grades. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student IDs as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(student_info):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.

    Args:
        student_info (dict): A dictionary containing student information.
            Each key is a student ID and each value is another dictionary containing the student's name, age, and grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the student IDs as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student ID in the student_info dictionary
    for student_id, info in student_info.items():
        # Check if the 'grades' key exists in the student's info dictionary
        if 'grades' in info:
            # Calculate the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades
            # We assume that the grades are stored in a list or other iterable
            average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])
        else:
            # If the 'grades' key does not exist, set the average grade to None
            average_grade = None

        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student_id] = average_grade

    # Return the average_grades dictionary
    return average_grades
```
