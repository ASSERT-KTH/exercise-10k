## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name, age, and favorite color as input, validates that the age is a positive integer, and then prints out a formatted greeting message including the user's name, age, and favorite color. If the age is not a positive integer, print an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to print a greeting message
def print_greeting(name, age, color):
    greeting = "Hello, my name is {0} and I am {1} years old. My favorite color is {2}.".format(name, age, color)
    print(greeting)

# Define a function to get the user's details
def get_details():
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    color = input("Please enter your favorite color: ")

    # Try to convert the age to an integer
    try:
        age = int(age)
        if age <= 0:
            print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
            return get_details()  # Recursive call if age is not positive
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
        return get_details()  # Recursive call if age is not an integer

    # Call the print_greeting function with the user's details
    print_greeting(name, age, color)

# Call the get_details function to start the program
get_details()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Please enter your favorite color: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 25 years old. My favorite color is Blue.
```
