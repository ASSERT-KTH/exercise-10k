## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a conversation with the user. The user inputs their messages, and the program responds accordingly.

## Reference Solution
```python
# conversation_simulator.py

# Define a dictionary to store user inputs and corresponding responses
responses = {
    "hello": "Hi, how are you?",
    "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
    "what's your name": "My name is Conversational AI",
    "goodbye": "See you later, have a great day!",
    "default": "I didn't quite understand that, could you please rephrase?"
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """Return a response based on the user's input"""
    user_input = user_input.lower()
    for key in responses:
        if key in user_input:
            return responses[key]
    return responses["default"]

def main():
    print("Welcome to the conversation simulator!")
    print("Type 'goodbye' to exit the conversation.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "goodbye":
            print("AI: ", get_response(user_input))
            break
        print("AI: ", get_response(user_input))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the conversation simulator!
Type 'goodbye' to exit the conversation.
You: AI:  Hi, how are you?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzu2j5ge0.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpzu2j5ge0.py", line 25, in main
    user_input = input("You: ")
