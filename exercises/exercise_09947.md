## Exercise
Create a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. The program should ask for user input, and then print out whether the number is even or odd.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_even_odd(num):
    """Check if a number is even or odd."""
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return "even"
    else:
        return "odd"

def main():
    # Ask for user input
    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number. Please try again.")

    # Check if the number is even or odd
    result = check_even_odd(num)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The number {num} is {result}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a number: The number 10 is even.
```
