## Exercise
Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the longest common prefix between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_prefix(str1, str2):
    """
    Returns the longest common prefix between two strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first input string.
        str2 (str): The second input string.

    Returns:
        str: The longest common prefix between str1 and str2.
    """
    prefix = ""
    for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2):
        if char1 == char2:
            prefix += char1
        else:
            break
    return prefix

def main():
    # Example usage:
    str1 = "hello world"
    str2 = "hello python"
    print("Longest common prefix:", longest_common_prefix(str1, str2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Longest common prefix: hello
```
