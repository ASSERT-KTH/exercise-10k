## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.
    
    Returns:
        list: The Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for _ in range(2, n):
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

def main():
    # Example usage
    n = 10
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to the {n}th number:")
    print(fibonacci(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
