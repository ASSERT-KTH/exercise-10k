## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. The function should take the amount of change and the denominations of the coins as arguments and return the minimum number of coins.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(change, denominations):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change.

    Args:
        change (int): The amount of change to be made.
        denominations (list): A list of coin denominations.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of coins needed to make the change. If it's impossible to make the change, return -1.
    """

    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to change
    # We initialize all values to infinity except for the first one, which is 0 (we need 0 coins to make 0 change)
    min_coins_needed = [float('inf')] * (change + 1)
    min_coins_needed[0] = 0

    # For each coin denomination
    for denomination in denominations:
        # For each amount from the coin denomination to the total change
        for amount in range(denomination, change + 1):
            # The minimum number of coins needed for the current amount is the minimum of the current value and
            # the minimum number of coins needed for the amount minus the coin denomination plus 1
            min_coins_needed[amount] = min(min_coins_needed[amount], min_coins_needed[amount - denomination] + 1)

    # If the minimum number of coins needed for the total change is still infinity, it means it's impossible to make the change
    # So we return -1
    # Otherwise, we return the minimum number of coins needed
    return -1 if min_coins_needed[change] == float('inf') else min_coins_needed[change]
```
