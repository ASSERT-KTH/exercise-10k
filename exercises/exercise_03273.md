## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to print out the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence
a, b = 0, 1

# Print the first term
print(a)

# Print the remaining terms using a for loop
for i in range(9):
    # Print the current term
    print(b)
    
    # Calculate the next term
    a, b = b, a + b
```

## Generated Output
```
0
1
1
2
