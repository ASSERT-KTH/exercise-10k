## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate the concept of variable closure.

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    Outer function that returns an inner function with access to its variables.
    
    Args:
        outer_variable: The variable from the outer scope.
    
    Returns:
        A function with access to the outer_variable.
    """
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        """
        Inner function that has access to the outer_variable and its own local variables.
        
        Args:
            inner_variable: A variable from the inner scope.
        
        Returns:
            A string demonstrating variable closure.
        """
        return f"Outer variable: {outer_variable}, Inner variable: {inner_variable}"
    
    return inner_function

def main():
    # Create an outer function with a variable
    outer_var = "Hello"
    inner_func = outer_function(outer_var)
    
    # Call the inner function with its own variable
    inner_var = "World"
    result = inner_func(inner_var)
    
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World
```
