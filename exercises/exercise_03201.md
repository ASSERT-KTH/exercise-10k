## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
    
    Parameters:
    num1 (int): The first number
    num2 (int): The second number
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of num1 and num2
    """
    return num1 + num2

def main():
    # Take two numbers as input from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the sum
    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)
    print("The sum of the two numbers is: ", sum_of_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcfnnrslk.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcfnnrslk.py", line 16, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
