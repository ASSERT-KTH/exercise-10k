## Exercise
Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

## Reference Solution
```python
def swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):
    """
    Swap the values of two variables using arithmetic operations.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first variable.
        b (int): The second variable.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.
    """
    a = a + b  # Store the sum of a and b in a
    b = a - b  # Store the difference between the sum and b in b (which is the original value of a)
    a = a - b  # Store the difference between the sum and the new b in a (which is the original value of b)
    return a, b

# Example usage
a = 5
b = 10
print("Before swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
a, b = swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b)
print("After swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
```

```python
def swap_variables_xor(a, b):
    """
    Swap the values of two variables using bitwise XOR.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first variable.
        b (int): The second variable.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.
    """
    a = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of a and b in a
    b = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of the new a and b in b (which is the original value of a)
    a = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of the new a and the new b in a (which is the original value of b)
    return a, b

# Example usage
a = 5
b = 10
print("Before swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
a, b = swap_variables_xor(a, b)
print("After swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
```

```python
def swap_variables_tuple(a, b):
    """
    Swap the values of two variables using tuple packing and unpacking.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first variable.
        b (int): The second variable.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.
    """
    return b, a

# Example usage
a = 5
b = 10
print("Before swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
a, b = swap_variables_tuple(a, b)
print("After swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
```

## Generated Output
```
Before swap: a = 5 , b = 10
After swap: a = 10 , b = 5
```
