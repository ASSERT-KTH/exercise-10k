## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary of student grades as input and calculates the average grade for each student. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should then print out the student names and their corresponding average grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Modules
import statistics

# Defining a Function
def student_average(grades):
    for name, grade_list in grades.items():
        average = statistics.mean(grade_list)
        print(f"Student: {name}, Average Grade: {average}")

# Main Program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    grades = {
        "Alice": [90, 85, 95],
        "Bob": [80, 75, 90],
        "Charlie": [70, 65, 80],
    }

    print("Average Grades:")
    student_average(grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
Average Grades:
Student: Alice, Average Grade: 90
Student: Bob, Average Grade: 81.66666666666667
Student: Charlie, Average Grade: 71.66666666666667
```
