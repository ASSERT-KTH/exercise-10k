## Exercise
Write a program to divide two numbers and display the quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number to be divided.
        divisor (int): The number to divide by.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder

def main():
    # Get user input
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    # Check for division by zero
    if divisor == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        # Calculate and display the quotient and remainder
        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpud4u67im.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpud4u67im.py", line 18, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
