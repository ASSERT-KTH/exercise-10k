## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements, and returns the modified list. The function should also remove any duplicate elements from the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_and_remove_duplicates(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers, reverses the order of the elements, 
    and returns the modified list while removing any duplicate elements.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with reversed order and no duplicates.
    """

    # First, we'll convert the list to a set to remove any duplicate elements.
    # Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements.
    unique_set = set(input_list)
    
    # Then, we'll convert the set back to a list so we can reverse the order.
    # We use the list() function to convert the set to a list.
    unique_list = list(unique_set)
    
    # Now, we'll reverse the order of the elements in the list.
    # We use slicing with a step of -1 to reverse the list.
    reversed_list = unique_list[::-1]
    
    # Finally, we return the modified list.
    return reversed_list

# Example usage:
print(reverse_and_remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]))
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
