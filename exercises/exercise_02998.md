## Exercise
Write a program that finds the maximum product of two numbers in a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_product(numbers):
    """
    Find the maximum product of two numbers in a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum product of two numbers.
    """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must contain at least two numbers.")

    # Sort the list in descending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)

    # Calculate the product of the two largest numbers
    max_product_1 = numbers[0] * numbers[1]

    # If the list contains negative numbers, calculate the product of the two smallest numbers
    if numbers[-1] < 0 and numbers[-2] < 0:
        max_product_2 = numbers[-1] * numbers[-2]
        return max(max_product_1, max_product_2)
    else:
        return max_product_1


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [10, 20, 30, -40, -50]
    print(max_product(numbers))
```
