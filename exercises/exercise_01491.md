## Exercise
Write a program that demonstrates the use of set operations in programming.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Print the sets
print("Set 1:", set1)
print("Set 2:", set2)

# Union operation (combines all elements from both sets)
print("\nUnion:")
print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1 | set2)

# Intersection operation (returns elements common to both sets)
print("\nIntersection:")
print(set1.intersection(set2))
print(set1 & set2)

# Difference operation (returns elements in set1 but not in set2)
print("\nDifference (set1 - set2):")
print(set1.difference(set2))
print(set1 - set2)

# Difference operation (returns elements in set2 but not in set1)
print("\nDifference (set2 - set1):")
print(set2.difference(set1))
print(set2 - set1)

# Symmetric difference operation (returns elements in either set, but not both)
print("\nSymmetric Difference:")
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
print(set1 ^ set2)

# Subset operation (checks if all elements of set1 are in set2)
print("\nSubset (set1 is subset of set2):")
print(set1.issubset(set2))

# Superset operation (checks if all elements of set2 are in set1)
print("\nSuperset (set1 is superset of set2):")
print(set1.issuperset(set2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Set 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Union:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Intersection:
{4, 5}
{4, 5}

Difference (set1 - set2):
{1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3}

Difference (set2 - set1):
{8, 6, 7}
{8, 6, 7}

Symmetric Difference:
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Subset (set1 is subset of set2):
False

Superset (set1 is superset of set2):
False
