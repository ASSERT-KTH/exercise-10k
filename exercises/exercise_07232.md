## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to find all prime numbers up to a given number (n) provided by the user. The program should print out each prime number as it is found.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_primes(n):
    """Finds all prime numbers up to n."""
    num = 2
    while num <= n:
        is_prime = True
        divisor = 2
        while divisor * divisor <= num:
            if num % divisor == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
            divisor += 1
        if is_prime:
            print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
        num += 1

def main():
    """Gets the input from the user and starts the prime number search."""
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    find_primes(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 2 is a prime number.
3 is a prime number.
5 is a prime number.
7 is a prime number.
```
