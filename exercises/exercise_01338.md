## Exercise
Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns the Levenshtein distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def levenshtein_distance(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

    Args:
        s1 (str): The first string.
        s2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2.
    """
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Initialize the base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Fill in the rest of the table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            cost = 0 if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1] else 1
            dp[i][j] = min(
                dp[i - 1][j] + 1,      # Deletion
                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,      # Insertion
                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost  # Substitution or no operation
            )

    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = "kitten"
    s2 = "sitting"
    print(f"Levenshtein distance between '{s1}' and '{s2}': {levenshtein_distance(s1, s2)}")
```
