## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to get two numbers from the user and print their sum
def print_sum():
    # Get the first number from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

    # Get the second number from the user
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the sum of the two numbers
    print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", num1 + num2)

# Call the function
print_sum()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpw7gdoh6c.py", line 13, in <module>
    print_sum()
  File "/tmp/tmpw7gdoh6c.py", line 4, in print_sum
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 3'
```
