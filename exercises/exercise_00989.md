## Exercise
Write a program that displays the weather forecast based on the user's input. The program should use if-else statements to determine the forecast based on the temperature and humidity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def display_weather_forecast():
    # Get user input for temperature and humidity
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    humidity = float(input("Enter the humidity percentage: "))

    # Determine the weather forecast based on temperature and humidity
    if temperature < 0:
        forecast = "It's freezing!"
    elif temperature < 15:
        forecast = "It's cold."
    elif temperature < 25:
        forecast = "It's mild."
    else:
        forecast = "It's hot."

    # Add humidity to the forecast
    if humidity < 40:
        forecast += " And it's dry."
    elif humidity < 70:
        forecast += " And the humidity is moderate."
    else:
        forecast += " And it's humid."

    # Display the weather forecast
    print(f"The weather forecast is: {forecast}")

# Call the function to display the weather forecast
display_weather_forecast()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd0t9d_4x.py", line 28, in <module>
    display_weather_forecast()
  File "/tmp/tmpd0t9d_4x.py", line 3, in display_weather_forecast
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'sunny 25 60'
