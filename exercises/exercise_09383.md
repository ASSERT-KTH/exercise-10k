## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division and remainder.
    
    Args:
        dividend (int or float): The number being divided.
        divisor (int or float): The number by which we are dividing.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the division result and the remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    
    division_result = dividend / divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    
    return division_result, remainder

def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = float(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    try:
        # Calculate and print the division and remainder
        division_result, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {division_result} with a remainder of {remainder}.")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp4jthdpb5.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp4jthdpb5.py", line 22, in main
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '17 5'
```
