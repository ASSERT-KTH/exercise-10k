## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and an element as input and returns the indices of all occurrences of the element.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_indices(array, element):
    """
    Returns the indices of all occurrences of the element in the array.
    
    Args:
        array (list): The input array.
        element: The element to find.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of indices where the element is found.
    """
    return [i for i, x in enumerate(array) if x == element]

# Example usage:
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
element = 2
print(find_indices(array, element))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 3, 5]
```
