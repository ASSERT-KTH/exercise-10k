## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and a reduction function as input and returns the result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduce(arr, fn):
    result = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        result = fn(result, arr[i])
    return result

# Test cases
print(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lambda x, y: x + y))  # Output: 15
print(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lambda x, y: x * y))  # Output: 120
```

## Generated Output
```
15
120
```
