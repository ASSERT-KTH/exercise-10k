## Exercise
Create a program that takes a directory path as input and organizes the files in the directory based on their extensions.

## Reference Solution
```python
import os
import shutil

def organize_files(directory_path):
    """
    Organizes files in a directory based on their extensions.

    Args:
        directory_path (str): The path to the directory to be organized.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Check if the directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(directory_path):
        print("The specified directory does not exist.")
        return

    # Iterate over each file in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):
        # Get the file path
        file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, filename)

        # Check if it's a file (not a directory)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            # Get the file extension
            file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1][1:]

            # Create a directory for the file extension if it doesn't exist
            extension_dir = os.path.join(directory_path, file_extension)
            if not os.path.exists(extension_dir):
                os.makedirs(extension_dir)

            # Move the file to the extension directory
            shutil.move(file_path, extension_dir)
            print(f"Moved {filename} to {extension_dir}")

    print("File organization complete.")

def main():
    directory_path = input("Enter the directory path: ")
    organize_files(directory_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the directory path: The specified directory does not exist.
```
