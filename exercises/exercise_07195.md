## Exercise
Write a program to print the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: "))
print("The first {} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: ".format(n))
print(fibonacci(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
