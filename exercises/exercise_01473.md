## Exercise
Write a program that takes three integer inputs from the user, finds the minimum and maximum values, and prints the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

# Read input from user
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

# Find minimum and maximum values
min_val = min(a, b, c)
max_val = max(a, b, c)

# Print results
print(min_val)
print(max_val)
```

## Generated Output
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmph_7gqby8.py", line 4, in <module>
    a = int(input())
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10, 20, 30'
```
