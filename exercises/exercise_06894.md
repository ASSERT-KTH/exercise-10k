## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the average grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the average grades for each student.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Check if the list of grades is not empty
        if len(grades) > 0:
            # Calculate the sum of all grades
            total_grade = sum(grades)
            
            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of grades
            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
            
            # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
            average_grades[student] = average_grade
        else:
            # If the list of grades is empty, store None as the average grade
            average_grades[student] = None

    # Return the dictionary with the average grades
    return average_grades

# Example usage:
grades = {
    'John': [90, 85, 95],
    'Alice': [88, 92, 89],
    'Bob': []
}

print(calculate_average_grades(grades))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90.0, 'Alice': 89.66666666666667, 'Bob': None}
```
