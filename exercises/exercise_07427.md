## Exercise
Create a function named 'calculator' that takes in two numbers and an operator as arguments. The function should perform the operation based on the operator and return the result. The operators can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'. If the operator is not one of these, the function should return 'Invalid operator'. If the operator is '/' and the second number is 0, the function should return 'Cannot divide by zero'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculator(num1, num2, operator):
    """
    This function performs basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operator (str): The operator to be used for the operation. It can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the operation if the operator is valid and the operation is successful.
        str: 'Invalid operator' if the operator is not one of the four basic arithmetic operators.
        str: 'Cannot divide by zero' if the operator is '/' and the second number is 0.
    """

    # First, we check if the operator is '/' and the second number is 0
    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:
        # If this condition is true, we return 'Cannot divide by zero'
        return 'Cannot divide by zero'

    # Then, we check if the operator is one of the four basic arithmetic operators
    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
        # If the operator is not one of these, we return 'Invalid operator'
        return 'Invalid operator'

    # If the operator is '+', we perform addition and return the result
    if operator == '+':
        # We use the built-in '+' operator to perform the addition
        return num1 + num2

    # If the operator is '-', we perform subtraction and return the result
    elif operator == '-':
        # We use the built-in '-' operator to perform the subtraction
        return num1 - num2

    # If the operator is '*', we perform multiplication and return the result
    elif operator == '*':
        # We use the built-in '*' operator to perform the multiplication
        return num1 * num2

    # If the operator is '/', we perform division and return the result
    elif operator == '/':
        # We use the built-in '/' operator to perform the division
        return num1 / num2
