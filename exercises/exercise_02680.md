## Exercise
Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the characters that are common to both strings.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_characters(str1, str2):
    """
    Returns the characters that are common to both input strings.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): The first input string.
        str2 (str): The second input string.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of common characters.
    """
    # Convert both strings to sets of characters
    set1 = set(str1)
    set2 = set(str2)
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common characters)
    common = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and return it
    return list(common)

def main():
    # Example usage
    str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
    
    common = common_characters(str1, str2)
    print("Common characters:", common)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first string: Enter the second string: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkwp4xom0.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkwp4xom0.py", line 25, in main
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
