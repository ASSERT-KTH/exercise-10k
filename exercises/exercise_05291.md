## Exercise
Create a program that generates Pascal's triangle up to the nth row, where n is a user-inputted value. Use a for loop to iterate over the rows.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate Pascal's triangle up to the nth row.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of rows to generate.

    Returns:
    list: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.
    """

    # Initialize the triangle with the first row
    triangle = [[1]]

    # Iterate over the remaining rows
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Initialize the current row with the first element (1)
        row = [1]

        # Calculate the middle elements of the current row
        for j in range(1, i):
            # The jth element in the current row is the sum of the (j-1)th and jth elements in the previous row
            row.append(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j])

        # Append the last element (1) to the current row
        row.append(1)

        # Append the current row to the triangle
        triangle.append(row)

    return triangle


def print_pascals_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print Pascal's triangle in a readable format.

    Args:
    triangle (list): A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.
    """

    # Iterate over the rows in the triangle
    for i, row in enumerate(triangle):
        # Print leading spaces to center the triangle
        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - i - 1), end='')

        # Print the elements in the current row
        for num in row:
            print(f'{num} ', end='')

        # Move to the next line
        print()


def main():
    # Get the number of rows from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))

    # Generate Pascal's triangle
    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)

    # Print Pascal's triangle
    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows:     1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
```
