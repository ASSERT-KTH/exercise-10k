## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary and a value, and returns the key associated with that value if it exists, otherwise returns 'Value not found'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_key(dictionary, value):
    """
    This function finds the key associated with a given value in a dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        value: The value to search for.
    
    Returns:
        The key associated with the value if it exists, otherwise 'Value not found'.
    """
    
    # First, we'll iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary
    for key, val in dictionary.items():
        
        # For each pair, we'll check if the value matches the one we're looking for
        if val == value:
            
            # If we find a match, we'll return the corresponding key
            return key
    
    # If we've iterated over the entire dictionary and haven't found a match, we'll return 'Value not found'
    return 'Value not found'

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(find_key(my_dict, 2))  # Output: 'b'
print(find_key(my_dict, 4))  # Output: 'Value not found'
```

## Generated Output
```
b
Value not found
```
