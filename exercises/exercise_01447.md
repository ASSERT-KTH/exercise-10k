## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs their average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the input numbers.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    try:
        average = calculate_average(numbers)
        print(f"The average of {numbers} is {average}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
```
