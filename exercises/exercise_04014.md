## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to sum the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize the sum and the counter
total_sum = 0
i = 1

# Use a while loop to sum the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10
while i <= 10:
    # Add the square of the current number to the sum
    total_sum += i ** 2
    # Increment the counter
    i += 1

# Print the result
print("The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total_sum)
```

```python
total_sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total_sum += i ** 2
print("The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total_sum)
```

```python
total_sum = sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11))
print("The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total_sum)
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is: 385
```
