## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank account transaction system. The system should allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Use a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit. Use a for loop to display the transaction history.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        """
        Initialize the bank account with a balance of 0.
        """
        self.balance = balance
        self.transaction_history = []

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposit a specified amount into the bank account.
        """
        self.balance += amount
        self.transaction_history.append(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraw a specified amount from the bank account if sufficient funds are available.
        """
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
            self.transaction_history.append(f"Withdrawal of ${amount:.2f} failed")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            self.transaction_history.append(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}")

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Display the current balance of the bank account.
        """
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def display_transaction_history(self):
        """
        Display the transaction history of the bank account.
        """
        print("\nTransaction History:")
        for i, transaction in enumerate(self.transaction_history, start=1):
            print(f"{i}. {transaction}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()
    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Transaction System")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Display Transaction History")
        print("5. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: $"))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: $"))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            account.display_transaction_history()
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
