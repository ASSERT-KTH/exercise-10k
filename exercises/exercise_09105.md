## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all the even numbers removed. The function should also return the count of even numbers removed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_even_numbers(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers as input, removes all the even numbers from the list, 
    and returns a new list with only the odd numbers along with the count of even numbers removed.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the new list with only odd numbers and the count of even numbers removed.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []

    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of even numbers removed
    even_count = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in input_list:
        # Check if the number is even by using the modulus operator
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is even, increment the even count
            even_count += 1
        else:
            # If the number is odd, add it to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(num)

    # Return a tuple containing the list of odd numbers and the count of even numbers removed
    return odd_numbers, even_count


# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
odd_numbers, even_count = remove_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
print("Even numbers removed:", even_count)
```

## Generated Output
```
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5]
Even numbers removed: 3
```
