## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to generate a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(formula, initial_value, max_value):
    """
    Generate a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.

    Args:
        formula (function): A function that takes a number and returns the next number in the sequence.
        initial_value (int): The initial value of the sequence.
        max_value (int): The maximum value in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.
    """
    sequence = [initial_value]
    current_value = initial_value

    while current_value <= max_value:
        next_value = formula(current_value)
        sequence.append(next_value)
        current_value = next_value

    return sequence


# Define a formula function
def formula(x):
    """
    A simple formula that doubles the input number.

    Args:
        x (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The next number in the sequence.
    """
    return x * 2


# Generate a sequence of numbers based on the formula
initial_value = 1
max_value = 100
sequence = generate_sequence(formula, initial_value, max_value)

# Print the generated sequence
print(sequence)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
```
