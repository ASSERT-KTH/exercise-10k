## Exercise
Write a function to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node):
    """
    This function finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

    Args:
    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a dictionary of neighboring nodes and their respective edge weights.
    start_node (str): The node to start the search from.
    end_node (str): The node to find the shortest path to.

    Returns:
    shortest_path (list): A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
    shortest_distance (int): The total weight of the shortest path.
    """

    # Initialize the distance to the start node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0

    # Initialize the priority queue with the start node
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]

    # Initialize the previous nodes dictionary to keep track of the shortest path
    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}

    while priority_queue:
        # Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

            shortest_path.reverse()
            return shortest_path, current_distance

        # Iterate over the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # If the calculated distance is less than the already known distance, update the distance and previous node
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:

                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # If there is no path to the end node, return None
    return None, None


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
    }

    start_node = 'A'
    end_node = 'D'

    shortest_path, shortest_distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)

    if shortest_path is not None:
        print(f"The shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node} is: {shortest_path}")
        print(f"The shortest distance is: {shortest_distance}")
    else:
        print(f"There is no path from {start_node} to {end_node}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The shortest path from A to D is: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
The shortest distance is: 4
