## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary and a key as input and returns the value for the given key if it exists in the dictionary. If the key does not exist, return 'Key not found'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    This function retrieves the value for a given key from a dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key (any): The key to search for.
    
    Returns:
        any: The value associated with the key if found, 'Key not found' otherwise.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    # We use the 'in' keyword to check if the key is present in the dictionary
    if key in dictionary:
        
        # If the key exists, we return the corresponding value
        # We use the dictionary's indexing syntax to access the value
        return dictionary[key]
    
    # If the key does not exist, we return 'Key not found'
    # This is the default behavior when the key is not found in the dictionary
    else:
        return 'Key not found'

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(get_value(my_dict, 'a'))  # Output: 1
print(get_value(my_dict, 'd'))  # Output: Key not found
```

## Generated Output
```
1
Key not found
```
