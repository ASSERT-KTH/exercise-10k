Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Use the function to calculate the factorial of 5.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

result = factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5 is: ", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Factorial of 5 is:  120
```
