## Exercise
Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the unique characters in both strings.

## Reference Solution
```python
def unique_chars(str1, str2):
    """
    Returns the unique characters in both strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first string.
        str2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        set: A set of unique characters in both strings.
    """
    # Convert the strings to sets of characters
    set1 = set(str1)
    set2 = set(str2)

    # Find the union of the two sets (all unique characters in both strings)
    unique_chars = set1.union(set2)

    return unique_chars


def main():
    # Test the function
    str1 = "hello"
    str2 = "world"
    print("Unique characters in '{}' and '{}' are:".format(str1, str2))
    print(unique_chars(str1, str2))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
