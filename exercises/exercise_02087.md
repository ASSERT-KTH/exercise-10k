## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the product of a set of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_product(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a set of numbers separated by space: ")
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]
    product = calculate_product(numbers)
    print("The product of the numbers is: ", product)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
import math

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a set of numbers separated by space: ")
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]
    product = math.prod(numbers)
    print("The product of the numbers is: ", product)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a set of numbers separated by space: The product of the numbers is:  120
