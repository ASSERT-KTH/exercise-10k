## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists and returns a dictionary with the elements from the first list as keys and the elements from the second list as values

## Reference Solution
```python
def lists_to_dict(keys, values):
    """
    Create a dictionary from two lists.

    Args:
        keys (list): The list of keys for the dictionary.
        values (list): The list of values for the dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the elements from the first list are keys and the elements from the second list are values.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the lengths of the two lists are not equal.
    """
    if len(keys) != len(values):
        raise ValueError("The lengths of the two lists must be equal.")

    return dict(zip(keys, values))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    keys_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    values_list = [1, 2, 3]

    try:
        result_dict = lists_to_dict(keys_list, values_list)
        print(result_dict)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}
```
