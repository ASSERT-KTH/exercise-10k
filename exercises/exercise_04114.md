## Exercise
Write a program that uses conditional statements with variables to make decisions based on the values of the variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Conditional Statements Program

# Define variables
age = 25
name = "John"
grade = "A"

# Conditional statement to check if the person is eligible to vote
if age >= 18:
    print(f"{name} is eligible to vote.")
else:
    print(f"{name} is not eligible to vote.")

# Conditional statement to check if the person has a high grade
if grade == "A":
    print(f"{name} has a high grade.")
elif grade == "B":
    print(f"{name} has a good grade.")
else:
    print(f"{name} needs to improve their grade.")

# Conditional statement to check if the person is a student
is_student = True
if is_student:
    print(f"{name} is a student.")
else:
    print(f"{name} is not a student.")

# Conditional statement to check if the person has a certain age
if age < 13:
    print(f"{name} is a child.")
elif age < 20:
    print(f"{name} is a teenager.")
elif age < 65:
    print(f"{name} is an adult.")
else:
    print(f"{name} is a senior citizen.")
```

## Generated Output
```
John is eligible to vote.
John has a high grade.
John is a student.
