## Exercise
Write a program that performs arithmetic operations on two variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define two variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Print the results
print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2.0
```
