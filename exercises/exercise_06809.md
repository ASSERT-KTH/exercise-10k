## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and checks if it is within a certain range. If the score is 90 or above, print 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, print 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, print 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, print 'D'. If the score is below 60, print 'F'. Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user input
pontos = int(input("Digite sua nota: "))

# Check if pontos is within the valid range
if pontos < 0 or pontos > 100:
    print("Nota inválida!")
else:
    # Evaluate pontos and print the corresponding grade
    if pontos >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif pontos >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif pontos >= 70:
        print("C")
    elif pontos >= 60:
        print("D")
    else:
        print("F")

# Wait for user input before exiting
input()
```

## Generated Output
```
Digite sua nota: B

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbfvujna1.py", line 21, in <module>
    input()
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
