## Exercise
Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return x / y
```

## Generated Output
```
