    Args:
    year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)


def main():
    # Example usage:
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
