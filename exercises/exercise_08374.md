## Exercise
Write a program that uses Horner's method to evaluate a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point.

## Reference Solution
```python
def horner_polynomial_evaluation(coefficients, x):
    """
    Evaluate a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point using Horner's method.

    Parameters:
    coefficients (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial, where coefficients[i] is the coefficient of x^i.
    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

    Returns:
    float: The value of the polynomial at the given point.
    """
    result = 0
    for coefficient in reversed(coefficients):
        result = result * x + coefficient
    return result

# Example usage:
coefficients = [1, 2, 3]  # corresponds to the polynomial 1 + 2x + 3x^2
x = 2.0
result = horner_polynomial_evaluation(coefficients, x)
print(f"The value of the polynomial at x = {x} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The value of the polynomial at x = 2.0 is 17.0
```
