## Exercise
Given a list of integers, write a program to filter out elements that meet a specific condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(condition, numbers):
    """
    Filter out elements from a list of integers based on a condition.

    Args:
        condition (function): A function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers that meet the condition.
    """
    return [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Define a condition function to filter out even numbers
    def is_even(num):
        return num % 2 == 0

    # Filter out even numbers
    even_numbers = filter_list(is_even, numbers)
    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)

    # Define a condition function to filter out numbers greater than 5
    def is_greater_than_5(num):
        return num > 5

    # Filter out numbers greater than 5
    numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_list(is_greater_than_5, numbers)
    print("Numbers greater than 5:", numbers_greater_than_5)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Numbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
