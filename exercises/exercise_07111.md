## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades. Calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(student_grades):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each student in the dictionary.

    Args:
        student_grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """
    average_grades = {}
    for student, grades in student_grades.items():
        # Calculate the sum of grades using the built-in sum function
        total_grades = sum(grades)
        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of grades
        average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)
        # Store the average grade in the new dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade
    return average_grades

# Example usage:
student_grades = {
    "Alice": [90, 85, 95],
    "Bob": [80, 75, 85],
    "Charlie": [95, 90, 92]
}
average_grades = calculate_average_grades(student_grades)
print(average_grades)
```

```python
def calculate_average_grades(student_grades):
    return {student: sum(grades) / len(grades) for student, grades in student_grades.items()}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'Alice': 90.0, 'Bob': 80.0, 'Charlie': 92.33333333333333}
```
