## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and replaces all occurrences of a specific element with a new element. The program should prompt the user for the array, the element to be replaced, and the new element.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

# Prompt user for input
my_list = input("Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
n = input("Please enter the number to replace: ")
j = input("Please enter the new number: ")

# Convert input into lists and integers
my_list = my_list.split()
my_list = [int(x) for x in my_list]
n = int(n)
j = int(j)

# Replace occurrences of n with j
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] == n:
        my_list[i] = j

# Print the modified list
print(my_list)
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: Please enter the number to replace: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxsp_1fcv.py", line 5, in <module>
    n = input("Please enter the number to replace: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
