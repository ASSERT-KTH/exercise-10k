## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip given the cost of the meal and the tip percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of a meal including a tip.

    Args:
        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.
        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost of the meal including the tip.
    """
    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)
    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount
    return total_cost

def main():
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
    tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (%): "))
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)
    print(f"Total cost of the meal including a {tip_percentage}% tip: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the cost of the meal: $
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpzeuoik59.py", line 17, in main
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
