## Exercise
Write a program that takes a length in meters as input and returns its equivalent length in feet.

## Reference Solution
```python
def meters_to_feet(meters):
    """
    Convert a length in meters to feet.

    Args:
        meters (float): The length in meters.

    Returns:
        float: The equivalent length in feet.
    """
    conversion_factor = 3.28084  # 1 meter = 3.28084 feet
    feet = meters * conversion_factor
    return feet

def main():
    # Get the length in meters from the user
    meters = float(input("Enter a length in meters: "))

    # Convert the length to feet
    feet = meters_to_feet(meters)

    # Print the result
    print(f"{meters} meters is equivalent to {feet:.2f} feet.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a length in meters: 10.0 meters is equivalent to 32.81 feet.
```
