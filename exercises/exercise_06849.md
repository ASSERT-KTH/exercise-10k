## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operations to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):
    if operation == 'addition':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        if num2 != 0:
            return num1 / num2
        else:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'")

def main():
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ")
    
    try:
        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)
        print(f"The result of {operation} is {result}")
    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpunm9f2o8.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpunm9f2o8.py", line 17, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5 addition'
```
