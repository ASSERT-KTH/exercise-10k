## Exercise
Write a program to print the elements of a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a while loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_elements(lst, condition):
    """
    Prints the elements of a list that meet a specific condition.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to iterate over.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean.
    """
    i = 0
    while i < len(lst):
        if condition(lst[i]):
            print(lst[i])
        i += 1

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
condition = lambda x: x > 3

print("Numbers greater than 3:")
print_elements(numbers, condition)
```

## Generated Output
```
Numbers greater than 3:
4
5
6
```
