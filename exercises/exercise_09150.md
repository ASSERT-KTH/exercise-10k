## Reference Solution
```python
# Create a string variable
full_string = "Hello, World!"

# Extract a subset of characters using slicing
# The slicing syntax is [start:stop:step]
# Here, we're extracting from the 7th character to the 12th character
subset_string = full_string[7:12]

# Print out the subset
print("Original String:", full_string)
print("Subset of String:", subset_string)
```
