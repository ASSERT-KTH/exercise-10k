## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for the weight of a package and calculates the shipping cost based on the following rates: $2.50 per pound for packages up to 2 pounds, $2.00 per pound for packages between 2 and 6 pounds, and $1.50 per pound for packages over 6 pounds.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight):
    """
    Calculate the shipping cost of a package based on its weight.

    The shipping rates are:
    - $2.50 per pound for packages up to 2 pounds
    - $2.00 per pound for packages between 2 and 6 pounds
    - $1.50 per pound for packages over 6 pounds

    Args:
        weight (float): The weight of the package in pounds.

    Returns:
        float: The shipping cost of the package.
    """

    if weight <= 2:
        # Packages up to 2 pounds cost $2.50 per pound
        cost = weight * 2.50
    elif weight <= 6:
        # Packages between 2 and 6 pounds cost $2.00 per pound
        cost = weight * 2.00
    else:
        # Packages over 6 pounds cost $1.50 per pound
        cost = weight * 1.50

    return cost


def main():
    # Ask the user for the weight of the package
    while True:
        try:
            weight = float(input("Enter the weight of the package in pounds: "))
            if weight < 0:
                print("Weight cannot be negative. Please try again.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

    # Calculate the shipping cost
    cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight)

    # Print the shipping cost
    print(f"The shipping cost for a package weighing {weight} pounds is: ${cost:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the weight of the package in pounds: The shipping cost for a package weighing 5.0 pounds is: $10.00
```
