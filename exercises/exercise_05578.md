## Exercise
Write a program that allows the user to converse with a chatbot, responding to user input with pre-defined responses.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a dictionary with pre-defined responses
responses = {
    "hello": ["Hi, how are you?", "Hello! How can I assist you?", "Hi, what's up?"],
    "how are you": ["I'm doing great, thanks for asking!", "I'm good, thanks!", "I'm just a chatbot, I don't have feelings."],
    "what is your name": ["My name is Chatbot", "I'm an AI chatbot", "You can call me CB"],
    "default": ["I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?", "Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.", "Can you please provide more context?"]
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """
    Returns a response based on the user's input.

    Args:
    user_input (str): The user's input.

    Returns:
    str: The chatbot's response.
    """
    # Convert the user's input to lowercase
    user_input = user_input.lower()

    # Check if the user's input is in the responses dictionary
    if user_input in responses:
        # Return a random response from the list of responses
        return random.choice(responses[user_input])
    else:
        # Return a default response if the user's input is not recognized
        return random.choice(responses["default"])

def main():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.")
    while True:
        # Get the user's input
        user_input = input("User: ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_input.lower() == "quit":
            break

        # Get the chatbot's response
        response = get_response(user_input)

        # Print the chatbot's response
        print("Chatbot:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
User: Chatbot: Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
User: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp86lo_4kl.py", line 50, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp86lo_4kl.py", line 37, in main
    user_input = input("User: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
