## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the new salary of an employee given their current salary and pay raise percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the new salary
def calculate_new_salary(current_salary, pay_raise_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the new salary of an employee given their current salary and pay raise percentage.

    Args:
        current_salary (float): The current salary of the employee.
        pay_raise_percentage (float): The pay raise percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The new salary of the employee.
    """
    # Calculate the pay raise amount
    pay_raise_amount = (pay_raise_percentage / 100) * current_salary
    
    # Calculate the new salary
    new_salary = current_salary + pay_raise_amount
    
    return new_salary

# Main function
def main():
    # Get the current salary and pay raise percentage from the user
    current_salary = float(input("Enter the current salary: "))
    pay_raise_percentage = float(input("Enter the pay raise percentage: "))

    # Calculate the new salary
    new_salary = calculate_new_salary(current_salary, pay_raise_percentage)

    # Print the new salary
    print(f"The new salary is: ${new_salary:.2f}")

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current salary: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp35dx32ga.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp35dx32ga.py", line 24, in main
    current_salary = float(input("Enter the current salary: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '40000 10'
