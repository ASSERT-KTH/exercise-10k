## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    total = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(numbers):
        total += numbers[i]
        i += 1
    return total / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", average)
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers, or None if the input list is empty.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return None
    total = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(numbers):
        total += numbers[i]
        i += 1
    return total / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
if average is not None:
    print("The average is:", average)
else:
    print("The input list is empty.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The average is: 3.0
```
