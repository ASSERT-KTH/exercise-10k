## Exercise
Write a program to count the number of fruits in a basket. The program will receive a list of fruits as input and output the total count. Use a for loop to iterate over the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_fruits(fruit_list):
    """
    Counts the number of fruits in a basket.

    Args:
        fruit_list (list): A list of fruits.

    Returns:
        int: The total count of fruits.
    """
    total_count = 0
    for fruit in fruit_list:
        total_count += 1
    return total_count

def main():
    # Example usage:
    fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
    print("Fruits in the basket: ", fruits)
    print("Total count of fruits: ", count_fruits(fruits))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def count_fruits(fruit_list):
    """
    Counts the number of fruits in a basket.

    Args:
        fruit_list (list): A list of fruits.

    Returns:
        int: The total count of fruits.
    """
    return len(fruit_list)

def main():
    # Example usage:
    fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
    print("Fruits in the basket: ", fruits)
    print("Total count of fruits: ", count_fruits(fruits))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Fruits in the basket:  ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']
Total count of fruits:  5
```
