## Exercise
Given a dictionary with names of students as keys and their grades as values, write a program to map a function to each value in the dictionary and print the resulting dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade_level(grade):
    """
    Calculate the grade level based on the given grade.
    
    Args:
        grade (float): The grade of the student.
    
    Returns:
        str: The grade level of the student.
    """
    if grade >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def map_function_to_dict(input_dict, func):
    """
    Map a function to each value in the dictionary.
    
    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary with student names as keys and grades as values.
        func (function): The function to be applied to each value in the dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: The resulting dictionary with the function applied to each value.
    """
    return {key: func(value) for key, value in input_dict.items()}

# Example usage
student_grades = {
    "John": 85,
    "Alice": 92,
    "Bob": 78,
    "Charlie": 95,
    "David": 68
}

resulting_dict = map_function_to_dict(student_grades, calculate_grade_level)

print("Resulting Dictionary:")
for student, grade_level in resulting_dict.items():
    print(f"{student}: {grade_level}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Resulting Dictionary:
John: B
Alice: A
Bob: C
Charlie: A
David: D
```
