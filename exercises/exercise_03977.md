## Exercise
Write a program that finds the first missing positive integer in an array of integers. The program should take an array of integers as input and output the first missing positive integer.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, A):
        A = [0] + A
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(1, n):
            while 1 <= A[i] <= n and A[A[i]] != A[i]:
                A[A[i]], A[i] = A[i], A[A[i]]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if A[i] != i:
                return i
        return n

# Test the solution
solution = Solution()
A = [3, 4, -1, 1]
print(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 2

A = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]
print(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 1

A = [1, 2, 0]
print(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
2
1
3
```
