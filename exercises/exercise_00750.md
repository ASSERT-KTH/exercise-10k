        "windy": "Hold onto your hat! It's a bit breezy today.",
    }

    return weather_messages.get(weather.lower(), "I'm not sure what to say about this weather...")

def main():
    weather = input("Enter the current weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, windy): ")
    message = get_weather_message(weather)
    print(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
