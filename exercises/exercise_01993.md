## Exercise
Write a program to calculate a discount based on the total cost using conditional statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(total_cost):
    """
    Calculate the discount based on the total cost.

    Args:
        total_cost (float): The total cost of the purchase.

    Returns:
        float: The discount amount.
    """
    if total_cost < 100:
        discount_rate = 0
    elif 100 <= total_cost <= 500:
        discount_rate = 0.05
    elif 501 <= total_cost <= 1000:
        discount_rate = 0.10
    else:
        discount_rate = 0.15

    discount_amount = total_cost * discount_rate
    return discount_amount

def main():
    total_cost = float(input("Enter the total cost: $"))
    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_cost)
    print(f"Discount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Total cost after discount: ${total_cost - discount_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total cost: $Discount: $5.00
Total cost after discount: $95.00
```
