## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball, a toy used for fortune-telling.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

class Magic8Ball:
    def __init__(self):
        self.responses = [
            "It is certain",
            "It is decidedly so",
            "Without a doubt",
            "Yes definitely",
            "You may rely on it",
            "As I see it, yes",
            "Most likely",
            "Outlook good",
            "Yes",
            "Signs point to yes",
            "Reply hazy try again",
            "Ask again later",
            "Better not tell you now",
            "Cannot predict now",
            "Concentrate and ask again",
            "Don't count on it",
            "My reply is no",
            "My sources say no",
            "Outlook not so good",
            "Very doubtful"
        ]

    def ask_question(self, question):
        """Ask the Magic 8-Ball a question and get a response"""
        print(f"You asked: {question}")
        response = random.choice(self.responses)
        print(f"Magic 8-Ball says: {response}")

def main():
    eight_ball = Magic8Ball()
    print("Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball Simulator!")
    while True:
        question = input("Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): ")
        if question.lower() == "quit":
            break
        eight_ball.ask_question(question)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball Simulator!
Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): You asked: Will I have a good day?
Magic 8-Ball says: Outlook good
Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit):

    question = input("Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): ")
