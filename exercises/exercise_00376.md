## Exercise
Create a function called 'calculate_grade' that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns their corresponding grade. The grade scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """

    # First, we check if the score is within the valid range of 0 to 100
    if not 0 <= score <= 100:
        # If the score is not within the valid range, we return an error message
        return "Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100."

    # If the score is 90 or above, the student gets an A
    if score >= 90:
        # We return the grade 'A'
        return 'A'

    # If the score is 80 or above but less than 90, the student gets a B
    elif score >= 80:
        # We return the grade 'B'
        return 'B'

    # If the score is 70 or above but less than 80, the student gets a C
    elif score >= 70:
        # We return the grade 'C'
        return 'C'

    # If the score is 60 or above but less than 70, the student gets a D
    elif score >= 60:
        # We return the grade 'D'
        return 'D'

    # If the score is less than 60, the student gets an F
    else:
        # We return the grade 'F'
        return 'F'
```
