## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade.

score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print("Your grade is: ", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score (0-100): Your grade is:  B
```
