## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a loop. The pattern should start with 1 and each subsequent row should have one more number than the previous row. The numbers in each row should be separated by a space. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2 1, 3 2 1, 4 3 2 1, 5 4 3 2 1

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pattern(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            print(j, end=' ')
        print()

# Test the function
print_pattern(5)
```

## Generated Output
```
1 
2 1 
3 2 1 
4 3 2 1 
5 4 3 2 1
```
