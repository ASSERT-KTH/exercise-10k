## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements that are in the first list but not in the second.

## Reference Solution
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [1, 3, 5]

def difference(a, b):
    difference = []
    for i in a:
        if i not in b:
            difference.append(i)
    return difference

print(difference(a, b))
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4]
```
