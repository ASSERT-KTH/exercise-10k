## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student passed or failed. The passing grade is 60. If the grade is 90 or above, the program should also output 'Excellent'. If the grade is between 80 and 89, the program should output 'Good'. If the grade is between 70 and 79, the program should output 'Fair'. If the grade is between 60 and 69, the program should output 'Pass'. If the grade is below 60, the program should output 'Fail'

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_grade(grade):
    """
    Evaluates a student's grade and outputs whether the student passed or failed.
    Also outputs a descriptive message based on the grade.

    Args:
        grade (int): The student's grade.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    if grade >= 90:
        print("Passed")
        print("Excellent")
    elif grade >= 80:
        print("Passed")
        print("Good")
    elif grade >= 70:
        print("Passed")
        print("Fair")
    elif grade >= 60:
        print("Passed")
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Failed")
        print("Fail")

# Example usage
grade = int(input("Enter the student's grade: "))
evaluate_grade(grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's grade: Passed
Good
```
