## Exercise
Write a program to find the first duplicate in an array of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_first_duplicate(arr):
    """
    Find the first duplicate in an array of integers.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The first duplicate found in the array. If no duplicates are found, returns None.
    """
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]
first_duplicate = find_first_duplicate(arr)

if first_duplicate is not None:
    print(f"The first duplicate found in the array is: {first_duplicate}")
else:
    print("No duplicates found in the array.")
```

## Generated Output
