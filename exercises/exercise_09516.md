## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Program to determine a student's grade based on their score

# Get the score from the user
score = float(input("Enter your score: "))

# Determine the grade using conditional statements
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    grade = 'D'
elif score < 60:
    grade = 'F'

# Print the grade
print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
