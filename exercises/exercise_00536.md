## Exercise
Implement a function to solve the tug of war problem, where the goal is to divide a set of integers into two subsets with equal sums.

## Reference Solution
```python
def tug_of_war(nums):
    """
    Divide a set of integers into two subsets with equal sums.

    Args:
    - nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    - tuple: Two subsets with equal sums.
    """
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to divide the set into two subsets with equal sums.
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return None

    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Create a 2D table to store the dynamic programming results.
    dp = [[False] * (target_sum + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and column of the table.
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = True
    
    # Fill the table using dynamic programming.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, target_sum + 1):
            if nums[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    
    # If it's impossible to divide the set into two subsets with equal sums, return None.
    if not dp[n][target_sum]:
        return None
    
    # Reconstruct the subsets using the dynamic programming table.
    subset1 = []
    subset2 = []
    i, j = n, target_sum
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            subset1.append(nums[i - 1])
            j -= nums[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    
    # Add the remaining numbers to subset2.
    for num in nums:
        if num not in subset1:
            subset2.append(num)
    
    return subset1, subset2


def main():
    # Example usage:
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    subsets = tug_of_war(nums)
    if subsets is not None:
        print("Subset 1:", subsets[0])
        print("Subset 2:", subsets[1])
    else:
        print("It's impossible to divide the set into two subsets with equal sums.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Generated Output
```
