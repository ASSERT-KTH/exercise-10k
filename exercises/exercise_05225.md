## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints 'Even' if all numbers in the array are even, and 'Odd' if at least one number is odd.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for num in a:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            print("Odd")
            return
    print("Even")

t = 1
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

## Generated Output
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmblqjdkd.py", line 14, in <module>
    solve()
  File "/tmp/tmpmblqjdkd.py", line 4, in solve
    n = int(input())
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[2, 4, 6]'
```
