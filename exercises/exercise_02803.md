## Exercise
Write a program to ask the user for two numbers and print their sum to the console.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Ask the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the sum to the console
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)
```

```python
$ python sum_program.py
Enter the first number: 3.5
Enter the second number: 2.8
The sum of the two numbers is: 6.3
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpasp_1fso.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
