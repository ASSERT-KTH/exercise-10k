## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns the difference between the two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def array_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first input array.
        arr2 (list): The second input array.

    Returns:
        list: The difference between the two arrays.
    """
    # Convert input lists to sets for efficient lookups
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)

    # Calculate the difference between the two sets
    diff1 = set1 - set2
    diff2 = set2 - set1

    # Combine the differences into a single list
    difference = list(diff1) + list(diff2)

    return difference

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    print("Array 1:", arr1)
    print("Array 2:", arr2)
    print("Difference:", array_difference(arr1, arr2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Array 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Difference: [1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 7]
```
