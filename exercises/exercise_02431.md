## Exercise
Create a program to manage bank accounts, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance, using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposit Successful. Your new balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance. Withdrawal failed.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawal Successful. Your new balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Your current balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Management System")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
