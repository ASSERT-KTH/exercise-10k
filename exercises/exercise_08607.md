## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring(string, substring):
    """
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.
    If the substring is not found, returns -1.
    """
    try:
        index = string.index(substring)
        return index
    except ValueError:
        return -1

# Example usage:
s = "hello world"
sub = "world"
print(find_substring(s, sub))  # Output: 6
```

## Generated Output
