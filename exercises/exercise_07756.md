## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the GPA of a student given their grades in different subjects. The program should use functions to calculate the GPA. The grades will be provided as a dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades. The GPA is calculated by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of subjects.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gpa(grades):
    """
    Calculate the GPA of a student given their grades in different subjects.

    Args:
    grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades.

    Returns:
    float: The calculated GPA.
    """
    # Check if the input dictionary is empty
    if not grades:
        return 0.0

    # Calculate the sum of all grades
    total_grades = sum(grades.values())

    # Calculate the total number of subjects
    total_subjects = len(grades)

    # Calculate the GPA
    gpa = total_grades / total_subjects

    return gpa


def main():
    # Example usage
    grades = {
        "Math": 3.8,
        "Science": 3.5,
        "English": 3.9,
        "History": 3.7
    }

    gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)
    print(f"The GPA is: {gpa:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The GPA is: 3.72
```
