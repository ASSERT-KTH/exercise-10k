## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula

## Reference Solution
```python
def sequence_generator(formula, start, end):
    """
    Generate a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.

    Args:
    - formula (function): A function that takes an integer as input and returns the next number in the sequence.
    - start (int): The starting number of the sequence.
    - end (int): The ending number of the sequence.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of numbers in the sequence.
    """
    sequence = []
    current = start
    while current <= end:
        sequence.append(current)
        current = formula(current)
    return sequence

# Example formula: f(n) = 2n + 1
def example_formula(n):
    return 2 * n + 1

# Generate the sequence
sequence = sequence_generator(example_formula, 1, 10)
print(sequence)
```

## Generated Output
```
