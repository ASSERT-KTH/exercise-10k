## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and an index as input, and removes the element at the specified index from the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_element_at_index(input_list, index):
    """
    This function removes the element at the specified index from the input list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list from which the element will be removed.
        index (int): The index of the element to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list after removing the element at the specified index.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list.
    # If it's not, we'll raise an IndexError with a descriptive message.
    if index < 0 or index >= len(input_list):
        raise IndexError("Index out of range")

    # Now, we can use the pop method of the list to remove the element at the specified index.
    # The pop method returns the removed element, but we don't need it in this case, so we'll ignore it.
    # We'll store the result in a variable to make the code more readable.
    removed_element = input_list.pop(index)

    # Finally, we'll return the modified list.
    # We don't need to do anything else here, because the pop method modified the list in-place.
    return input_list

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(remove_element_at_index(my_list, 2))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 4, 5]
```
