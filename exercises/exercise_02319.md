## Exercise
Write a program that generates and prints out a sequence of numbers (e.g. Fibonacci sequence, arithmetic sequence).

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates a Fibonacci sequence of length n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The length of the sequence.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence: "))
    sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)
    print("Fibonacci sequence of length {}:".format(n))
    print(sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence: Fibonacci sequence of length 10:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
