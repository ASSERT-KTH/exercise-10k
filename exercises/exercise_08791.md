## Exercise
Write a program that takes a distance in miles as input and returns its equivalent in kilometers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def miles_to_kilometers(miles):
    """
    Converts a distance in miles to kilometers.

    Args:
        miles (float): The distance in miles.

    Returns:
        float: The distance in kilometers.
    """
    kilometers = miles * 1.60934
    return kilometers

def main():
    # Get user input
    miles = float(input("Enter a distance in miles: "))

    # Convert miles to kilometers
    kilometers = miles_to_kilometers(miles)

    # Print the result
    print(f"{miles} miles is equal to {kilometers} kilometers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
