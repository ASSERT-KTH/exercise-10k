## Exercise
Create a program that filters a given list of variables based on their data types (e.g., only integers, only floats).

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_by_type(data, data_type):
    """
    Filters a list of variables based on their data types.

    Args:
        data (list): A list of variables to be filtered.
        data_type (type): The data type to filter by.

    Returns:
        list: A list of variables of the specified data type.
    """
    return [x for x in data if isinstance(x, data_type)]


# Example usage:
data = [1, 2.5, 'hello', 3, 4.7, 'world', 5, 6.9]

# Filter integers
integers = filter_by_type(data, int)
print("Integers:", integers)

# Filter floats
floats = filter_by_type(data, float)
print("Floats:", floats)

# Filter strings
strings = filter_by_type(data, str)
print("Strings:", strings)
```

## Generated Output
```
Integers: [1, 3, 5]
Floats: [2.5, 4.7, 6.9]
Strings: ['hello', 'world']
```
