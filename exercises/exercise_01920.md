## Exercise
Calculate the weighted average given a list of numbers and their respective weights.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_weighted_average(values, weights):
    """
    Calculate the weighted average given a list of numbers and their respective weights.

    Args:
        values (list): List of numbers
        weights (list): List of weights corresponding to each value

    Returns:
        float: Weighted average
    """
    if len(values) != len(weights):
        raise ValueError("Values and weights must have the same length")

    weighted_sum = sum(x * w for x, w in zip(values, weights))
    weight_sum = sum(weights)

    if weight_sum == 0:
        raise ValueError("Weights cannot sum to zero")

    return weighted_sum / weight_sum

# Example usage:
values = [10, 20, 30]
weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
weighted_average = calculate_weighted_average(values, weights)
print("Weighted Average:", weighted_average)
```

## Generated Output
```
Weighted Average: 23.0
```
