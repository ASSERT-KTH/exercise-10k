## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_change(amount, denominations):
    """
    Calculate the number of ways to make change for a given amount.

    Args:
    amount (int): The amount for which we want to make change.
    denominations (list): A list of available coin denominations.

    Returns:
    int: The number of ways to make change for the given amount.
    """
    # Create a list to store the number of ways to make change for each amount
    ways = [0] * (amount + 1)
    ways[0] = 1  # There is one way to make change for 0 amount (use no coins)

    # Iterate over each coin denomination
    for coin in denominations:
        # Iterate from the coin denomination to the amount
        i = coin
        while i <= amount:
            # The number of ways to make change for the current amount is the sum of
            # the number of ways to make change for the current amount without using
            # the current coin and the number of ways to make change for the amount
            # minus the current coin
            ways[i] += ways[i - coin]
            i += 1

    return ways[amount]

# Example usage:
amount = 10
denominations = [1, 5, 10]
print(f"Number of ways to make change for {amount}: {calculate_change(amount, denominations)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Number of ways to make change for 10: 4
```
