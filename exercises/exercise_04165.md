## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's name and 3 grades as input and prints the average grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate average grade
def calculate_average_grade(name, grade1, grade2, grade3):
    average_grade = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / 3
    return average_grade

# Main function
def main():
    # Get student's name and grades
    name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
    grade1 = float(input("Enter the student's first grade: "))
    grade2 = float(input("Enter the student's second grade: "))
    grade3 = float(input("Enter the student's third grade: "))

    # Calculate and print average grade
    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(name, grade1, grade2, grade3)
    print(f"{name}'s average grade is {average_grade:.2f}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's name: Enter the student's first grade: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpr2qwxx_3.py", line 20, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpr2qwxx_3.py", line 10, in main
    grade1 = float(input("Enter the student's first grade: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
