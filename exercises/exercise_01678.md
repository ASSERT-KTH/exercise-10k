## Exercise
Create a program that takes the applicant's income and credit score as input and determines if they are eligible for a loan based on the following criteria: income should be above 50000, and credit score should be above 600 using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score):
    """
    Checks if an applicant is eligible for a loan based on their income and credit score.

    Args:
        income (float): The applicant's income.
        credit_score (int): The applicant's credit score.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the applicant is eligible, False otherwise.
    """
    if income > 50000 and credit_score > 600:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    # Get input from user
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
    credit_score = int(input("Enter your credit score: "))

    # Check loan eligibility
    eligible = check_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score)

    # Print result
    if eligible:
        print("You are eligible for a loan.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible for a loan.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpt6av0ukp.py", line 19, in main
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
