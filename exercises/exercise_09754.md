## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_area_base_height(base, height):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.

    Args:
        base (float): The base of the triangle.
        height (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return (base * height) / 2

# Example usage:
base = 5
height = 6
area = calculate_area_base_height(base, height)
print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")
```

```python
import math

def calculate_area_heron(a, b, c):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides using Heron's formula.

    Args:
        a (float): The length of side a.
        b (float): The length of side b.
        c (float): The length of side c.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    return area

# Example usage:
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5
area = calculate_area_heron(a, b, c)
print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The area of the triangle is: 15.0
```
