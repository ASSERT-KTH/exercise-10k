    score = 0

    # Ask the user each question
    for question, options in questions.items():
        print(question)
        for option, value in options.items():
            if option != "Answer":
                print(f"{option}: {value}")
        answer = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
        if answer.upper() == options["Answer"]:
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer was {options['Answer']}.\n")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}")

# Run the quiz
if __name__ == "__main__":
    quiz()
