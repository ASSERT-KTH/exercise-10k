## Exercise
Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    elif (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock") or \
         (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper"):
        return "User"
    else:
        return "Computer"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user."""
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0

    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        elif user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")

        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == "Tie":
            print(f"It's a tie! The score is {user_score} - {computer_score}.")
        elif winner == "User":
            user_score += 1
            print(f"You win this round! The score is {user_score} - {computer_score}.")
        else:
            computer_score += 1
            print(f"The computer wins this round! The score is {user_score} - {computer_score}.")

    print(f"\nFinal score: {user_score} - {computer_score}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
