## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the result of a custom reduction operation, such as finding the maximum or minimum value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduction(arr):
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in arr:
        if i < ans:
            ans = i
    return ans

A = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(reduction(A))
```

## Generated Output
```
10
```
