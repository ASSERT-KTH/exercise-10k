## Exercise
Develop a program that checks if a given password meets the following requirements: at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validate a password based on the following requirements:
    - At least 8 characters long
    - Contains at least one uppercase letter
    - Contains at least one lowercase letter
    - Contains at least one digit

    Args:
        password (str): The password to validate

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise
    """
    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one digit
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        return False

    # If all checks pass, the password is valid
    return True

def main():
    # Example usage
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    if validate_password(password):
        print("Password is valid")
    else:
        print("Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following requirements:")
        print("* At least 8 characters long")
        print("* Contains at least one uppercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one lowercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one digit")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
