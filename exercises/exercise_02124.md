## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):
    """
    This function takes a list and two indices as input and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list.
        start_index (int): The starting index.
        end_index (int): The ending index.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the elements between the two indices.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a list and the indices are integers
    if not isinstance(input_list, list) or not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list and indices must be integers")

    # Then, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index
    if start_index > end_index:
        raise ValueError("Start index must be less than or equal to end index")

    # We also need to check if the start and end indices are within the bounds of the list
    if start_index < 0 or end_index > len(input_list):
        raise IndexError("Indices out of range")

    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to get the elements between the two indices
    # The slicing operation will return a new list containing the elements from the start index up to but not including the end index
    new_list = input_list[start_index:end_index]

    # Finally, we return the new list
    return new_list
```
