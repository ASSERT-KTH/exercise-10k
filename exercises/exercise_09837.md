## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Handle potential errors such as division by zero and invalid operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    This function performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operation (str): The operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.
        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.
    """

    # First, we check if the operation is valid
    if operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation. Operation must be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.")

    # Then, we perform the operation
    if operation == 'addition':
        # If the operation is addition, we simply add the two numbers
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        # If the operation is subtraction, we subtract the second number from the first
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        # If the operation is multiplication, we multiply the two numbers
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        # If the operation is division, we check if the second number is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        # If the second number is not zero, we divide the first number by the second
        result = num1 / num2

    # Finally, we return the result
    return result
```
