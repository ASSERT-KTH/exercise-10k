## Exercise
Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns -1 if the first string is less than the second string, 0 if the strings are equal, and 1 if the first string is greater than the second string.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This script compares two strings lexicographically.

def cmp_str(s1, s2):
    if s1 < s2:
        return -1
    elif s1 == s2:
        return 0
    elif s1 > s2:
        return 1

# Test the function
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "world"
print(cmp_str(s1, s2))  # Output: -1
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
