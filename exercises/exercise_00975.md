## Exercise
Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the intersection between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in both dictionaries.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dictionary_intersection(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function finds the intersection between two dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that exist in both input dictionaries.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the intersection
    intersection_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the first dictionary
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        
        # Check if the key exists in the second dictionary and has the same value
        if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value:
            
            # If the key-value pair exists in both dictionaries, add it to the intersection dictionary
            intersection_dict[key] = value
    
    # Return the intersection dictionary
    return intersection_dict

# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}

print(dictionary_intersection(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
