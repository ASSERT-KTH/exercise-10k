## Exercise
Create a program that validates a password using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    # Define password requirements
    min_length = 8
    has_uppercase = any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    has_lowercase = any(char.islower() for char in password)
    has_digit = any(char.isdigit() for char in password)
    has_special_char = bool(re.search(r"[!@#$%^&*()_+=-{};:'<>,./?]", password))

    # Check password requirements
    if len(password) < min_length:
        print("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")
    elif not has_uppercase:
        print("Password should have at least one uppercase letter.")
    elif not has_lowercase:
        print("Password should have at least one lowercase letter.")
    elif not has_digit:
        print("Password should have at least one digit.")
    elif not has_special_char:
        print("Password should have at least one special character.")
    else:
        print("Password is valid.")

def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    validate_password(password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password should have at least one uppercase letter.
