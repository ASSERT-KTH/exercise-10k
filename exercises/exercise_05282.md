## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is a user-inputted value. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Creation Date: [Today's Date]

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += i ** 2
    print(i ** 2)

print("The final answer is: ", sum)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1
4
9
16
25
The final answer is:  55
```
