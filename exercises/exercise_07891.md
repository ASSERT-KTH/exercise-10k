## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The system should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw or deposit. If the user wants to withdraw an amount that exceeds their balance, the program should print 'Insufficient balance'. If the user wants to deposit a negative amount, the program should print 'Invalid deposit amount'. Otherwise, the program should update the user's balance accordingly and print the new balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            print("Invalid deposit amount")
        else:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")


def main():
    # Create an instance of the BankAccount class with an initial balance of 1000
    account = BankAccount(1000)

    # Deposit $500
    account.deposit(500)

    # Withdraw $200
    account.withdraw(200)

    # Deposit a negative amount (-100)
    account.deposit(-100)

    # Withdraw an amount exceeding the balance (2000)
    account.withdraw(2000)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Deposited $500. New balance: $1500
Withdrew $200. New balance: $1300
Invalid deposit amount
Insufficient balance
```
