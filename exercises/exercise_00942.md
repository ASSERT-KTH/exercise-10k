## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    i = 1
    total = 0
    while i <= n:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
        i += 1
    return total

print(sum_even_numbers(10))
```

## Generated Output
```
