## Exercise
Create a program that takes in three numbers and outputs the maximum number based on the following conditions: if the first number is greater than the second and third numbers, output the first number, if the second number is greater than the first and third numbers, output the second number, if the third number is greater than the first and second numbers, output the third number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_number(num1, num2, num3):
    """
    This function takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number.
    
    The maximum number is determined based on the conditions:
    - If the first number is greater than the second and third numbers, return the first number.
    - If the second number is greater than the first and third numbers, return the second number.
    - If the third number is greater than the first and second numbers, return the third number.
    """
    
    # Check if the first number is greater than the second and third numbers
    if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
        return num1
    
    # Check if the second number is greater than the first and third numbers
    elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
        return num2
    
    # Check if the third number is greater than the first and second numbers
    elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:
        return num3

# Test the function
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

max_number = find_max_number(num1, num2, num3)
print("The maximum number is: ", max_number)
```

```python
def find_max_number(num1, num2, num3):
    return max(num1, num2, num3)

# Test the function
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

max_number = find_max_number(num1, num2, num3)
print("The maximum number is: ", max_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppd8w3k5c.py", line 24, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10, 20, 30'
```

```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
