## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing every other element from the original list, starting from the second element (index 1).

## Reference Solution
```python
def solve(numbers):
    new_list = []
    for i in range(1, len(numbers), 2):
        new_list.append(numbers[i])
    return new_list

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
print(solve(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
[20, 40, 60]
```
