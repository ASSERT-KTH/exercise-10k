## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists, in the order they appeared in the input list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list containing 
    all elements from the sublists, in the order they appeared in the input list.

    Args:
        nested_list (list): A list of lists.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []

    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in nested_list:
        # Iterate over each element in the current sublist
        for element in sublist:
            # Append the current element to the result list
            result.append(element)

    # Return the result list
    return result

# Example usage:
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(flatten_list(nested_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
