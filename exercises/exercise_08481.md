## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Given a score between 0 and 100, determine the grade based on the following conditions:
# A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)

# Define the grade function
def grade(score):
    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Define a helper function to check if the input is a valid score
def valid_score(score):
    return 0 <= score <= 100

# Define the convert_to_letter function
def convert_to_letter(score):
    # Check if the score is valid
    if valid_score(score):
        # Return the grade as a letter
        return grade(score)
    else:
        # Return an error message if the score is not valid
        return "Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100."

# Test the convert_to_letter function
print(convert_to_letter(90))  # Should print "A"
print(convert_to_letter(80))  # Should print "B"
print(convert_to_letter(70))  # Should print "C"
print(convert_to_letter(60))  # Should print "D"
print(convert_to_letter(50))  # Should print "F"
print(convert_to_letter(110))  # Should print "Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100."
```

## Generated Output
```
A
B
C
D
F
Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.
