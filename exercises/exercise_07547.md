## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, then uses another loop to print out the numbers from 10 to 1. The program should also calculate and print the sum of all the numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 1, sum = 0;

    while (num <= 10) {
        cout << num << endl;
        sum += num;
        num++;
    }

    num = 10;
    while (num >= 1) {
        cout << num << endl;
        num--;
    }

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
