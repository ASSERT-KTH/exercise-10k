## Exercise
Write a program that manages bank account transactions, using conditional statements to determine the transaction types

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance=0):
        """
        Initialize a bank account with account number, account name, and initial balance.

            account_name (str): Account holder's name.
            balance (float, optional): Initial account balance. Defaults to 0.
