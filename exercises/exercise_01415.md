## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random set of numbers for a lottery draw. If the user inputs the number of draws, generate that many sets of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def generate_lottery_numbers(num_draws, num_balls, max_ball):
    """
    Generate a random set of numbers for a lottery draw.

    Args:
        num_draws (int): The number of draws to generate.
        num_balls (int): The number of balls to draw each time.
        max_ball (int): The maximum number on the balls.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a set of numbers for a lottery draw.
    """
    lottery_numbers = []
    for _ in range(num_draws):
        draw = random.sample(range(1, max_ball + 1), num_balls)
        draw.sort()
        lottery_numbers.append(draw)
    return lottery_numbers

def main():
    num_draws = int(input("Enter the number of draws: "))
    num_balls = int(input("Enter the number of balls to draw each time: "))
    max_ball = int(input("Enter the maximum number on the balls: "))

    lottery_numbers = generate_lottery_numbers(num_draws, num_balls, max_ball)

    print("Lottery Numbers:")
    for i, draw in enumerate(lottery_numbers):
        print(f"Draw {i+1}: {draw}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of draws: Enter the number of balls to draw each time: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxzytzvw6.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpxzytzvw6.py", line 24, in main
    num_balls = int(input("Enter the number of balls to draw each time: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
