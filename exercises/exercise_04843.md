## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns their intersection.

## Reference Solution
```python
def array_intersection(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Returns the intersection of two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The intersection of arr1 and arr2.
    """
    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    intersection = array_intersection(arr1, arr2)
    print("Array 1:", arr1)
    print("Array 2:", arr2)
    print("Intersection:", intersection)
```

## Generated Output
```
Array 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Intersection: [4, 5]
```
