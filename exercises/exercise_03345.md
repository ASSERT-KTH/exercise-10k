## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to check if a given password is valid (length of at least 8 characters, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit).

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password(password):
    """
    Checks if a given password is valid.

    A valid password must have a length of at least 8 characters,
    contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize flags
    has_uppercase = False
    has_lowercase = False
    has_digit = False

    # Check each character in the password
    for char in password:
        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter
        if char.isupper():
            has_uppercase = True
        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter
        elif char.islower():
            has_lowercase = True
        # Check if the character is a digit
        elif char.isdigit():
            has_digit = True

    # Check if the password has a length of at least 8 characters
    # and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
    return (len(password) >= 8 and
            has_uppercase and
            has_lowercase and
            has_digit)


def main():
    # Example usage
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    if check_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: The password is valid.
```
