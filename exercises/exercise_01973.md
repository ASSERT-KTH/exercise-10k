## Exercise
Create a function that implements the mergesort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. The function should take a list as an argument and return the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def mergesort(list):
    # Base case: if the list has 0 or 1 elements, it is already sorted
    if len(list) <= 1:
        return list

    # Find the middle of the list
    mid = len(list) // 2

    # Split the list into two halves
    left = list[:mid]
    right = list[mid:]

    # Recursively sort the left and right halves
    left = mergesort(left)
    right = mergesort(right)

    # Merge the sorted left and right halves
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    result.extend(left)
    result.extend(right)
    return result
```
