## Exercise
Write a function to find the intersection between two dictionaries.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):
    """
    Finds the intersection between two dictionaries.

    Args:
    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
    dict: A new dictionary containing key-value pairs common to both input dictionaries.
    """
    # Use dictionary comprehension to find common key-value pairs
    intersection = {key: value for key, value in dict1.items() if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value}
    return intersection

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
    dict2 = {"a": 1, "b": 3, "d": 4}

    intersection = dict_intersection(dict1, dict2)
    print("Intersection:", intersection)
```

## Generated Output
```
Intersection: {'a': 1}
```
