## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the slope of a line

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculate the slope of a line given two points.

    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.

    Returns:
        float: The slope of the line.
    """
    if x2 - x1 == 0:
        raise ValueError("Vertical line detected. Slope is undefined.")
    slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    return slope

def main():
    # Example usage:
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    try:
        slope = calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        print(f"The slope of the line is: {slope}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpf1lwfd7n.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpf1lwfd7n.py", line 21, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 4 6'
```
