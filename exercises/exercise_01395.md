## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to display the weather forecast for the next 5 days.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary to store the weather forecast
weather_forecast = {
    "Day 1": "Sunny",
    "Day 2": "Cloudy",
    "Day 3": "Rainy",
    "Day 4": "Windy",
    "Day 5": "Sunny"
}

# Initialize a counter variable
day = 1

# Use a while loop to display the weather forecast
while day <= 5:
    # Print the weather forecast for the current day
    print(f"Weather forecast for Day {day}: {weather_forecast[f'Day {day}']}")
    
    # Increment the counter variable
    day += 1
```

## Generated Output
```
Weather forecast for Day 1: Sunny
Weather forecast for Day 2: Cloudy
Weather forecast for Day 3: Rainy
Weather forecast for Day 4: Windy
Weather forecast for Day 5: Sunny
```
