## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements, and then prints the first and last elements of the reversed list. If the list has less than two elements, print a message indicating that the list is too short.

## Reference Solution
```python
# List Reversal Program

# Define a function to reverse the list
def reverse_list(num):
    num.reverse()
    return num

# Define a function to print the first and last elements
def print_first_last(num):
    if len(num) < 2:
        print("list is too short")
    else:
        print(num[0], num[-1])

# Main function
def main():
    num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    num = reverse_list(num)
    print_first_last(num)

# Call the main function
main()
```
