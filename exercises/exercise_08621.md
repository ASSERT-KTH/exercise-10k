## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters rearranged to form a palindrome.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def make_palindrome(s):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters rearranged to form a palindrome.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string.
    
    Returns:
    str: A palindrome string.
    """
    
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Initialize variables to store the first half of the palindrome and the middle character
    first_half = ''
    middle = ''
    
    # Iterate over the character counts
    for char, count in char_count.items():
        # If the count is odd, add the character to the middle
        if count % 2 != 0:
            # If there's already a middle character, return an error message because it's impossible to make a palindrome
            if middle:
                return "Error: Cannot make a palindrome with more than one character having an odd count."
            middle = char
        # Add half of the characters to the first half of the palindrome
        first_half += char * (count // 2)
    
    # Create the palindrome by concatenating the first half, the middle, and the reverse of the first half
    palindrome = first_half + middle + first_half[::-1]
    
    return palindrome

# Test the function
print(make_palindrome("abcba"))  # Output: "abcba"
print(make_palindrome("abccba"))  # Output: "abccba"
print(make_palindrome("abcd"))  # Output: "Error: Cannot make a palindrome with more than one character having an odd count."
```

## Generated Output
```
abcba
abccba
Error: Cannot make a palindrome with more than one character having an odd count.
```
