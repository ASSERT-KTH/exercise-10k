## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) and dashes (-) based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, where each row contains a combination of asterisks and dashes. The number of rows should be determined by the user. In each row, the number of asterisks should decrease by one from the previous row, and the number of dashes should increase by one from the previous row. The first row should start with the number of asterisks specified by the user and zero dashes.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: Print a pattern of asterisks and dashes based on user input

# Get the number of rows from the user
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))

# Get the number of asterisks in the first row from the user
asterisks = int(input("Enter the number of asterisks in the first row: "))

# Loop to print the pattern
for i in range(rows):
    # Print asterisks
    print("*" * asterisks, end="")

    # Print dashes
    print("-" * i, end="")

    # Print a newline character
    print()

    # Decrement the number of asterisks for the next row
    asterisks -= 1
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows: Enter the number of asterisks in the first row: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpfq6hspke.py", line 9, in <module>
    asterisks = int(input("Enter the number of asterisks in the first row: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
