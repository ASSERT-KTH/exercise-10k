## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is a palindrome. If it is, print 'Palindrome' otherwise print 'Not a palindrome'. The program should handle strings with spaces and special characters by removing them before checking for palindrome.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

s = input()
s = re.sub(r'\W+', '', s)
rev = s[::-1]
if rev == s:
    print('Palindrome')
else:
    print('Not a palindrome')
```

## Generated Output
```
Not a palindrome
```
