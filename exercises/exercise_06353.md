## Exercise
Explain the concept of a tuple data type and provide examples of declaring and using tuples.

## Reference Solution
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a)  # prints 1
print(b)  # prints 2
print(c)  # prints 3
```

```python
# Define a tuple to represent a person
person = ("John", 30, "New York")

# Access the fields of the person record
print(person[0])  # prints John
print(person[1])  # prints 30
print(person[2])  # prints New York
```

```python
# Define a tuple to represent a point in 2D space
point = (3, 4)

# Calculate the distance from the origin to the point
import math
distance = math.sqrt(point[0]**2 + point[1]**2)
print(distance)  # prints 5.0
```

## Generated Output
