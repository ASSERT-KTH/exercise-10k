## Exercise
Create a program that asks for the user's name and prints out a greeting message with their name. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether they are eligible to vote or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Print greeting message
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Print message related to voting eligibility
if age >= 18:
    print(f"Hi, {name}! You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print(f"Hi, {name}! You are not eligible to vote.")

# Terminate the program
print("Exiting the program...")

# Note: There is no need for a main() function or any other code in this program,
# as it is a simple script that runs from top to bottom.
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Hello, John!
Hi, John! You are eligible to vote.
Exiting the program...
```
