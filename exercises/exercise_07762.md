## Exercise
Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program should ask the user to choose the operation and then input the two numbers. It should then display the result of the operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Introduction
print("Welcome to the basic arithmetic operations program!")

# Function Definitions
def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtraction(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiplication(a, b):
    return a * b

def division(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero!"
    else:
        return a / b

# User Input
operation = input("Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ")
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Operation Execution
if operation == "+":
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {addition(num1, num2)}")
elif operation == "-":
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {subtraction(num1, num2)}")
elif operation == "*":
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {multiplication(num1, num2)}")
elif operation == "/":
    result = division(num1, num2)
    if isinstance(result, str):
        print(result)
    else:
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
else:
    print("Invalid operation. Please try again.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the basic arithmetic operations program!
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpr9q0o5h2.py", line 22, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Operation: + '
```
