## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the logarithm of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_logarithm(base, number):
    """
    Calculates the logarithm of a given number.

    Args:
        base (float): The base of the logarithm.
        number (float): The number for which the logarithm is to be calculated.

    Returns:
        float: The logarithm of the given number.
    """
    if base <= 0 or number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Base and number must be greater than 0")
    return math.log(number) / math.log(base)

def main():
    # Example usage
    base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
    number = float(input("Enter the number: "))
    try:
        logarithm = calculate_logarithm(base, number)
        print(f"The logarithm of {number} with base {base} is {logarithm}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base: Enter the number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpw7bx9a3h.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpw7bx9a3h.py", line 21, in main
    number = float(input("Enter the number: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
