## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out the corresponding letter grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The program should also handle cases where the input is not a valid grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to determine the letter grade
def determine_grade(grade):
    if not isinstance(grade, (int, float)) or grade < 0 or grade > 100:
        return "Invalid grade"
    elif grade >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Define a main function to test the determine_grade function
def main():
    print(determine_grade(55))  # Should print "F"
    print(determine_grade(90))  # Should print "A"
    print(determine_grade(80))  # Should print "B"
    print(determine_grade(70))  # Should print "C"
    print(determine_grade(60))  # Should print "D"
    print(determine_grade(-1))  # Should print "Invalid grade"
    print(determine_grade("A"))  # Should print "Invalid grade"

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
F
A
B
C
D
Invalid grade
Invalid grade
```
