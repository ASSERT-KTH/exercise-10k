## Exercise
Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. If the user inputs 'rock' and the computer chooses 'scissors', the user wins, and so on. Determine the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Return the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return "User wins!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nUser chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
User chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors

User wins!
