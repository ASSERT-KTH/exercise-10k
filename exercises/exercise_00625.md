## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the simple interest on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate the simple interest on a loan.

    Args:
        principal (float): The principal amount of the loan.
        rate (float): The interest rate of the loan.
        time (float): The time period of the loan in years.

    Returns:
        float: The simple interest on the loan.
    """
    # Convert the interest rate from percentage to decimal
    rate = rate / 100

    # Calculate the simple interest using the formula: simple_interest = principal * rate * time
    simple_interest = principal * rate * time

    return simple_interest


def main():
    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in %): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate the simple interest
    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)

    # Calculate the total amount
    total_amount = principal + simple_interest

    # Print the results
    print(f"Simple Interest: ${simple_interest:.2f}")
    print(f"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmply_medrr.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmply_medrr.py", line 24, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
