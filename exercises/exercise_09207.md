## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the tax amount based on the given income. If the income is less than or equal to 10000, the tax rate is 5%. If the income is between 10001 and 20000, the tax rate is 10%. If the income is greater than 20000, the tax rate is 15%. Use conditional statements to determine the tax rate.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the income amount from the user
income = float(input("Enter your income: "))

# Calculate the tax amount using conditional statements
if income <= 10000:
    tax = income * 0.05
elif 10001 <= income <= 20000:
    tax = income * 0.1
elif income > 20000:
    tax = income * 0.15

# Print the calculated tax amount
print("Your tax amount is:", tax)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: Your tax amount is: 1500.0
```
