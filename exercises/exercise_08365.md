## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their modular sum (i.e., the remainder when their sum is divided by 10).

## Reference Solution
```python
def modular_sum(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the modular sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The modular sum of a and b.
    """
    return (a + b) % 10


def main():
    # Example usage:
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    result = modular_sum(num1, num2)
    print(f"The modular sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpc6jls6h2.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpc6jls6h2.py", line 17, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '7 9'
```
