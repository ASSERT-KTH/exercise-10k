## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D plane.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Args:
        x1 (float): x-coordinate of the first point
        y1 (float): y-coordinate of the first point
        x2 (float): x-coordinate of the second point
        y2 (float): y-coordinate of the second point

    Returns:
        float: distance between the two points
    """
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)

def main():
    # Example usage
    x1, y1 = 1, 2
    x2, y2 = 4, 6
    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print(f"The distance between ({x1}, {y1}) and ({x2}, {y2}) is {distance:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) is 5.00
```
