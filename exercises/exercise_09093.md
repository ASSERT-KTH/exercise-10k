## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer score as input and outputs a grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

score = int(input("Enter a score: "))
print(grade(score))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a score: B
```
