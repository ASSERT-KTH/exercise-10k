## Exercise
Develop a program that counts the number of characters in a string using if/else statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_characters(input_string):
    """
    Counts the number of characters in a string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string to be counted.

    Returns:
        int: The number of characters in the string.
    """
    count = 0
    for char in input_string:
        if char:  # Check if the character is not empty
            count += 1  # Increment the count if the character is not empty
        else:
            pass  # Do nothing if the character is empty
    return count

def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    character_count = count_characters(input_string)
    print(f"The number of characters in the string is: {character_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: The number of characters in the string is: 5
```
