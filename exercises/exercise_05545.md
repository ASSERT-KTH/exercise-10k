## Exercise
Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a + b
        i += 1

# Print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
print_fibonacci(10)
```

## Generated Output
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
