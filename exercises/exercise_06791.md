## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to iterate through an array of numbers and calculate the sum of the squares of each number. The program should then print out the sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int sum = 0;

        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number * number;
        }

        System.out.println("The sum of the squares of the numbers is: " + sum);
    }
}
```
