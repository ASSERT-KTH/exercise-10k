## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate. The program should use the formula tax = income * rate to calculate the tax.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income, rate):
    """
    Calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate.
    
    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate the tax for.
        rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.

    Returns:
        float: The tax owed.
    """
    # Check if the income and rate are valid
    if income < 0 or rate < 0 or rate > 1:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Income and rate must be non-negative and rate must be between 0 and 1.")

    # Calculate the tax using the formula tax = income * rate
    tax = income * rate

    return tax

def main():
    # Get the income and tax rate from the user
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 25 for 25%): "))

    # Convert the tax rate from a percentage to a decimal
    rate = rate / 100

    try:
        # Calculate the tax owed
        tax = calculate_tax(income, rate)

        # Print the tax owed
        print(f"Your tax owed is: ${tax:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpz2rniwwy.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpz2rniwwy.py", line 23, in main
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50000 0.25'
```
