## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is odd. Use a for loop or a while loop to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the start and end of the range
start = 1
end = 10

# Use a for loop to iterate over the range
for num in range(start, end + 1):
    # Check if the number is odd
    if num % 2 != 0:
        # Print the odd number
        print(num)
```

```python
# Define the start and end of the range
start = 1
end = 10

# Initialize the current number
num = start

# Use a while loop to iterate over the range
while num <= end:
    # Check if the number is odd
    if num % 2 != 0:
        # Print the odd number
        print(num)
    # Increment the current number
    num += 1
```
