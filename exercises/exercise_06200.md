## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains only uppercase characters, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_uppercase(s):
    """
    This function checks if a given string contains only uppercase characters.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string to be checked.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the string contains only uppercase characters, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string.")

    # We use the built-in isupper() method in Python, which returns True if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, otherwise False.
    # However, this method also returns False for strings that contain non-alphabet characters or are empty. So, we need to handle these cases separately.
    # For an empty string, we return False because it does not contain any uppercase characters.
    if len(s) == 0:
        return False

    # Now, we can use the isupper() method to check if the string contains only uppercase characters.
    # If the string is uppercase, the isupper() method will return True; otherwise, it will return False.
    return s.isupper()
```
