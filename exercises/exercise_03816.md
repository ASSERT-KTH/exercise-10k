## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a password until they enter a valid one.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validates a password based on the following rules:
    - The password should be at least 8 characters long.
    - The password should have at least one uppercase letter.
    - The password should have at least one lowercase letter.
    - The password should have at least one digit.
    - The password should have at least one special character.
    """
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False, "Password should be at least 8 characters long."
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        return False, "Password should have at least one uppercase letter."
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        return False, "Password should have at least one lowercase letter."
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        return False, "Password should have at least one digit."
    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):
        return False, "Password should have at least one special character."
    return True, "Password is valid."

def main():
    while True:
        password = input("Enter a password: ")
        is_valid, message = validate_password(password)
        print(message)
        if is_valid:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password should have at least one uppercase letter.
Enter a password: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcyqji4ad.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcyqji4ad.py", line 24, in main
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
