## Exercise
Create a program that repeats back every line of input it receives, using a while loop, until it receives a blank line.

## Reference Solution
```python
def echo_lines():
    """
    Repeats back every line of input it receives until it receives a blank line.
    """
    while True:
        line = input()
        if line.strip() == "":
            break
        print(line)

def main():
    print("Enter lines of text. Type a blank line to exit.")
    echo_lines()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter lines of text. Type a blank line to exit.
