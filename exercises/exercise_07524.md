## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in three subjects: math, science, and english. The program should define a function to calculate the average score and another function to determine the grade based on the average score. The grade should be determined as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the average score
def average(score1, score2, score3):
    avg = (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3
    return avg

# Define a function to calculate the grade based on the average score
def grade(avg):
    # Check the average score and return the corresponding grade
    if avg >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif avg >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif avg >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif avg >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

# Define the main function
def main():
    # Prompt the user to enter their scores
    score1 = float(input("Enter your math score: "))
    score2 = float(input("Enter your science score: "))
    score3 = float(input("Enter your english score: "))

    # Calculate the average score
    avg = average(score1, score2, score3)

    # Calculate the grade based on the average score
    grade1 = grade(avg)

    # Print the average score and grade
    print("Your average score is: {:.2f}".format(avg))
    print("Your grade is: {}".format(grade1))

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your math score: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp3b5cm5be.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp3b5cm5be.py", line 23, in main
    score1 = float(input("Enter your math score: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '75 80 90'
```
