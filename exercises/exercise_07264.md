## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# variable declaration
score = 0

# input
score = float(input("Enter your score: "))

# conditional statements
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    print("C")
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: B
```
