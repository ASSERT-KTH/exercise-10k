## Exercise
Write a program that takes a person's age as input and classifies them as a child, teenager, adult, or senior. Use if/else statements to determine the classification.

## Reference Solution
```python
print("Welcome to the Age Classifier")

age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

if age <= 12:
    print("You are a child")
elif age <= 19:
    print("You are a teenager")
elif age <= 60:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a senior")

print("Thank you for using the Age Classifier")
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Age Classifier
Please enter your age: You are an adult
Thank you for using the Age Classifier
```
