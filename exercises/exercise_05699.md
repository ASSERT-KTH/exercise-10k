## Exercise
Create a program that takes a username as input and checks if it's valid using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_username(username):
    """
    Validate a username using the following rules:
    - The username should be at least 3 characters long.
    - The username should not be longer than 15 characters.
    - The username should only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    - The username should not start with a number.

    Args:
        username (str): The username to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the username is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the username is at least 3 characters long
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Username should be at least 3 characters long.")
        return False

    # Check if the username is not longer than 15 characters
    if len(username) > 15:
        print("Username should not be longer than 15 characters.")
        return False

    # Check if the username only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores
    if not username.isalnum() and '_' not in username:
        print("Username should only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.")
        return False

    # Check if the username starts with a number
    if username[0].isdigit():
        print("Username should not start with a number.")
        return False

    # If all checks pass, the username is valid
    print("Username is valid.")
    return True


def main():
    username = input("Enter a username: ")
    validate_username(username)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a username: Username is valid.
```
