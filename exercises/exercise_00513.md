    return target_element in list_to_check

def main():
    # Example usage
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    target = 3
    result = check_element(my_list, target)

    if result:
        print(f"The element {target} is present in the list.")
    else:
        print(f"The element {target} is not present in the list.")
