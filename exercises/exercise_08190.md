## Exercise
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])

    return fib_sequence

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)
    print("Fibonacci Sequence:")
    print(fib_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms: Fibonacci Sequence:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
