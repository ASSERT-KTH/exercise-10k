## Exercise
Understand how data type coercion works by performing arithmetic operations on strings and numbers, then printing the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Performing arithmetic operations on strings and integers
print("5" + "3")  # Output: "53"
print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8

# Printing the results
print("5" + "3")  # Output: "53"
print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8
```

## Generated Output
```
53
8
53
8
```
