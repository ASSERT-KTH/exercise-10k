## Exercise
Write a program that takes the distance and time as input and returns the speed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_speed(distance, time):
    """
    Calculate the speed of an object.

    Args:
        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object in meters.
        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.
    """
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero")
    speed = distance / time
    return speed

def main():
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance in meters: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))

    try:
        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)
        print(f"The speed is {speed} meters per second")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance in meters: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpflco7l8i.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpflco7l8i.py", line 18, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance in meters: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 2'
```
