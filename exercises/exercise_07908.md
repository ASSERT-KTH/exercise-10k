## Exercise
Write a function that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps. The function should take two parameters: the array and the number of steps. The function should return the rotated array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(array, steps):
    """
    Rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps.

    Parameters:
    array (list): The input array.
    steps (int): The number of steps to rotate the array.

    Returns:
    list: The rotated array.
    """

    # Check if the array is empty
    if len(array) == 0:
        return array

    # We first need to handle the case where the number of steps is greater than the length of the array.
    # We can do this by taking the modulus of the number of steps with the length of the array.
    # This is because after len(array) steps, the array will be the same as the original array.
    steps = steps % len(array)
    
    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to rotate the array.
    # We split the array into two parts: the last 'steps' elements and the rest of the array.
    # We then concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated array.
    # The '-steps:' slice means "get all elements from the end of the array back to 'steps' elements from the end".
    # The ':steps' slice means "get all elements from the start of the array up to but not including the 'steps'th element".
    rotated_array = array[-steps:] + array[:len(array)-steps]
    
    # Finally, we return the rotated array.
    return rotated_array

# Example usage:
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
steps = 2
print(rotate_array(array, steps))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
