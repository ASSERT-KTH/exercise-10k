## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a variable
x = 10

# Perform operations on the variable
print("Initial value of x:", x)

# Addition
x += 5
print("Value of x after addition:", x)

# Subtraction
x -= 3
print("Value of x after subtraction:", x)

# Multiplication
x *= 2
print("Value of x after multiplication:", x)

# Division
x /= 2
print("Value of x after division:", x)
```

## Generated Output
```
Initial value of x: 10
Value of x after addition: 15
Value of x after subtraction: 12
Value of x after multiplication: 24
Value of x after division: 12.0
