## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random name from a list of first and last names. The program should ask the user for the number of names to generate and then print the generated names.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the random module
import random

# Lists of first and last names
first_names = ["John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice", "Mike", "Emily", "Tom", "Lily", "David", "Sarah"]
last_names = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Jones", "Brown", "Davis", "Miller", "Wilson", "Moore", "Taylor"]

def generate_random_name():
    """
    Generates a random name by selecting a random first name and last name.
    """
    first_name = random.choice(first_names)
    last_name = random.choice(last_names)
    return f"{first_name} {last_name}"

def main():
    # Ask the user for the number of names to generate
    num_names = int(input("Enter the number of names to generate: "))

    # Generate and print the random names
    for i in range(num_names):
        print(generate_random_name())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
Enter the number of names to generate: 5
John Smith
Emily Johnson
Tom Williams
Sarah Brown
Mike Davis
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of names to generate: Emily Brown
Bob Johnson
David Williams
Jane Davis
Sarah Johnson
```
