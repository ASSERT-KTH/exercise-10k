## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function that takes two arguments, num1 and num2
def arithmetic(num1, num2):
    # Perform arithmetic operations
    addition = num1 + num2
    subtraction = num1 - num2
    multiplication = num1 * num2
    division = num1 / num2

    # Print the results
    print("Addition:", addition)
    print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
    print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
    print("Division:", division)

# Call the function with two arguments
arithmetic(5, 3)
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 8
Subtraction: 2
Multiplication: 15
Division: 1.6666666666666667
```
