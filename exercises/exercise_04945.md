## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    """Plays a game of rock, paper, scissors"""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.")

    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose rock, computer chose scissors.
