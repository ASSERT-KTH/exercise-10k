## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a binary operation as input, and returns the result of applying the binary operation to all elements in the list, accumulating the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fold_left(op, l):
    r = l[0]
    for element in l[1:]:
        r = op(r, element)
    return r

def mul(x, y):
    return x * y

print(fold_left(mul, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

## Generated Output
```
