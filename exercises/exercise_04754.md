## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second

## Reference Solution
```python
def power(base, exponent):
    """
    Raises the base to the power of the exponent.

    Args:
        base (float): The base number.
        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the exponentiation.
    """
    return base ** exponent

def main():
    # Get user input
    base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
    exponent = float(input("Enter the exponent: "))

    # Calculate and print the result
    result = power(base, exponent)
    print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmou9b4__.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmou9b4__.py", line 16, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
