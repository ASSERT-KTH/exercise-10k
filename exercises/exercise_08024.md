## Exercise
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA' is 'BCBA'. Write a function to solve this problem using dynamic programming.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):
    """
    Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.
    
    Parameters:
    seq1 (str): The first sequence.
    seq2 (str): The second sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.
    str: The longest common subsequence.
    """
    m, n = len(seq1), len(seq2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and column to 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp table in a bottom-up manner
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence
    lcs = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(seq1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    
    # Return the length and the longest common subsequence
    return dp[m][n], "".join(reversed(lcs))


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    seq1 = "ABCBDAB"
    seq2 = "BDCABA"
    length, lcs = longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2)
    print("Length of the longest common subsequence:", length)
    print("Longest common subsequence:", lcs)
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of the longest common subsequence: 4
Longest common subsequence: BDAB
```
