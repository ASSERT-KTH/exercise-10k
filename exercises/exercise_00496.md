## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and an initial value as input, and returns the accumulated value after applying a binary operation to all elements in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fold_left_binary_operation(list1, initial):
    result = initial
    for element in list1:
        result = result + element
    return result

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
initial = 0
result = fold_left_binary_operation(list1, initial)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
