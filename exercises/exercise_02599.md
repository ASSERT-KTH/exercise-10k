## Exercise
Write a program to find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of string t.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search in.
    t (str): The string containing the characters to search for.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring that contains all characters of string t. If no such substring exists, returns an empty string.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a counter for the characters in string t
    t_count = Counter(t)

    # Initialize the required character count
    required_chars = len(t_count)

    # Initialize the left and right pointers of the sliding window
    left = 0

    # Initialize the minimum window substring and its length
    min_window_substring = ""
    min_window_length = float('inf')

    # Initialize the formed character count
    formed_chars = 0

    # Create a counter for the characters in the current window
    window_counts = {}

    # Iterate over the string s
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add the character at the right pointer to the window counter
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        # If the character is in t and its count in the window is equal to its count in t, increment the formed character count
        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed_chars += 1

        # While the window contains all characters of string t and the left pointer is less than the right pointer
        while left <= right and formed_chars == required_chars:
            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_window_length:
                min_window_length = right - left + 1
                min_window_substring = s[left:right + 1]

            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counter
            character = s[left]
            window_counts[character] -= 1

            # If the character is in t and its count in the window is less than its count in t, decrement the formed character count
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed_chars -= 1

            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1

    # Return the minimum window substring
    return min_window_substring


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
    t = "ABC"
    print(min_window(s, t))
```
