## Exercise
Given a list of integers, write a program to access and print the element at a specific index.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_element_at_index(lst, index):
    """
    Prints the element at a specific index in a list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list of integers.
        index (int): The index of the element to be printed.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        # Check if the index is within the bounds of the list
        if index < len(lst):
            # Access and print the element at the specified index
            print(f"The element at index {index} is: {lst[index]}")
        else:
            print("Index out of range.")
    except TypeError:
        print("Invalid input type. Please ensure that the list is a list and the index is an integer.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


# Example usage
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
index_to_access = 2

print_element_at_index(numbers, index_to_access)
```

## Generated Output
```
The element at index 2 is: 30
```
