## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate simple interest.

    Args:
    - principal (float): The initial amount of money borrowed or invested.
    - annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.
    - years (int): The number of years the money is borrowed or invested for.

    Returns:
    - float: The simple interest.
    """
    simple_interest = principal * annual_interest_rate * years
    return simple_interest

def main():
    # Get user input
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    annual_interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%): "))
    annual_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 100  # Convert to decimal
    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    # Calculate and display the simple interest
    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)
    print(f"The simple interest is: ${simple_interest:.2f}")

    # Calculate and display the total amount
    total_amount = principal + simple_interest
    print(f"The total amount is: ${total_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd142i2sp.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpd142i2sp.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
