## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the shipping cost based on the weight and distance of the package. If the weight is less than 1 kg and the distance is less than 100 km, the shipping cost is $5. If the weight is between 1 kg and 5 kg and the distance is between 100 km and 500 km, the shipping cost is $10. If the weight is above 5 kg or the distance is above 500 km, the shipping cost is $20.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight, distance):
    """
    Calculate the shipping cost based on the weight and distance of the package.

    Args:
    weight (float): The weight of the package in kg.
    distance (float): The distance to be shipped in km.

    Returns:
    float: The shipping cost.
    """
    if weight < 1 and distance < 100:
        # If the weight is less than 1 kg and the distance is less than 100 km, the shipping cost is $5.
        return 5
    elif 1 <= weight <= 5 and 100 <= distance <= 500:
        # If the weight is between 1 kg and 5 kg and the distance is between 100 km and 500 km, the shipping cost is $10.
        return 10
    else:
        # If the weight is above 5 kg or the distance is above 500 km, the shipping cost is $20.
        return 20

# Example usage
weight = 3  # kg
distance = 200  # km
shipping_cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight, distance)
print(f"The shipping cost for a package weighing {weight} kg and being shipped {distance} km is ${shipping_cost}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The shipping cost for a package weighing 3 kg and being shipped 200 km is $10.
```
