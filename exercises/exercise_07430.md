## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and repeat, with each repetition increasing by 1. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. If the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pattern(n):
    """
    Prints a pattern of numbers that starts with 1 and repeats, 
    with each repetition increasing by 1.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number that determines the pattern.
    """
    # Initialize variables
    i = 1
    
    # Loop to print the increasing part of the pattern
    while i <= n:
        print(i, end=', ')  # Print the current number
        i += 1  # Increment the counter
    
    # Reset the counter for the decreasing part of the pattern
    i = n - 1
    
    # Loop to print the decreasing part of the pattern
    while i >= 1:
        print(i, end=', ')  # Print the current number
        i -= 1  # Decrement the counter

# Test the function
print_pattern(5)
```

## Generated Output
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
```
