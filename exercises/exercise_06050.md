## Exercise
Write a program that takes in the current weather conditions and provides a forecast using conditional statements, considering factors such as temperature and humidity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):
    """
    Provides a weather forecast based on the current temperature and humidity.

    Args:
    temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
    humidity (float): The current humidity as a percentage.

    Returns:
    str: A string representing the weather forecast.
    """
    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:
        return "It's going to be a hot and humid day. Expect thunderstorms in the evening."
    elif temperature > 25 and humidity < 60:
        return "It's going to be a hot day. Expect clear skies and sunshine."
    elif temperature < 15 and humidity > 80:
        return "It's going to be a cold and rainy day. Expect fog in the morning."
    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 80:
        return "It's going to be a cold day. Expect clear skies and sunshine."
    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25 and humidity > 60:
        return "It's going to be a mild and humid day. Expect light rain showers."
    else:
        return "It's going to be a mild day. Expect clear skies and sunshine."

# Test the function
temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
humidity = float(input("Enter the current humidity as a percentage: "))

forecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)
print(f"The weather forecast is: {forecast}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_nes44w5.py", line 26, in <module>
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'sunny 75 60'
```
