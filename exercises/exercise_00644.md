## Exercise
Create a program that reads a user's first and last name and prints out a greeting message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_name():
    """Gets the user's first and last name."""
    first_name = input("Please enter your first name: ")
    last_name = input("Please enter your last name: ")
    return first_name, last_name

def print_greeting(first_name, last_name):
    """Prints a greeting message with the user's name."""
    print(f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}! It's nice to meet you.")

def main():
    first_name, last_name = get_user_name()
    print_greeting(first_name, last_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
