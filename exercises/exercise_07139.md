## Exercise
Create a function called "calculate_stats" that takes a list of exam scores as input and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the scores. The function should handle cases where the input list is empty.

## Reference Solution
```python
import statistics

def calculate_stats(scores):
    """
    This function calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of exam scores.

    Args:
        scores (list): A list of exam scores.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the scores.
    """

    # First, we check if the input list is empty
    if not scores:
        # If the list is empty, we return a dictionary with all stats set to None
        return {
            'mean': None,
            'median': None,
            'standard_deviation': None
        }

    # Next, we calculate the mean of the scores
    # We use the statistics module's mean function for this
    mean = statistics.mean(scores)

    # Then, we calculate the median of the scores
    # We use the statistics module's median function for this
    median = statistics.median(scores)

    # Finally, we calculate the standard deviation of the scores
    # We use the statistics module's stdev function for this
    # This function will raise a StatisticsError if the list has less than 2 elements
    # So, we need to handle this case
    if len(scores) < 2:
        std_dev = None
    else:
        std_dev = statistics.stdev(scores)

    # Now, we create a dictionary to store our results
    stats = {
        # The mean of the scores
        'mean': mean,
        # The median of the scores
        'median': median,
        # The standard deviation of the scores
        'standard_deviation': std_dev
    }

    # Finally, we return the dictionary
    return stats
```
