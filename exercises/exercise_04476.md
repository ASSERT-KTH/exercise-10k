## Exercise
Write a program to print the first N numbers in a specific sequence using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_sequence(n, d=1, start=1):
    """
    Prints the first n numbers in an arithmetic sequence.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of terms to print.
    d (int, optional): The common difference between terms. Defaults to 1.
    start (int, optional): The starting term. Defaults to 1.
    """
    for i in range(n):
        term = start + (i * d)
        print(term)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms (n): "))
    d = int(input("Enter the common difference (d), default is 1: ") or 1)
    start = int(input("Enter the starting term, default is 1: ") or 1)
    print_sequence(n, d, start)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms (n): Enter the common difference (d), default is 1: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxy1ninws.py", line 17, in <module>
    d = int(input("Enter the common difference (d), default is 1: ") or 1)
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
