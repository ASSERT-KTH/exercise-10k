## Exercise
Create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns the first element.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_first_element(input_tuple):
    """
    This function takes a tuple as input and returns the first element.

    Args:
        input_tuple (tuple): The input tuple from which the first element will be extracted.

    Returns:
        any: The first element of the input tuple.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is indeed a tuple
    if not isinstance(input_tuple, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a tuple")

    # Then, we need to check if the tuple is not empty
    if len(input_tuple) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple cannot be empty")

    # Now, we can return the first element of the tuple
    # In Python, tuples are 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0
    return input_tuple[0]
```
