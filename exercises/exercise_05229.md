## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's age and grade level as input, and prints 'Eligible' if the student is eligible to participate in a program (ages 13-19, grades 7-12), and 'Not Eligible' otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
grade = int(input("Enter grade: "))

if age >= 13 and age <= 19 and grade >= 7 and grade <= 12:
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not Eligible")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpl3jr99be.py", line 1, in <module>
    age = int(input("Enter age: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '15 10'
```
