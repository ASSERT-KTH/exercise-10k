## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a new dictionary with the students' names as keys and their grades as values, but only include students with grades above 80.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_students(grades_dict):
    """
    This function filters a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades.
    It returns a new dictionary with only the students who have grades above 80.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with students who have grades above 80.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students
    filtered_students = {}

    # Iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary
    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():
        
        # Check if the student's grade is above 80
        if grade > 80:
            
            # If the grade is above 80, add the student to the filtered dictionary
            filtered_students[student] = grade

    # Return the filtered dictionary
    return filtered_students


# Example usage:
grades = {
    "John": 90,
    "Alice": 70,
    "Bob": 85,
    "Charlie": 95
}

filtered_grades = filter_students(grades)
print(filtered_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90, 'Bob': 85, 'Charlie': 95}
```
