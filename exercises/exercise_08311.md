## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and checks if the student has passed or failed. The passing grade is 50. If the student's grade is 50 or above, the program should print 'Passed'. Otherwise, it should print 'Failed'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: To determine whether a student has passed or failed a course

# Define a function to check if a student has passed or failed
def student_passed_or_failed():
    # Ask the user for the student's grade
    grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade: "))

    # Check if the grade is 50 or above
    if grade >= 50:
        # Print a message indicating that the student has passed
        print("Passed")
    else:
        # Print a message indicating that the student has failed
        print("Failed")

# Call the function to start the program
student_passed_or_failed()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's grade: Passed
```
