## Exercise
Create a function that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. The function should generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then ask the user for their choice. The function should then determine the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    """
    This function plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. It generates a random choice 
    (rock, paper, or scissors) and then asks the user for their choice. The function 
    then determines the winner based on the game's rules.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # First, we define the possible choices in a list
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

    # We generate a random choice from the list of possible choices
    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

    # We ask the user for their choice
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()

    # We check if the user's choice is valid
    while user_choice not in choices:
        # If the user's choice is not valid, we ask them to try again
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    # We print out the user's choice and the computer's choice
    print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\n")

    # We determine the winner based on the game's rules
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        # If the user's choice and the computer's choice are the same, it's a tie
        print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
    elif user_choice == 'rock':
        # If the user chose rock, they win if the computer chose scissors
        if computer_choice == 'scissors':
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
        # If the user chose rock, they lose if the computer chose paper
        else:
            print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user_choice == 'paper':
        # If the user chose paper, they win if the computer chose rock
        if computer_choice == 'rock':
            print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
        # If the user chose paper, they lose if the computer chose scissors
        else:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user_choice == 'scissors':
        # If the user chose scissors, they win if the computer chose paper
        if computer_choice == 'paper':
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
        # If the user chose scissors, they lose if the computer chose rock
        else:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")

# We call the function to play the game
play_rock_paper_scissors()
```

## Generated Output
