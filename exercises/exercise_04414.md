## Exercise
Create a program that counts the number of consecutive occurrences of a target element in a list using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_consecutive(target, lst):
    """
    Counts the number of consecutive occurrences of a target element in a list.

    Args:
        target (any): The target element to count.
        lst (list): The list to search for the target element.

    Returns:
        int: The number of consecutive occurrences of the target element.
    """
    count = 0
    index = 0
    while index < len(lst):
        if lst[index] == target:
            count += 1
            index += 1
        else:
            if count > 0:
                yield count
            count = 0
            index += 1
    if count > 0:
        yield count

def main():
    lst = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    target = 3
    print(f"Consecutive occurrences of {target}:")
    for i, count in enumerate(count_consecutive(target, lst)):
        print(f"Sequence {i+1}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Consecutive occurrences of 3:
Sequence 1: 4
```
