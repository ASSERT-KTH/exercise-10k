## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input. The program should be able to identify strings, integers, and floats. If the input cannot be classified as one of these types, the program should output an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
x = input()

try:
    x = int(x)
    print(f"The data type of the input is integer and the value is {x}.")
except ValueError:
    try:
        x = float(x)
        print(f"The data type of the input is float and the value is {x}.")
    except ValueError:
        print(f"The data type of the input is string and the value is {x}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The data type of the input is integer and the value is 123.
```
