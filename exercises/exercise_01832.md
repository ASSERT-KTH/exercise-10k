## Exercise
Write a program to find the common elements between two given arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Returns the common elements between two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The common elements between the two arrays.
    """
    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))

def main():
    # Example usage:
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    common = common_elements(arr1, arr2)
    print("Common elements:", common)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
