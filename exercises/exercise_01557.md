## Exercise
Write a function to combine two lists of integers into a list of pairs, where each pair contains one element from each list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function combines two lists of integers into a list of pairs.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list of integers.
        list2 (list): The second list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of pairs, where each pair contains one element from each list.
    """

    # We will use the built-in zip function in Python, which makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
    # The zip function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
    zipped_list = zip(list1, list2)
    
    # We convert the zipped list into a list of pairs. Each pair is a tuple.
    # The list function is used to convert the zip object into a list.
    list_of_pairs = list(zipped_list)
    
    # Finally, we return the list of pairs.
    return list_of_pairs

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
print(combine_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```

## Generated Output
```
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```
