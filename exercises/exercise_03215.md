## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their least common multiple (LCM).

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.
    """
    # Calculate the LCM using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)
    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // math.gcd(num1, num2)
    return lcm

def main():
    # Get two numbers from the user
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the LCM
    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppg00vzxu.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmppg00vzxu.py", line 20, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 18'
```
