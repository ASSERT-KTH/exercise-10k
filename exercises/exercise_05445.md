## Exercise
Write a program that takes a name, age, and favorite color as input and prints out a personalized story

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for name, age, and favorite color"""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    favorite_color = input("Please enter your favorite color: ")
    return name, age, favorite_color

def generate_story(name, age, favorite_color):
    """Generate a personalized story based on user input"""
    story = f"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a {age} year old named {name}. "
    story += f"{name} loved to wear {favorite_color} clothes and accessories, and their favorite hobby was exploring the outdoors. "
    story += f"One day, while on an adventure, {name} stumbled upon a hidden {favorite_color} cave. "
    story += f"As they entered the cave, they discovered a treasure trove of {favorite_color} gems and jewels. "
    story += f"{name} was overjoyed and decided to use their newfound treasure to build a {favorite_color} castle, where they lived happily ever after."
    return story

def main():
    """Main function to run the program"""
    name, age, favorite_color = get_user_input()
    story = generate_story(name, age, favorite_color)
    print("\nHere is your personalized story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
