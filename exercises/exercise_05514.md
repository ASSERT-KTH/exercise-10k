## Exercise
Write a program to check if a graph is connected using depth-first search.

## Reference Solution
```python
from typing import Dict, List

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, num_vertices: int):
        self.num_vertices = num_vertices
        self.adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(num_vertices)}

    def add_edge(self, u: int, v: int):
        """Add an edge between vertices u and v."""
        self.adj_list[u].append(v)
        self.adj_list[v].append(u)

    def dfs(self, vertex: int, visited: List[bool]) -> None:
        """Perform DFS traversal from the given vertex."""
        visited[vertex] = True
        for neighbor in self.adj_list[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                self.dfs(neighbor, visited)

    def is_connected(self) -> bool:
        """Check if the graph is connected."""
        visited = [False] * self.num_vertices
        self.dfs(0, visited)
        return all(visited)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a graph with 5 vertices
    graph = Graph(5)

    # Add edges to the graph
    graph.add_edge(0, 1)
    graph.add_edge(1, 2)
    graph.add_edge(2, 3)
    graph.add_edge(3, 4)

    # Check if the graph is connected
    if graph.is_connected():
        print("The graph is connected.")
    else:
        print("The graph is not connected.")

    # Create another graph with 5 vertices
    graph_disconnected = Graph(5)

    # Add edges to the graph
    graph_disconnected.add_edge(0, 1)
    graph_disconnected.add_edge(1, 2)
    graph_disconnected.add_edge(3, 4)

    # Check if the graph is connected
    if graph_disconnected.is_connected():
        print("The graph is connected.")
    else:
        print("The graph is not connected.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The graph is connected.
The graph is not connected.
```
