## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.

    Args:
        base (float): The base of the triangle.
        height (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    if base < 0 or height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Base and height must be non-negative")
    area = (base * height) / 2
    return area

def main():
    # Example usage
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
    print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base of the triangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpo2283gv1.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpo2283gv1.py", line 19, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '4 5'
```
