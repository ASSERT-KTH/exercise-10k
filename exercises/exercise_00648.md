## Exercise
Create a program that reads a line of input from the user and prints it out a specified number of times.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_line_n_times():
    """
    Reads a line of input from the user and prints it out a specified number of times.
    """
    # Read a line of input from the user
    user_input = input("Please enter a line of text: ")

    # Ask the user how many times to print the line
    while True:
        try:
            num_times = int(input("How many times would you like to print the line? "))
            if num_times <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive integer.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")

    # Print the line the specified number of times
    for _ in range(num_times):
        print(user_input)

# Call the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_line_n_times()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a line of text: How many times would you like to print the line?
