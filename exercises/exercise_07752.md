## Exercise
Create a function called 'calculate_grade' that takes in a student's score as a percentage and returns a letter grade based on the following scale: A (90-100%), B (80-89%), C (70-79%), D (60-69%), F (below 60%). The function should also handle cases where the input is not a valid percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the letter grade based on the given score as a percentage.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score as a percentage.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding letter grade or an error message if the input is not a valid percentage.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is not a number or is less than 0 or greater than 100
    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)) or score < 0 or score > 100:
        # If it's not a valid percentage, we return an error message
        return "Error: Invalid percentage. Please enter a number between 0 and 100."

    # Now, we start checking the grade based on the given scale
    # We check if the score is 90 or above for an A grade
    if score >= 90:
        # If it's 90 or above, we return 'A'
        return 'A'

    # If it's not an A, we check if it's 80 or above for a B grade
    elif score >= 80:
        # If it's 80 or above, we return 'B'
        return 'B'

    # If it's not a B, we check if it's 70 or above for a C grade
    elif score >= 70:
        # If it's 70 or above, we return 'C'
        return 'C'

    # If it's not a C, we check if it's 60 or above for a D grade
    elif score >= 60:
        # If it's 60 or above, we return 'D'
        return 'D'

    # If it's none of the above, it must be below 60, so we return 'F'
    else:
        # We return 'F' for scores below 60
        return 'F'
