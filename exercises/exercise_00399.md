## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height):
    """
    Calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.
        height (float): The height of the cylinder.

    Returns:
        float: The surface area of the cylinder.
    """
    if radius < 0 or height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius and height must be non-negative")

    surface_area = 2 * math.pi * (radius ** 2) + 2 * math.pi * radius * height
    return surface_area

def main():
    # Example usage:
    radius = 5.0  # cm
    height = 10.0  # cm

    surface_area = calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height)
    print(f"The surface area of the cylinder is {surface_area:.2f} square cm")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The surface area of the cylinder is 471.24 square cm
```
