## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the average of the numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate average of an empty list")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Get the list of numbers from the user
    user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")

    # Convert the input to a list of floats
    try:
        numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split()]
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.")
        return

    # Calculate and print the average
    try:
        average = calculate_average(numbers)
        print("The average is:", average)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: Invalid input. Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.
```
