## Exercise
Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and prints the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Description: A simple arithmetic calculator program

# Input
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Addition
addition = num1 + num2
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = num1 - num2
print("The difference between", num1, "and", num2, "is", subtraction)

# Multiplication
multiplication = num1 * num2
print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is", multiplication)

# Division
if num2 != 0:
    division = num1 / num2
    print("The quotient of", num1, "divided by", num2, "is", division)
else:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcn781daf.py", line 6, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5, 3'
```
