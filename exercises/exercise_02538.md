## Exercise
Write a program to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person

## Reference Solution
```python
def activity_selection(activities):
    """
    Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person.

    Args:
    activities (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end time of an activity.

    Returns:
    list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end time of a selected activity.
    """
    # Sort the activities by their end times
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Initialize the result with the first activity
    result = [activities[0]]

    # Iterate over the remaining activities
    for start, end in activities[1:]:
        # If the current activity starts after the last selected activity ends, add it to the result
        if start >= result[-1][1]:
            result.append((start, end))

    return result

# Example usage
activities = [(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (3, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (2, 13), (12, 14)]
selected_activities = activity_selection(activities)

print("Selected Activities:")
for start, end in selected_activities:
    print(f"Start: {start}, End: {end}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Selected Activities:
Start: 1, End: 4
Start: 5, End: 7
Start: 8, End: 11
Start: 12, End: 14
```
