## Exercise
Develop a program that takes in an array of integers and prints out the numbers that are odd or even. Use if/else statements to check each number and assign it to the corresponding list

## Reference Solution
```python
def classify_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Classify numbers as odd or even and print out the corresponding numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    odd_numbers = []
    even_numbers = []

    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the remainder of num divided by 2 is 0, it's even
            even_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            # Otherwise, it's odd
            odd_numbers.append(num)

    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
    print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    classify_numbers(numbers)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
