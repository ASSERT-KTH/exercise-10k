## Exercise
Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'


def main():
    # Test the function
    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]
    for score in scores:
        print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {calculate_grade(score)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Score: 95, Grade: A
Score: 85, Grade: B
Score: 75, Grade: C
Score: 65, Grade: D
Score: 55, Grade: F
```
