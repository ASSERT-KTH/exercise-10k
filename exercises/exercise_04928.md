## Exercise
Write a program that converts a given amount of one currency to another given the exchange rate. The program should use the formula converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate to calculate the converted amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate):
    """
    Converts a given amount of one currency to another given the exchange rate.

    Args:
        amount (float): The amount of currency to be converted.
        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate between the two currencies.

    Returns:
        float: The converted amount.
    """
    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate
    return converted_amount

def main():
    # Example usage
    amount = float(input("Enter the amount of currency to be converted: "))
    exchange_rate = float(input("Enter the exchange rate: "))
    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate)
    print(f"{amount} converted to the other currency is {converted_amount}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount of currency to be converted: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmptjm18yvn.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmptjm18yvn.py", line 17, in main
    amount = float(input("Enter the amount of currency to be converted: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 1.5'
```
