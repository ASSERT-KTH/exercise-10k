## Exercise
Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_greeting(name):
    """
    This function takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting.

    Args:
        name (str): The name to be used in the greeting.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(name, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string.")

    # Now, we create the greeting message. We use an f-string to insert the name into the message.
    # This is a more modern and readable way of formatting strings in Python.
    greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"

    # Finally, we print the greeting message.
    print(greeting)

# Example usage:
print_greeting("John")
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello, John!
```
