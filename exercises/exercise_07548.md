## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a given range using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, and the program should be able to handle cases where the start value is greater than the end value.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: Calculate the sum of all numbers in a given range

def calculate_sum(start, end):
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    sum = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        sum += i
    return sum

def calculate_sum_with_while(start, end):
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    sum = 0
    while start <= end:
        sum += start
        start += 1
    return sum

def main():
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
    end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))
    print("Sum using for loop:", calculate_sum(start, end))
    print("Sum using while loop:", calculate_sum_with_while(start, end))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the start of the range: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8z26wbg_.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp8z26wbg_.py", line 23, in main
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 5'
```
