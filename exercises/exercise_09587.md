## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. The program should ask for the student's grade and then print 'Pass' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Fail' if it's below 50.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the student's grade
grade = float(input("Enter the grade: "))

# Determine the result
if grade >= 50:
    result = "Pass"
else:
    result = "Fail"

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the grade: Fail
```
