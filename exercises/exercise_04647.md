## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a person's BMI based on their weight and height. If the BMI is under 18.5, the person is underweight. If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the person is normal weight. If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the person is overweight. If the BMI is 30 or above, the person is obese.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    """
    Calculate BMI based on weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
    
    Args:
        weight (float): Weight in kg.
        height (float): Height in meters.
    
    Returns:
        float: Calculated BMI.
    """
    return weight / (height ** 2)


def determine_weight_category(bmi):
    """
    Determine weight category based on BMI.
    
    Args:
        bmi (float): Calculated BMI.
    
    Returns:
        str: Weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
    """
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
        return "normal weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
        return "overweight"
    else:
        return "obese"


def main():
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
    height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
    weight_category = determine_weight_category(bmi)

    print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
    print(f"Your weight category is: {weight_category}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpr6sojrav.py", line 36, in main
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
