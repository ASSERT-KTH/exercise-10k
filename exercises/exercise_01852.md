## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def diff(list1, list2):
    res = []
    for i in list1:
        if i not in list2:
            res.append(i)
    return res

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(diff(list1, list2))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
