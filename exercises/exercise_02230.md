## Exercise
Write a program that filters a list of numbers and returns only the numbers that meet a specified condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
    """
    Filters a list of numbers based on a specified condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if the number meets the condition, False otherwise.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers that meet the specified condition.
    """
    return [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_condition = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
odd_condition = lambda x: x % 2 != 0

even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, even_condition)
odd_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, odd_condition)

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
