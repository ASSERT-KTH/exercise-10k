## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message with their name. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message stating whether they are an adult or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

# User's Name (line 1)
name = input("What is your name? ")

# User's Age (lines 2-4)
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age)

# Greeting Message (lines 5-6)
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Adult or Not (lines 7-15)
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("You are not an adult!")
```

## Generated Output
```
What is your name? How old are you? Hello, John!
You are an adult!
```
