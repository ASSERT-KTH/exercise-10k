## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Main function
def main():
    # Get the student's score
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Validate the score
    while score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Calculate and display the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
