## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers and two indices as input, and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_list_between_indices(lst, start, end):
    """
    Returns a new list containing the elements between the start and end indices.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list of integers.
        start (int): The starting index (inclusive).
        end (int): The ending index (inclusive).

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the elements between the start and end indices.
    """
    return lst[start:end+1]

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
start = 2
end = 5
result = get_list_between_indices(lst, start, end)
print(result)  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[3, 4, 5, 6]
```
