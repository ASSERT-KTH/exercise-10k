## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared, using a lambda function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_numbers(num_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with each number squared.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a list. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(num_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Then, we use a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is squared.
    # We use a lambda function to square each number.
    # The lambda function is defined as lambda x: x**2, which means it takes one argument x and returns x squared.
    squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x**2, num_list))

    # Finally, we return the new list with the squared numbers.
    return squared_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(square_numbers(numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
