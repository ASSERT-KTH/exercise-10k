## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the original string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    if s == reversed_s:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test the function
s = "radar"
print(is_palindrome(s))

s = "python"
print(is_palindrome(s))
```

## Generated Output
```
True
False
```
