## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array, an old element, and a new element as input, and returns the array with all occurrences of the old element replaced by the new element.

## Reference Solution
```python
def replace(arr, old_element, new_element):
    new_arr = [new_element if x == old_element else x for x in arr]
    return new_arr

arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
old_element = 2
new_element = 5

new_arr = replace(arr, old_element, new_element)
print(arr)
print(new_arr)
```

```python
[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
[1, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
[1, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5]
```
