## Exercise
Create a function called math_operation that takes two numbers and an operation as input. The operation can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'. The function should then perform the specified mathematical operation on the two numbers and return the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def math_operation(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    This function performs a specified mathematical operation on two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operation (str): The mathematical operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the mathematical operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic mathematical operations.
        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.
    """

    # First, we check if the operation is valid
    if operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.")

    # Then, we perform the specified operation
    if operation == 'addition':
        # If the operation is addition, we simply add the two numbers
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        # If the operation is subtraction, we subtract the second number from the first
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        # If the operation is multiplication, we multiply the two numbers
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        # If the operation is division, we divide the first number by the second
        # We also check if the second number is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        result = num1 / num2

    # Finally, we return the result
    return result
```
