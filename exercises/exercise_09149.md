## Exercise
Create a string variable and access individual characters using indexing, then print out the characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
def access_string_characters():
    # Create a string variable
    my_string = "Hello, World!"

    # Access individual characters using indexing
    print("Accessing individual characters:")
    print(f"Character at index 0: {my_string[0]}")
    print(f"Character at index 1: {my_string[1]}")
    print(f"Last character: {my_string[-1]}")

    # Print out characters using a loop
    print("\nPrinting characters using a loop:")
    for i in range(len(my_string)):
        print(f"Character at index {i}: {my_string[i]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    access_string_characters()
```

## Generated Output
```
Accessing individual characters:
Character at index 0: H
Character at index 1: e
Last character: !

Printing characters using a loop:
Character at index 0: H
Character at index 1: e
Character at index 2: l
Character at index 3: l
Character at index 4: o
Character at index 5: ,
Character at index 6:  
Character at index 7: W
Character at index 8: o
Character at index 9: r
Character at index 10: l
Character at index 11: d
Character at index 12: !
```
