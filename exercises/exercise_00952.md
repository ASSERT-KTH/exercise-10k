## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the product of a list of numbers using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_product(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the product of a list of numbers using a while loop.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The product of the numbers in the list.
    """
    # Initialize the product to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Initialize the index to 0
    index = 0
    
    # Loop through the list of numbers
    while index < len(numbers):
        # Multiply the current product by the current number
        product *= numbers[index]
        
        # Move to the next number
        index += 1
    
    # Return the final product
    return product


# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_product(numbers)
print("The product of the numbers is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
The product of the numbers is: 120
```
