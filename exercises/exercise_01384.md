## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The program should give hints to the user if their guess is too high or too low.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made
    tries = 0
    
    # Initialize a flag to indicate whether the player has guessed the number
    guessed = False
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")
    
    while not guessed:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of tries the player has made
        tries += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.")
            guessed = True
        # Check if the user's guess is too high
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too high. Try a lower number.")
        # Check if the user's guess is too low
        else:
            print("Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.")

# Run the game
number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
Take a guess: Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.
Take a guess: Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.
Take a guess: Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.
Take a guess:
