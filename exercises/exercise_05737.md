## Exercise
Write a function that uses the map, filter, and reduce functions to process a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def process_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Process a list of numbers by squaring them, filtering out numbers less than 10, and summing the remaining numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to process.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the squared numbers greater than or equal to 10.
    """

    # Square all numbers in the list using map
    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
    
    # Filter out numbers less than 10 using filter
    filtered_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x >= 10, squared_numbers))
    
    # Calculate the sum of the remaining numbers using reduce
    sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, filtered_numbers, 0)

    return sum_of_numbers

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = process_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of squared numbers greater than or equal to 10:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squared numbers greater than or equal to 10: 41
```
