## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a given variable is a tuple.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_tuple(var):
    """
    This function checks if a given variable is a tuple.
    
    Args:
        var: The variable to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the variable is a tuple, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # We will use the isinstance() function in Python, which checks if an object (first argument) is an instance or subclass of a class (second argument).
    # The type of a tuple in Python is tuple, so we will use this as our second argument.
    return isinstance(var, tuple)

# Test the function
var1 = (1, 2, 3)  # This is a tuple
var2 = [1, 2, 3]  # This is a list
var3 = "Hello"    # This is a string

print(check_tuple(var1))  # Expected output: True
print(check_tuple(var2))  # Expected output: False
print(check_tuple(var3))  # Expected output: False
```

## Generated Output
```
True
False
False
```
