## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns their product

## Reference Solution
```python
def product_of_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the product of all numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The product of all numbers in the list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number

    return product

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = product_of_numbers(numbers)
    print(f"The product of {numbers} is {result}")
```

```python
import math

def product_of_numbers(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return math.prod(numbers)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = product_of_numbers(numbers)
    print(f"The product of {numbers} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The product of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 120
```
