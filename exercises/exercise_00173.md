## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate dynamic typing, where the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Dynamic Typing in Python

# Declare a variable with an initial integer value
var = 10
print("Initial Type:", type(var))

# Change the type to float
var = 10.5
print("Type after conversion to float:", type(var))

# Change the type to string
var = "Hello, World!"
print("Type after conversion to string:", type(var))

# Change the type to list
var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Type after conversion to list:", type(var))

# Change the type to dictionary
var = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print("Type after conversion to dictionary:", type(var))
```

## Generated Output
```
Initial Type: <class 'int'>
Type after conversion to float: <class 'float'>
Type after conversion to string: <class 'str'>
Type after conversion to list: <class 'list'>
Type after conversion to dictionary: <class 'dict'>
```
