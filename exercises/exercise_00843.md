## Exercise
Create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.
def compose_functions(func1, func2):
    """
    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.
    
    The composition of two functions f and g is defined as (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)). In other words, the output of the second function is passed as the input to the first function.

    Args:
        func1 (function): The first function in the composition.
        func2 (function): The second function in the composition.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.
    """

    # Define a new function that will be the composition of func1 and func2.
    def composite_function(*args, **kwargs):
        
        # First, call func2 with the given arguments and keyword arguments.
        result_from_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Then, call func1 with the result from func2 as its argument.
        result_from_func1 = func1(result_from_func2)
        
        # Return the result from func1.
        return result_from_func1
    
    # Return the composite function.
    return composite_function

# Example usage:
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Create a new function that is the composition of add_one and square.
composed = compose_functions(add_one, square)

print(composed(5))  # Output: 26
```

## Generated Output
```
26
```
