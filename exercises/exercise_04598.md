## Exercise
Write a function that takes a graph and two nodes as input and returns the shortest path between them

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    """
    Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

    Args:
    - graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is another dictionary.
                    The inner dictionary's keys are the neighboring nodes, and its values are the edge weights.
    - start (node): The starting node.
    - end (node): The ending node.

    Returns:
    - shortest_path (list): A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start to the end node.
    - shortest_distance (int): The total weight of the shortest path.
    """
    # Initialize distances and previous nodes in the shortest path
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}

    # Priority queue to store nodes to be processed
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        # Extract the node with the minimum distance
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # If the current node is the end node, we've found the shortest path
        if current_node == end:
            path = []
            while current_node is not None:
                path.append(current_node)
                current_node = previous_nodes[current_node]
            path.reverse()
            return path, current_distance

        # If the current distance is greater than the already known distance, skip this node
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Iterate over the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # If a shorter path to the neighbor is found, update its distance and previous node
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # If there's no path from the start to the end node, return None
    return None, None


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
    }

    start_node = 'A'
    end_node = 'D'

    path, distance = shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)
    if path is not None:
        print(f"Shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node}: {path}")
        print(f"Shortest distance: {distance}")
    else:
        print(f"No path from {start_node} to {end_node}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Shortest path from A to D: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
Shortest distance: 4
```
