## Exercise
Write a program to manage a bank account, including deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, initial_balance):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object.

        Args:
            account_number (str): The account number.
            initial_balance (float): The initial balance.
        """
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a certain amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the amount is negative.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount cannot be negative.")
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f} into account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a certain amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the amount is negative or exceeds the balance.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds.")
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f} from account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def get_balance(self):
        """
        Returns the current balance.

        Returns:
            float: The current balance.
        """
        return self.balance

    def __str__(self):

def main():
    account_number = input("Enter account number: ")
    initial_balance = float(input("Enter initial balance: "))

    account = BankAccount(account_number, initial_balance)

    while True:
        print("\n1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            try:
                account.withdraw(amount)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}")
        elif choice == "4":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter account number: Enter initial balance: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpdc3ded3e.py", line 89, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpdc3ded3e.py", line 60, in main
    initial_balance = float(input("Enter initial balance: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
