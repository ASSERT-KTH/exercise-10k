## Exercise
Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a given string

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_first_non_repeating_char(s):
    """
    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str or None: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    char_count = Counter(s)

    # Iterate over the characters in the original order
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character appears only once
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            # Return the first non-repeating character
            return char

    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None
    return None

# Example usage
print(find_first_non_repeating_char("aabbc"))  # Output: c
print(find_first_non_repeating_char("aabbcc"))  # Output: None
```

## Generated Output
```
c
None
```
