## Exercise
Create a program that takes two integers as input and performs all four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them. The program should then output the results of each operation, handling any potential division by zero errors.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user input
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2

# Perform division
if num2 == 0:
    division = "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
else:
    division = num1 / num2

# Print results
print("Addition: ", addition)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)
print("Division: ", division)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp1gr4gz5e.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 2'
```
