## Exercise
Create a program that takes two integers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Introduction
print("Welcome to the Calculator Program")
print("This program will take two integers as input and perform calculations based on the user's choice.")

# Getting Input
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Printing Options
print("Choose an operation:")
print("1. Addition")
print("2. Subtraction")
print("3. Multiplication")
print("4. Division")

# Getting User's Choice
choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): ")

# Performing Calculations
if choice == '1':
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
elif choice == '2':
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
elif choice == '3':
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
elif choice == '4':
    if num2 == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Calculator Program
This program will take two integers as input and perform calculations based on the user's choice.
Enter first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmplbyysvpc.py", line 6, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 2 addition'
