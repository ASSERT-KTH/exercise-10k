## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return abs(num1 - num2)


def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
        return

    # Calculate and print the difference
    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)
    print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: Invalid input. Please enter a number.
