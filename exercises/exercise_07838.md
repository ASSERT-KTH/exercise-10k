## Exercise
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h;

    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    d = a + b;
    e = a - b;
    f = a * b;
    g = a / b;

    printf("Addition: %d + %d = %d\n", a, b, d);
    printf("Subtraction: %d - %d = %d\n", a, b, e);
    printf("Multiplication: %d * %d = %d\n", a, b, f);
    printf("Division: %d / %d = %d\n", a, b, g);

    h = g + c;
    printf("Result of adding %d to result of division: %d + %d = %d\n", c, g, h);

    return;
}
```
