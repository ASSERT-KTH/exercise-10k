## Exercise
Write a function that takes two arrays of integers as input and returns a new array where the elements at the same index in both input arrays are swapped. If the arrays are of different lengths, the function should append the remaining elements from the longer array to the end of the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def swap_elements(array1, array2):
    """
    This function takes two arrays of integers as input and returns a new array where 
    the elements at the same index in both input arrays are swapped. If the arrays are 
    of different lengths, the function appends the remaining elements from the longer 
    array to the end of the result.

    Args:
        array1 (list): The first array of integers.
        array2 (list): The second array of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new array with the elements swapped and the remaining elements appended.
    """

    # Calculate the minimum length between the two arrays
    min_length = min(len(array1), len(array2))
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the range of the minimum length
    for i in range(min_length):
        # Append the element from the second array at the current index to the result
        result.append(array2[i])
        # Append the element from the first array at the current index to the result
        result.append(array1[i])
    
    # If the first array is longer than the second array
    if len(array1) > len(array2):
        # Append the remaining elements from the first array to the result
        result.extend(array1[min_length:])
    # If the second array is longer than the first array
    elif len(array2) > len(array1):
        # Append the remaining elements from the second array to the result
        result.extend(array2[min_length:])
    
    # Return the result
    return result
```
