## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user a series of questions, then keeps track of the user's score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the questions, answers, and scores
questions = [
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "answer": "Jupiter"},
    {"question": "Who painted the Mona Lisa?", "answer": "Leonardo da Vinci"},
    {"question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?", "answer": "Au"},
    {"question": "What is the largest living species of lizard?", "answer": "Komodo dragon"}
]

def quiz():
    # Initialize the score
    score = 0

    # Ask each question and check the answer
    for i, q in enumerate(questions, start=1):
        print(f"\nQuestion {i}: {q['question']}")
        user_answer = input("Your answer: ")

        # Check if the user's answer matches the correct answer
        if user_answer.lower() == q["answer"].lower():
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {q['answer']}.")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"\nQuiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    quiz()
```
