## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The function should iterate over the list and keep track of the maximum value found so far.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_value(num_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        max_val: The maximum value in the list.
    """

    # First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, we raise a ValueError because we can't find the maximum value of an empty list.
    if not num_list:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    # We initialize the max_val variable with the first element of the list. This will be our initial guess for the maximum value.
    # The reason we start with the first element is that we need to start the comparison from somewhere, and the first element is as good as any other.
    max_val = num_list[0]

    # Now, we iterate over the rest of the list. We start from the second element (index 1) because we've already considered the first element.
    for num in num_list[1:]:
        # Inside the loop, we check if the current number is greater than our current max_val.
        # If it is, we update max_val to be the current number. This way, max_val will always hold the maximum value we've seen so far.
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num

    # After the loop finishes, max_val will hold the maximum value in the list. We return this value.
    return max_val
```
