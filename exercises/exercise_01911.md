## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the fuel efficiency given the distance traveled and amount of fuel consumed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed):
    """
    Calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.

    Args:
        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.
        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed in gallons.

    Returns:
        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
    """
    if fuel_consumed == 0:
        return 0
    return distance / fuel_consumed

def main():
    print("Fuel Efficiency Calculator")
    print("---------------------------")

    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in miles: "))
    fuel_consumed = float(input("Enter the amount of fuel consumed in gallons: "))

    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)

    print(f"Fuel Efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Fuel Efficiency Calculator
---------------------------
Enter the distance traveled in miles: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmps0je3w99.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmps0je3w99.py", line 20, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in miles: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '500 25'
