## Exercise
Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Fibonacci Sequence
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

# Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

# Code
a, b = 0, 1
for i in range(10):
    print(a, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b
print()

# Output
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

## Generated Output
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
