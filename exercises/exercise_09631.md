## Exercise
Write a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose(f, g):
    """
    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.
    
    The composition of two functions f and g is a new function that applies g first and then applies f to the result.
    
    Args:
        f (function): The first function to be applied in the composition.
        g (function): The second function to be applied in the composition.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.
    """

    # We want to create a new function that represents the composition of f and g
    # This new function will take one argument, x
    
    # Define a new function that takes one argument, x
    def composed_function(x):
        
        # First, we apply g to x
        # This is because in the composition of f and g, g is applied first
        intermediate_result = g(x)
        
        # Then, we apply f to the result of g(x)
        # This is the final step in the composition of f and g
        final_result = f(intermediate_result)
        
        # Return the final result
        return final_result
    
    # Return the new function that represents the composition of f and g
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

# Create a new function that is the composition of double and add_one
double_then_add_one = compose(double, add_one)

# Test the new function
print(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
12
```
