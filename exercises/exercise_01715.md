## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """

    # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
    a, b = 0, 1

    # Initialize an empty list to store the sequence
    fibonacci_sequence = []

    # Use a for loop to generate the sequence
    for _ in range(n):
        # Append the current number to the sequence
        fibonacci_sequence.append(a)

        # Calculate the next number in the sequence
        a, b = b, a + b

    return fibonacci_sequence


def main():
    # Example usage
    n = 10  # Generate the first 10 numbers in the sequence
    print(generate_fibonacci(n))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
