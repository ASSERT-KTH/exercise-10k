## Exercise
Create a program that validates a password based on its length and complexity. The program should use if/else statements to determine the password's validity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validates a password based on its length and complexity.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the minimum length of the password
    min_length = 8

    # Check if the password has the minimum length
    if len(password) < min_length:
        print("Password should have at least", min_length, "characters.")
        return False

    # Check if the password contains uppercase letters
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        print("Password should have at least one uppercase letter.")
        return False

    # Check if the password contains lowercase letters
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        print("Password should have at least one lowercase letter.")
        return False

    # Check if the password contains digits
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        print("Password should have at least one digit.")
        return False

    # Check if the password contains special characters
    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):
        print("Password should have at least one special character.")
        return False

    # If all checks pass, the password is valid
    print("Password is valid.")
    return True


def main():
    # Example usage
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    validate_password(password)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password is valid.
```
