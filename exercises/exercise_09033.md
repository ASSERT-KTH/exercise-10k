## Exercise
Create a function that takes three numbers as arguments and returns their average

## Reference Solution
```python
def average_numbers(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the average of three numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.
        c (float): The third number.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the three input numbers.
    """
    return (a + b + c) / 3

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 20
    num3 = 30
    average = average_numbers(num1, num2, num3)
    print(f"The average of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {average}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of 10, 20, and 30 is 20.0.
```
