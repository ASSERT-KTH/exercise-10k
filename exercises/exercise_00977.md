## Exercise
Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the symmetric difference between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the dictionaries.

## Reference Solution
```python
def symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function calculates the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.
    
    The symmetric difference of two dictionaries is a new dictionary containing 
    the key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the input dictionaries.

    Args:
        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the symmetric difference between dict1 and dict2.
    """

    # Create a new dictionary to store the symmetric difference
    symmetric_diff = {}

    # Iterate over the items in the first dictionary
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        # If the key is not in the second dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference
        if key not in dict2:
            # Add the key-value pair to the symmetric difference dictionary
            symmetric_diff[key] = value

    # Iterate over the items in the second dictionary
    for key, value in dict2.items():
        # If the key is not in the first dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference
        if key not in dict1:
            # Add the key-value pair to the symmetric difference dictionary
            symmetric_diff[key] = value

    # Return the symmetric difference dictionary
    return symmetric_diff


# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}

print(symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'd': 5}
```
