## Exercise
Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a given character in a string with another character and prints out the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def replace_char(string, char_to_replace, new_char):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of a given character in a string with another character.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        char_to_replace (str): The character to be replaced.
        new_char (str): The new character.

    Returns:
        str: The string with all occurrences of char_to_replace replaced by new_char.
    """
    return string.replace(char_to_replace, new_char)

def main():
    # Example usage
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    char_to_replace = input("Enter the character to replace: ")
    new_char = input("Enter the new character: ")

    result = replace_char(string, char_to_replace, new_char)
    print("Result: ", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Enter the character to replace: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpy960ix82.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpy960ix82.py", line 18, in main
    char_to_replace = input("Enter the character to replace: ")
