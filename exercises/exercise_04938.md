## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years. The program should use the formula compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** years to calculate the compound interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Title: Compound Interest Calculator
# Author: [Your Name]
# Creation Date: [Today's Date]
# Python Version: 3.9

def compound_interest(principal, rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money
        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 5% = 0.05)
        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for

    Returns:
        float: The compound interest
    """
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** years

# Example usage:
p = 1000
r = 0.05
y = 5

result = compound_interest(p, r, y)
print(f"The compound interest is: {result:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The compound interest is: 1276.28
```
