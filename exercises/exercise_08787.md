## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their least common multiple.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers
    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)
    
    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)
    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd
    
    return lcm

# Get the two numbers as input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate and print the LCM
lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
print("The least common multiple of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", lcm)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9mofyohc.py", line 13, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 15'
```
