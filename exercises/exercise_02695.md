## Exercise
Write a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI based on the following formula: BMI = weight / height^2.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    """
    Calculates the BMI of a person.

    Args:
        weight (float): The weight of the person in kg.
        height (float): The height of the person in meters.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated BMI.
    """
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    return bmi

def get_bmi_category(bmi):
    """
    Determines the BMI category based on the calculated BMI.

    Args:
        bmi (float): The calculated BMI.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding BMI category.
    """
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "Underweight"
    elif bmi < 25:
        return "Normal"
    elif bmi < 30:
        return "Overweight"
    else:
        return "Obese"

def main():
    # Get user input for weight and height
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
    height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

    # Calculate the BMI
    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

    # Determine the BMI category
    category = get_bmi_category(bmi)

    # Print the results
    print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
    print(f"Your BMI category is: {category}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpablbufqq.py", line 50, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpablbufqq.py", line 36, in main
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '70, 1.75'
