## Exercise
Write a program that determines if a person is eligible for a loan based on their income and credit score. If the income is above $50,000 and the credit score is above 600, the person is eligible for a loan. If the income is below $30,000 or the credit score is below 500, the person is not eligible for a loan. If the income and credit score are between these ranges, the person may be eligible for a loan.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score):
    """
    Determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on their income and credit score.

    Args:
        income (float): The person's annual income in dollars.
        credit_score (int): The person's credit score.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the person is eligible, not eligible, or may be eligible for a loan.
    """

    # Check if the income is above $50,000 and the credit score is above 600
    if income > 50000 and credit_score > 600:
        return "You are eligible for a loan."

    # Check if the income is below $30,000 or the credit score is below 500
    if income < 30000 or credit_score < 500:
        return "You are not eligible for a loan."

    # If the income and credit score are between these ranges, the person may be eligible for a loan
    return "You may be eligible for a loan. Please contact us for further review."


def main():
    # Get the person's income and credit score
    income = float(input("Enter your annual income: $"))
    credit_score = int(input("Enter your credit score: "))

    # Determine the loan eligibility
    eligibility_message = determine_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score)

    # Print the eligibility message
    print(eligibility_message)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your annual income: $
