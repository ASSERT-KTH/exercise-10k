## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the future value of an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_future_value(principal, interest_rate, time_period):
    """
    Calculate the future value of an investment.

    Args:
    principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.
    interest_rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.
    time_period (int): The number of years the money is invested for.

    Returns:
    float: The future value of the investment.
    """
    # Calculate the future value using the formula for compound interest
    future_value = principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** time_period

    return future_value

def main():
    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    interest_rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in percent): ")) / 100
    time_period = int(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate the future value
    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, interest_rate, time_period)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The future value of the investment is: ${future_value:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpy7fsoy05.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpy7fsoy05.py", line 20, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
