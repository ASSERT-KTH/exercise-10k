## Exercise
Create a program to convert standard time to military time. If the hour is above 12, subtract 12 from the hour and add 'PM' to the time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_to_military_time(hours, minutes, period):
    """
    Converts standard time to military time.

    Args:
        hours (int): The hour in standard time.
        minutes (int): The minutes in standard time.
        period (str): The period of the day, either 'AM' or 'PM'.

    Returns:
        str: The time in military format.
    """
    if period.upper() == 'PM' and hours != 12:
        hours += 12
    elif period.upper() == 'AM' and hours == 12:
        hours = 0

    return f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}"

def main():
    # Example usage
    hours = int(input("Enter the hour (1-12): "))
    minutes = int(input("Enter the minutes (0-59): "))
    period = input("Enter the period (AM/PM): ")

    military_time = convert_to_military_time(hours, minutes, period)
    print(f"The military time is: {military_time}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the hour (1-12): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpu9jfn71w.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpu9jfn71w.py", line 22, in main
    hours = int(input("Enter the hour (1-12): "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '14:30'
