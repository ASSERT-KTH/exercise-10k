## Exercise
Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array of integers.
    """
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort
        swapped = False

        # Start looking at each item of the array one by one, comparing it with its adjacent value
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next one, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                # Swap values
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                # Set the flag to True so we'll loop again
                swapped = True

        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the array is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    return arr

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", bubble_sort(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
