## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for two strings and then prints out their concatenation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Ask the user for two strings
str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

# Concatenate the strings
concatenated_str = str1 + str2

# Print the concatenated string
print("The concatenation of the two strings is: ", concatenated_str)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first string: Enter the second string: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp4ubbh1r8.py", line 3, in <module>
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
