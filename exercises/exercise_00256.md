## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists as input, and returns True if the first list is a superset of the second list, and False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_superset(list1, list2):
    """
    Checks if the first list is a superset of the second list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The potential superset list.
        list2 (list): The potential subset list.

    Returns:
        bool: True if list1 is a superset of list2, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # We use the built-in set.issuperset() method in Python, which returns True if all elements of the specified set are present in the original set.
    # However, this method works with sets, not lists. So, we convert our lists to sets first.
    # We do this because sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, which makes them ideal for this kind of operation.
    set1 = set(list1)  # Convert list1 to a set
    set2 = set(list2)  # Convert list2 to a set

    # Now, we can use the issuperset() method to check if set1 is a superset of set2.
    # This will return True if all elements of set2 are present in set1, and False otherwise.
    return set1.issuperset(set2)
```
