## Exercise
Create a function that takes an array and two indices as input, and returns a new array where the elements at the given indices are swapped. The function should not modify the original array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def swap_elements(array, index1, index2):
    """
    This function takes an array and two indices as input, 
    and returns a new array where the elements at the given indices are swapped.
    
    Args:
        array (list): The input array.
        index1 (int): The first index.
        index2 (int): The second index.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new array with the elements at the given indices swapped.
    """

    # First, we need to make a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it
    new_array = array.copy()
    
    # Then, we check if the indices are valid (i.e., they are within the bounds of the array)
    if index1 < len(new_array) and index2 < len(new_array):
        
        # Now, we can swap the elements at the given indices
        # We use tuple packing and unpacking to achieve this in a single line
        new_array[index1], new_array[index2] = new_array[index2], new_array[index1]
    
    # Finally, we return the new array with the elements swapped
    return new_array

# Test the function
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
index1 = 1
index2 = 3
print(swap_elements(array, index1, index2))  # Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
```
