## Exercise
Write a program that takes a time in hours and minutes as input, and prints the equivalent time in minutes or hours, depending on the user's choice.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the variables
hours = 0
minutes = 0

# Function to convert time to minutes
def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):
    return hours * 60 + minutes

# Function to convert time to hours
def time_to_hours(hours, minutes):
    return hours + minutes / 60

# Main program
hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
minutes = int(input("Enter minutes: "))

choice = input("Do you want to convert to minutes (m) or hours (h)? ")

if choice == "m":
    print(f"{hours} hours and {minutes} minutes is equal to {time_to_minutes(hours, minutes)} minutes")
elif choice == "h":
    print(f"{hours} hours and {minutes} minutes is equal to {time_to_hours(hours, minutes):.2f} hours")
else:
    print("Invalid choice")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter hours: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpv6g65ni0.py", line 14, in <module>
    hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 hours'
```
