## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot calculate average of an empty list")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the numbers is: 3.0
