## Exercise
Write a program to print a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should consist of a series of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input provided by the user. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Use a for loop to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pattern(n):
    """
    Prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The number up to which the pattern should be printed.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(i, end=" ")

def main():
    # Get the input from the user
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Print the pattern
    print_pattern(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1 2 3 4 5
```
