## Exercise
Create a function that takes a string and a substring as arguments and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring_index(string, substring):
    """
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.

    Args:
        string (str): The string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if not found.
    """
    return string.find(substring)

# Example usage:
main_string = "Hello, world! Hello again!"
substring_to_find = "Hello"
index = find_substring_index(main_string, substring_to_find)

if index != -1:
    print(f"The substring '{substring_to_find}' was found at index {index}.")
else:
    print(f"The substring '{substring_to_find}' was not found.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The substring 'Hello' was found at index 0.
```
