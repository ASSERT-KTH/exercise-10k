## Exercise
Create a program that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules and output the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_board(board):
    """Print the Tic-Tac-Toe board."""
    print(f" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} ")

def check_winner(board):
    """Check if there is a winner."""
    winning_combinations = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for combination in winning_combinations:
        if board[combination[0]] == board[combination[1]] == board[combination[2]] != " ":
            return board[combination[0]]
    if " " not in board:
        return "Tie"
    return False

def main():
    """Main game loop."""
    board = [" "] * 9
    current_player = "X"

    while True:
        print_board(board)
        move = input(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9): ")
        if board[int(move) - 1] != " ":
            print("Invalid move, try again.")
            continue
        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player
        result = check_winner(board)
        if result:
            print_board(board)
            if result == "Tie":
                print("It's a tie!")
            else:
                print(f"Player {result} wins!")
            break
        current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
