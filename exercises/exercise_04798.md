## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers
questions = {
    "What is the capital of France?": {
        "A": "Paris",
        "B": "London",
        "C": "Berlin",
        "D": "Rome",
        "answer": "A"
    },
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": {
        "A": "Earth",
        "B": "Saturn",
        "C": "Jupiter",
        "D": "Uranus",
        "answer": "C"
    },
    "Who painted the Mona Lisa?": {
        "A": "Leonardo da Vinci",
        "B": "Michelangelo",
        "C": "Raphael",
        "D": "Caravaggio",
        "answer": "A"
    }
}

# Initialize the score
score = 0

# Ask each question and check the answer
for question, options in questions.items():
    print(question)
    for option, value in options.items():
        if option != "answer":
            print(f"{option}: {value}")
    answer = input("Choose your answer (A, B, C, D): ").upper()
    if answer == options["answer"]:
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {options['answer']}.\n")

# Print the final score
print(f"Quiz finished! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}")
```
