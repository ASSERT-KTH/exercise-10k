## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a character's health decreasing by 10 each round until they reach 0 health.

## Reference Solution
```python
def simulate_health_decrease(initial_health, health_decrease):
    """
    Simulate a character's health decreasing by a specified amount each round.

    Args:
        initial_health (int): The character's initial health.
        health_decrease (int): The amount of health to decrease each round.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    current_health = initial_health
    round_number = 1

    while current_health > 0:
        print(f"Round {round_number}: Health = {current_health}")
        current_health -= health_decrease
        round_number += 1

    print(f"Round {round_number}: Health = {current_health} (DEAD)")

def main():
    initial_health = 100
    health_decrease = 10

    simulate_health_decrease(initial_health, health_decrease)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Round 1: Health = 100
Round 2: Health = 90
Round 3: Health = 80
Round 4: Health = 70
Round 5: Health = 60
Round 6: Health = 50
Round 7: Health = 40
Round 8: Health = 30
Round 9: Health = 20
Round 10: Health = 10
Round 11: Health = 0 (DEAD)
```
