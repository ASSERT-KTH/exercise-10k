## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the result of exponentiating a number to a given power.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_exponent(base, exponent):
    """
    Calculate the result of exponentiating a base number to a given power.

    Args:
    base (float): The base number.
    exponent (float): The power to which the base is raised.

    Returns:
    float: The result of the exponentiation.
    """
    return base ** exponent

# Example usage:
base = 2.0
exponent = 3.0
result = calculate_exponent(base, exponent)
print(f"The result of {base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The result of 2.0 raised to the power of 3.0 is 8.0
```
