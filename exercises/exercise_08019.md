## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the alternating sum of a given list of integers. The alternating sum is calculated by subtracting the sum of the elements at even indices from the sum of the elements at odd indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def alternating_sum(lst):
    """
    This function calculates the alternating sum of a given list of integers.
    The alternating sum is calculated by subtracting the sum of the elements at even indices from the sum of the elements at odd indices.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The alternating sum of the given list.
    """

    # Initialize two variables to store the sum of elements at odd and even indices
    odd_sum = 0
    
    # We will use the index method to check if the index is odd or even
    # So, we don't need to initialize the even_sum variable here

    # Iterate over the list with their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        
        # Check if the index is odd
        if i % 2 != 0:
            # If the index is odd, add the number to the odd_sum
            odd_sum += num
        
        # If the index is even, we subtract the number from the odd_sum
        else:
            # So, we don't need to add the number to any variable
            # We can directly subtract it from the odd_sum
            odd_sum -= num
    
    # After iterating over the entire list, return the odd_sum
    # This will be the alternating sum of the given list
    return odd_sum
```
