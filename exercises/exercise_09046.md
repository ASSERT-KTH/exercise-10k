## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns True if the first is less than or equal to the second, False otherwise

## Reference Solution
```python
def compare_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    This function compares two numbers and returns True if the first number is less than or equal to the second number.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number for comparison.
        num2 (int): The second number for comparison.

    Returns:
        bool: True if num1 is less than or equal to num2, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if both inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")

    # Now, we can simply compare the two numbers using the <= operator.
    # This operator returns True if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
    return num1 <= num2
```
