## Exercise
Write a program that takes the principal amount, rate of interest, and time as input and returns the interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the simple interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The principal amount.
        rate (float): The rate of interest in percentage.
        time (float): The time in years.

    Returns:
        float: The simple interest.
    """
    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    return interest


def main():
    # Get user input
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (in %): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))

    # Calculate and display the interest
    interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)
    print(f"The simple interest is: {interest:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzmam84w_.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpzmam84w_.py", line 19, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
