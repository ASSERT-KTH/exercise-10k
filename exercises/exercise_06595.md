## Exercise
Write a program to find the LCM of two numbers using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b).

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def find_lcm(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the LCM of two numbers using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b).
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The LCM of the two numbers.
    """
    # Calculate the GCD of a and b using the math.gcd function
    gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the LCM using the formula
    lcm = abs(a * b) // gcd
    
    return lcm

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 12
    num2 = 15
    lcm = find_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60
```
