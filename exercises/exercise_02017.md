## Exercise
Write a program that takes a person's income as input and returns their tax using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculate tax based on income.

    The tax rates are as follows:
    - 0% on the first $10,000
    - 10% on income between $10,001 and $50,000
    - 20% on income between $50,001 and $100,000
    - 30% on income above $100,000
    """

    if income <= 10000:
        # 0% tax on the first $10,000
        tax = 0
    elif income <= 50000:
        # 10% tax on income between $10,001 and $50,000
        tax = (income - 10000) * 0.10
    elif income <= 100000:
        # 20% tax on income between $50,001 and $100,000
        tax = (50000 - 10000) * 0.10 + (income - 50000) * 0.20
    else:
        # 30% tax on income above $100,000
        tax = (50000 - 10000) * 0.10 + (100000 - 50000) * 0.20 + (income - 100000) * 0.30

    return tax

def main():
    # Get income from user
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))

    # Calculate tax
    tax = calculate_tax(income)

    # Print tax
    print(f"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: Your tax is: $4000.00
```
