## Exercise
Write a program to find the difference of two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def array_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The difference between the two arrays.
    """
    # Convert the arrays to sets for efficient lookups
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)

    # Calculate the difference
    diff = list(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))

    return diff

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    diff = array_difference(arr1, arr2)
    print("Array 1:", arr1)
    print("Array 2:", arr2)
    print("Difference:", diff)
```

## Generated Output
```
Array 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Difference: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
```
