## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total_sum += i
    return total_sum

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
print("The sum of all even numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum_even_numbers(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a positive integer: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
```
