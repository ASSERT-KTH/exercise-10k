## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance}.")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance}.")
        elif amount <= 0:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Your current balance is ${self.balance}.")

def main():
    account = BankAccount()
    
    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Thank you for using our bank account simulator!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
