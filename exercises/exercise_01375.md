## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The LCM of `a` and `b`.
    """
    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`
    gcd = math.gcd(a, b)

    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)
    lcm = (a * b) // gcd

    return lcm

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 12
    num2 = 15

    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)

    print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

## Generated Output
```
The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60
```
