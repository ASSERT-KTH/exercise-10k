## Exercise
Write a program to print the first N numbers in a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a while loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_first_n_numbers(numbers, n, condition):
    """
    Prints the first n numbers in the list that meet the given condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): The list of numbers to check.
        n (int): The number of matching numbers to print.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if it meets the condition, False otherwise.
    """
    count = 0
    index = 0
    while count < n and index < len(numbers):
        if condition(numbers[index]):
            print(numbers[index])
            count += 1
        index += 1

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
n = 5
condition = lambda x: x > 3  # Condition: numbers greater than 3

print("First {} numbers greater than 3:".format(n))
print_first_n_numbers(numbers, n, condition)
```

## Generated Output
```
First 5 numbers greater than 3:
4
5
6
7
8
```
