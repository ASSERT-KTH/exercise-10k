## Exercise
Write a function that returns a closure that captures its environment. Then, call this function with an input value and print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(input_value):
    """
    This function returns a closure that captures its environment.
    
    Args:
        input_value (any): The value to be captured by the closure.
    
    Returns:
        function: A closure that captures the input value and returns it when called.
    """
    
    # We define an inner function that will capture the environment of the outer function.
    def inner_function():
        # The inner function returns the input value passed to the outer function.
        return input_value
    
    # The outer function returns the inner function, which is now a closure.
    return inner_function

# We call the outer function with an input value and store the returned closure in a variable.
closure = outer_function("Hello, World!")

# We call the closure and print the result.
print(closure())  # Output: Hello, World!
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello, World!
```
