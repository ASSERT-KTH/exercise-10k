## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the mean of a set of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean of a set of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The mean of the numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    print(f"The mean of {numbers} is {mean}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The mean of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
```
