## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", average)
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0  # or some other suitable value
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
The average is: 3.0
```
