## Exercise
Write a program that filters a given list based on a given condition

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Filters a given list based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: The filtered list.
    """
    return [item for item in input_list if condition(item)]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter even numbers
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)

# Filter odd numbers
odd_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 != 0)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)

# Filter numbers greater than 5
greater_than_five = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)
print("Numbers greater than 5:", greater_than_five)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Numbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
