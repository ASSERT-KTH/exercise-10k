## Exercise
Create a program that determines the outcome of a simple game based on user input (win, lose, or draw) using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to determine the outcome of the game
def determine_game_outcome(outcome):
    """
    Determine the outcome of the game based on user input.

    Args:
        outcome (str): The outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating the outcome of the game.
    """
    if outcome.lower() == "win":
        return "Congratulations, you won the game!"
    elif outcome.lower() == "lose":
        return "Better luck next time, you lost the game."
    elif outcome.lower() == "draw":
        return "It's a draw! The game ended in a tie."
    else:
        return "Invalid outcome. Please enter win, lose, or draw."

# Main function to get user input and determine the game outcome
def main():
    print("Simple Game Outcome Determiner")
    print("---------------------------------")
    outcome = input("Enter the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw): ")
    result = determine_game_outcome(outcome)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Simple Game Outcome Determiner
---------------------------------
Enter the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw): Congratulations, you won the game!
