## Exercise
Write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the maximum of the three.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_of_three(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:
    """
    Returns the maximum of three numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.
        c (float): The third number.

    Returns:
        float: The maximum of the three numbers.
    """
    return max(a, b, c)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10.5
    num2 = 20.8
    num3 = 15.2
    max_num = max_of_three(num1, num2, num3)
    print(f"The maximum of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {max_num}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The maximum of 10.5, 20.8, and 15.2 is 20.8
```
