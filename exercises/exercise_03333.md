## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that are both even and greater than 5.

## Reference Solution
```python
def new_list(numbers):
    new_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 5 and num % 2 == 0:
            new_numbers.append(num)
    return new_numbers

def main():
    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20]
    print(new_list(numbers))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
[6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 20]
```
