## Exercise
Create a program that uses recursion to solve a given problem. The problem should be: calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    elif n > 1:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    # Error case: factorial is not defined for negative numbers
    else:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")

# Example usage:
def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    try:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpjt3lrolq.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpjt3lrolq.py", line 23, in main
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'number'
```
