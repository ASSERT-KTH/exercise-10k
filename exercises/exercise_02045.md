## Exercise
Create a function to delete an item from a dictionary by its key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def delete_item_by_key(dictionary, key):
    """
    Deletes an item from a dictionary by its key.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which to delete the item.
        key (any): The key of the item to be deleted.

    Returns:
        dict: The updated dictionary after deletion.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the key exists in the dictionary
    if key in dictionary:
        
        # If the key exists, we can use the pop() method to remove it from the dictionary
        # The pop() method removes and returns the value of the item with the specified key
        dictionary.pop(key)
        
        # After deleting the item, we return the updated dictionary
        return dictionary
    
    # If the key does not exist in the dictionary, we return a message indicating that
    else:
        print(f"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.")
        return dictionary

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "cherry": 3}
print(delete_item_by_key(my_dict, "banana"))  # Output: {'apple': 1, 'cherry': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'apple': 1, 'cherry': 3}
```
