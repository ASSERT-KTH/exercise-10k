## Exercise
Write a program to find the difference between two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def array_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: A new array containing elements that are in arr1 but not in arr2.
    """
    return [element for element in arr1 if element not in arr2]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    print("Array 1:", arr1)
    print("Array 2:", arr2)

    difference = array_difference(arr1, arr2)
    print("Difference:", difference)
```

## Generated Output
```
Array 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Difference: [1, 2, 3]
```
