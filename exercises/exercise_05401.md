## Exercise
Create a function named 'calculate_area' that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive numbers")
    
    area = length * width
    return area

# Example usage:
def main():
    try:
        length = 5.0
        width = 3.0
        area = calculate_area(length, width)
        print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The area of the rectangle with length 5.0 and width 3.0 is 15.0
```
