## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a character and outputs whether it is a vowel or not based on the following conditions: if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', output 'Vowel', if the character is not one of the above, output 'Not a vowel'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Take a character as input from the user
char = input("Enter a character: ")

# Check if the character is a vowel
if char == 'a' or char == 'e' or char == 'i' or char == 'o' or char == 'u':
    print("Vowel")
else:
    print("Not a vowel")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a character: Vowel
```
