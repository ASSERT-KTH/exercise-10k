## Exercise
Write a program to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user, asking for their choice and generating a random choice for the computer

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Ask for the user's choice."""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors."""
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors
