## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of attempts the user has made
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, the number was {}.".format(number_to_guess))
            break

        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue

        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.".format(attempts))
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_the_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too low!
Take a guess:
