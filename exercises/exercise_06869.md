## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements at even indices, as well as the sum of all elements at odd indices. The program should then print these two sums.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sumOddEven(arr):
    even = sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 == 0)
    odd = sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 != 0)
    return (even, odd)

# Test the function
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even, odd = sumOddEven(arr)
print("Sum of even indices:", even)
print("Sum of odd indices:", odd)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of even indices: 9
Sum of odd indices: 12
```
