## Exercise
Write a program that takes a radius as input and returns the area of a circle with that radius.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative.")

    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

def main():
    # Get the radius from the user
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

    try:
        # Calculate and print the area
        area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
        print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the radius of the circle: The area of the circle with radius 5.0 is 78.54.
```
