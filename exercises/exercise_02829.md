## Exercise
Develop a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a person's weight and height. If the BMI is below 18.5, the person is underweight. If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the person is normal weight. If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the person is overweight. If the BMI is above 30, the person is obese.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    """
    Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.

    Args:
    weight (float): Weight in kilograms (kg)
    height (float): Height in meters (m)

    Returns:
    float: Calculated BMI
    """
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    return bmi

def categorize_bmi(bmi):
    """
    Categorize the person based on the calculated BMI.

    Args:
    bmi (float): Calculated BMI

    Returns:
    str: Category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese)
    """
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "Underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
        return "Normal Weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
        return "Overweight"
    else:
        return "Obese"

def main():
    # Get user input
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms (kg): "))
    height = float(input("Enter your height in meters (m): "))

    # Calculate BMI
    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

    # Categorize BMI
    category = categorize_bmi(bmi)

    # Print results
    print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
    print(f"Your category is: {category}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kilograms (kg): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpasm0g1sl.py", line 50, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpasm0g1sl.py", line 36, in main
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms (kg): "))
