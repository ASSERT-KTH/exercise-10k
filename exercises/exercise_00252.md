## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are common to both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_elements(list1, list2):
    """
    Returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both input lists.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list.
        list2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the common elements.
    """
    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    print(common_elements(list1, list2))  # Output: [4, 5]
```

```python
def common_elements(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5]
```
