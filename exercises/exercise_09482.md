## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their grades as input. The program should calculate the average grade of all students and then print out each student's name along with their grade and a message indicating whether they passed (grade 50 or above) or failed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def grades(student_dict):
    """
    Takes a dictionary of student names and their grades.
    Calculates the average grade of all students and prints out each student's name along with their grade and a message indicating whether they passed (grade 50 or above) or failed.
    """
    total = 0
    for student, grade in student_dict.items():
        total += grade

    average = total / len(student_dict)

    for student, grade in student_dict.items():
        if grade >= 50:
            print(f"{student}'s grade is {grade}. Passed!")
        else:
            print(f"{student}'s grade is {grade}. Failed!")

# Example usage
grades({'John': 55, 'Emma': 70, 'Michael': 35, 'Sarah': 60, 'William': 20})
```

## Generated Output
```
John's grade is 55. Passed!
Emma's grade is 70. Passed!
Michael's grade is 35. Failed!
Sarah's grade is 60. Passed!
William's grade is 20. Failed!
```
