## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a nested dictionary with the same keys, but with values that are the results of applying a given function to the original values. The function should handle nested dictionaries of arbitrary depth.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transform_dict(input_dict, func):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary and a function as input. It returns a new dictionary 
    with the same keys, but with values that are the results of applying the given function 
    to the original values. The function handles nested dictionaries of arbitrary depth.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be transformed.
        func (function): The function to be applied to the dictionary values.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the same keys, but with transformed values.
    """

    # Create a new dictionary to store the results
    result = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # If the value is a dictionary, recursively call the function on it
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            # Add the transformed sub-dictionary to the result dictionary
            result[key] = transform_dict(value, func)
        else:
            # If the value is not a dictionary, apply the function to it and add it to the result dictionary
            result[key] = func(value)

    # Return the resulting dictionary
    return result
```
