## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the future value of an investment using compound interest. Use a for loop to iterate over the years and calculate the interest for each year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the future value of an investment using compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money.
        annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.
        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for.

    Returns:
        float: The future value of the investment.
    """

    # Initialize the future value to the principal
    future_value = principal

    # Iterate over each year
    for year in range(1, years + 1):
        # Calculate the interest for this year
        interest = future_value * annual_interest_rate

        # Add the interest to the future value
        future_value += interest

        # Print the future value for this year
        print(f'Year {year}: The future value is ${future_value:.2f}')

    return future_value


def main():
    # Get the principal, annual interest rate, and years from the user
    principal = float(input("Enter the initial investment amount: $"))
    annual_interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): ")) / 100
    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    # Calculate and print the future value
    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)

    print(f'\nThe future value of your investment after {years} years is ${future_value:.2f}')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the initial investment amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp0gh4wx7b.py", line 44, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp0gh4wx7b.py", line 33, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the initial investment amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 0.05'
