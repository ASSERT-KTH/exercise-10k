## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers and a threshold value as input, and returns a new list containing only the integers greater than the threshold.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Create a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Define an integer threshold value
threshold = 5

# Use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers greater than the threshold
greater_than_threshold = [n for n in numbers if n > threshold]

# Print the resulting list
print(greater_than_threshold)
```

## Generated Output
```
[6, 7, 8, 9]
```
