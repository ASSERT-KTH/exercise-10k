## Exercise
Write a program that determines a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_grade(score):
    """
    This function determines a student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """

    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score"

    # Determine the grade based on the score
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'


# Example usage:
def main():
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    grade = determine_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
