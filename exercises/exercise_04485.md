## Exercise
Create a function that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the user. The user inputs their choice, and the function generates a random choice and determines the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    """
    Plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the user.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Define the possible choices
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    # Get the user's choice
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()

    # Validate the user's choice
    while user_choice not in choices:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

    # Determine the winner
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
    elif user_choice == "rock":
        if computer_choice == "scissors":
            print(f"Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
        else:
            print(f"Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user_choice == "paper":
        if computer_choice == "rock":
            print(f"Paper covers rock! You win!")
        else:
            print(f"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user_choice == "scissors":
        if computer_choice == "paper":
            print(f"Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
        else:
            print(f"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")

    # Print the choices
    print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\n")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_rock_paper_scissors()
```

## Generated Output
