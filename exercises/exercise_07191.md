## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_numbers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total

# Example usage:
n = 10
result = sum_of_numbers(n)
print(f"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```
