## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):
    """
    Calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.

    Args:
        a (float): Length of side a
        b (float): Length of side b
        c (float): Length of side c

    Returns:
        float: Perimeter of the triangle
    """
    # Check if the sides can form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        raise ValueError("The sides cannot form a valid triangle")

    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = a + b + c
    return perimeter

def main():
    # Example usage
    a = 3  # Length of side a
    b = 4  # Length of side b
    c = 5  # Length of side c

    try:
        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)
        print(f"The perimeter of the triangle is: {perimeter}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The perimeter of the triangle is: 12
```
