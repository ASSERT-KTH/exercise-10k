## Exercise
Create a program to check if a given graph is connected or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, num_vertices):
        self.num_vertices = num_vertices
        self.adj_list = defaultdict(list)

    def add_edge(self, v, w):
        """Add an edge between vertices v and w."""
        self.adj_list[v].append(w)
        self.adj_list[w].append(v)

    def is_connected(self):
        """Check if the graph is connected."""
        visited = [False] * self.num_vertices

        # Start DFS from vertex 0
        self._dfs(0, visited)

        # If all vertices are visited, the graph is connected
        return all(visited)

    def _dfs(self, vertex, visited):
        """Perform DFS from a given vertex."""
        visited[vertex] = True

        for neighbor in self.adj_list[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                self._dfs(neighbor, visited)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a graph with 5 vertices
    graph = Graph(5)

    # Add edges to the graph
    graph.add_edge(0, 1)
    graph.add_edge(1, 2)
    graph.add_edge(2, 3)
    graph.add_edge(3, 4)

    # Check if the graph is connected
    if graph.is_connected():
        print("The graph is connected.")
    else:
        print("The graph is not connected.")

    # Create a disconnected graph
    graph2 = Graph(5)

    # Add edges to the graph
    graph2.add_edge(0, 1)
    graph2.add_edge(1, 2)
    graph2.add_edge(3, 4)

    # Check if the graph is connected
    if graph2.is_connected():
        print("The graph is connected.")
    else:
        print("The graph is not connected.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The graph is connected.
The graph is not connected.
```
