## Exercise
Create a function that uses parallel processing to compute the sum of a list of numbers in parallel

## Reference Solution
```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

def partial_sum(numbers):
    """
    Compute the sum of a list of numbers.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers)

def parallel_sum(numbers, num_processes):
    """
    Compute the sum of a list of numbers in parallel.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    num_processes (int): The number of processes to use.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the numbers.
    """
    # Split the list into chunks
    chunks = np.array_split(numbers, num_processes)

    # Create a pool of worker processes
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        # Compute the sum of each chunk in parallel
        partial_sums = pool.map(partial_sum, chunks)

    # Compute the total sum
    total_sum = sum(partial_sums)

    return total_sum

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    num_processes = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    result = parallel_sum(numbers, num_processes)
    print(f"Sum: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum: 55
```
