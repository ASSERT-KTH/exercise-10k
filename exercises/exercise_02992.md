## Exercise
Write a program that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_difference(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum difference between any two elements in the list.
    """
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return 0

    # Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)

    # Calculate the maximum difference
    max_diff = max_num - min_num

    return max_diff

# Example usage:
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("Maximum difference:", max_difference(numbers))
```

```python
def max_difference(numbers):
    return max(numbers) - min(numbers) if numbers else 0
```

## Generated Output
```
Maximum difference: 40
```
