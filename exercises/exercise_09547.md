## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing grade of 60. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int grade;

    printf("Enter your grade: ");
    scanf("%d", &grade);

    if (grade >= 60) {
        printf("You passed\n");
    } else {
        printf("You failed\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
