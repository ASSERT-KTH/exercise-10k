## Exercise
Write a program that checks the temperature and prints out whether it's hot, warm, or cold. The temperature is hot if it's above 25 degrees Celsius, warm if it's between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius, and cold if it's below 15 degrees Celsius.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_temperature(temp):
    """
    Checks the temperature and prints out whether it's hot, warm, or cold.
    
    Parameters:
    temp (float): Temperature in degrees Celsius.
    """
    
    # Check if temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius
    if temp > 25:
        print(f"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's hot.")
    
    # Check if temperature is between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius
    elif 15 <= temp <= 25:
        print(f"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's warm.")
    
    # If temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius
    else:
        print(f"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's cold.")


def main():
    # Example usage
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    check_temperature(temperature)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: The temperature is 22.0 degrees Celsius. It's warm.
```
