## Exercise
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print out the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
// Author: [Your Name]
// Date: [Today's Date]

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3, add, sub, mul, divi;

    cout << "Enter 1st number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter 2nd number: ";
    cin >> num2;
    cout << "Enter 3rd number: ";
    cin >> num3;

    // Perform operations
    add = num1 + num2 + num3;
    sub = num1 - num2 - num3;
    mul = num1 * num2 * num3;
    divi = num1 / num2 / num3;

    // Print results
    cout << "Addition: " << add << endl;
    cout << "Subtraction: " << sub << endl;
    cout << "Multiplication: " << mul << endl;
    cout << "Division: " << divi << endl;

    return 0;
}
