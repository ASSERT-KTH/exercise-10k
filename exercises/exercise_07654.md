## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the norm of a vector.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_vector_norm(vector):
    """
    Calculate the norm of a vector.

    Args:
        vector (list): A list of numbers representing the components of the vector.

    Returns:
        float: The norm of the vector.
    """
    return math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in vector))

# Example usage:
vector = [3, 4]
norm = calculate_vector_norm(vector)
print(f"The norm of the vector {vector} is {norm}")
```

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_vector_norm(vector):
    """
    Calculate the norm of a vector using NumPy.

    Args:
        vector (list): A list of numbers representing the components of the vector.

    Returns:
        float: The norm of the vector.
    """
    return np.linalg.norm(vector)

# Example usage:
vector = [3, 4]
norm = calculate_vector_norm(vector)
print(f"The norm of the vector {vector} is {norm}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The norm of the vector [3, 4] is 5.0
```
