## Exercise
Write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Example usage:
num1 = 48
num2 = 18
print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd(num1, num2)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6
```
