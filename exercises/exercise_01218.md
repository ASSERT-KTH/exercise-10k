## Exercise
Write a function that checks if a given number is a perfect square.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)
    return sqrt == int(sqrt)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [16, 20, 25, 30, 36]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"{num} is a perfect square: {is_perfect_square(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
16 is a perfect square: True
20 is a perfect square: False
25 is a perfect square: True
30 is a perfect square: False
36 is a perfect square: True
```
