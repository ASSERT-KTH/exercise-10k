## Exercise
Write a program that allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe

## Reference Solution
```python
# Tic-Tac-Toe game program

# Import required modules
import os

# Function to print the game board
def print_board(board):
    print(f" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} ")

# Function to check if a player has won
def check_win(board, player):
    winning_combinations = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for combination in winning_combinations:
        if board[combination[0]] == board[combination[1]] == board[combination[2]] == player:
            return True
    return False

# Function to check if the game is a draw
def check_draw(board):
    return " " not in board

# Main game loop
def play_game():
    board = [" "] * 9
    current_player = "X"

    while True:
        os.system("cls" if os.name == "nt" else "clear")
        print_board(board)
        print(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9):")
        move = input()

        # Validate the move
        if not move.isdigit() or not 1 <= int(move) <= 9:
            print("Invalid move. Please try again.")
            input("Press Enter to continue...")
            continue

        move = int(move) - 1

        # Check if the cell is already occupied
        if board[move] != " ":
            print("Cell already occupied. Please try again.")
            input("Press Enter to continue...")
            continue

        # Make the move
        board[move] = current_player

        # Check if the game is over
        if check_win(board, current_player):
            os.system("cls" if os.name == "nt" else "clear")
            print_board(board)
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break
        elif check_draw(board):
            os.system("cls" if os.name == "nt" else "clear")
            print_board(board)
            print("It's a draw!")
            break

        # Switch to the other player
        current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

# Run the game
play_game()
```
