## Exercise
Create a function that finds the difference between two lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def list_difference(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two lists.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list.
        list2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A list of elements that are present in list1 but not in list2.
    """
    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(list_difference(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Alternatively, you can use set difference for faster results:
def list_difference_set(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two lists using set difference.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list.
        list2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A list of elements that are present in list1 but not in list2.
    """
    return list(set(list1) - set(list2))

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(list_difference_set(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
```
