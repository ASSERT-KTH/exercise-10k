## Exercise
Create a program to play Mad Libs with the user. The user should be able to input different types of words (e.g. noun, verb, adjective), and the program should use those words to fill in the blanks in a story.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input for a specific word type
def get_word(prompt):
    """Get a word from the user."""
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:
            return word
        else:
            print("Please enter a word.")

# Define a function to play Mad Libs
def play_mad_libs():
    """Play Mad Libs with the user."""
    print("Welcome to Mad Libs! Please provide the following words:")

    # Get user input for different word types
    noun = get_word("Enter a noun: ")
    verb = get_word("Enter a verb: ")
    adjective = get_word("Enter an adjective: ")
    place = get_word("Enter a place: ")
    person = get_word("Enter a person's name: ")

    # Define the story with blanks
    stories = [
        f"One day, {person} was walking through the {adjective} forest when they stumbled upon a {noun}. They decided to {verb} it and take it to the {place}.",
        f"{person} loved to {verb} in the {adjective} {place} with their favorite {noun}.",
        f"In a far-off {place}, there lived a {adjective} {noun} who loved to {verb} with {person}."
    ]

    # Select a random story and print it
    story = random.choice(stories)
    print("\nHere's your Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

# Main function
def main():
    play_again = "y"
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        play_mad_libs()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
    print("Thanks for playing Mad Libs!")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Mad Libs! Please provide the following words:
Enter a noun: Enter a verb:

    word = input(prompt)
