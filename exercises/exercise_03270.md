## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate coin flips until the user chooses to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    """Simulate a coin flip and return the result."""
    return "Heads" if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else "Tails"

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Coin Flip Simulator!")
    play_again = "y"
    
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        print(f"\nYou flipped a coin and got: {coin_flip()}")
        play_again = input("Do you want to flip again? (y/n): ")
        
        # Validate user input
        while play_again.lower() not in ["y", "n"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no: ")
    
    print("\nThanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
