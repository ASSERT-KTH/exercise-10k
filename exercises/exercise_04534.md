## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a function as input and applies the function to the first two elements in the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until only one element remains.

## Reference Solution
```python
function reduce_list(lst, func) {
  while (lst.length > 1) {
    lst = [func(lst[0], lst[1])].concat(lst.slice(2));
  }
  return lst[0];
}
```
