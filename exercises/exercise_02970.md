## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. The program should use a set of coins with different denominations.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(amount, coins):
    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins for each amount from 0 to the given amount
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    
    # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount
    dp[0] = 0
    
    # For each coin
    for coin in coins:
        # For each amount from the coin value to the given amount
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            # If using the current coin results in a smaller number of coins, update the dp list
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    # If no combination of coins can make the given amount, return -1
    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return dp[amount]

# Example usage:
amount = 11
coins = [1, 2, 5]
print(min_coins(amount, coins))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
3
```
