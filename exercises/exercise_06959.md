## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary and a key as arguments and returns the corresponding value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    This function retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key: The key to search for in the dictionary.

    Returns:
        The value associated with the key if found, otherwise None.
    """

    # First, we check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("The first argument must be a dictionary.")

    # Then, we try to get the value from the dictionary
    # The get method of a dictionary returns None if the key is not found
    # This is a safer approach than directly accessing the key with dictionary[key]
    # Because that would raise a KeyError if the key is not found
    value = dictionary.get(key)
    
    # Finally, we return the value
    return value

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(get_dict_value(my_dict, "name"))  # Outputs: John
print(get_dict_value(my_dict, "age"))   # Outputs: 30
print(get_dict_value(my_dict, "city"))  # Outputs: None
```

## Generated Output
```
John
30
None
```
