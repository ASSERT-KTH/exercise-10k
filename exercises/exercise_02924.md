## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    # Initialize the result variable to 1
    result = 1
    
    # Initialize the counter variable to 1
    i = 1
    
    # Loop until the counter is greater than the input number
    while i <= n:
        # Multiply the result by the current counter
        result *= i
        
        # Increment the counter
        i += 1
    
    # Return the calculated factorial
    return result

# Test the function
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
