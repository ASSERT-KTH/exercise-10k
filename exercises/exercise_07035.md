## Exercise
Write a program that takes an exam score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
print("Your grade is:", grade(score))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
