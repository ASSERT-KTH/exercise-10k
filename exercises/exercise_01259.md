## Exercise
Write a higher-order function that reduces a list to a single value based on a given function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduce_list(lst, func):
    """
    Reduces a list to a single value based on a given function.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to be reduced.
        func (function): The function used to reduce the list.

    Returns:
        The reduced value.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")

    # Initialize the result with the first element of the list
    # This is because we need a starting point for our reduction
    result = lst[0]
    
    # Iterate over the rest of the list
    # We start from index 1 because we've already used the first element as our initial result
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        # Apply the given function to the current result and the current element
        # The result of this function call becomes our new result
        result = func(result, lst[i])
    
    # After iterating over the entire list, return the final result
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(reduce_list(numbers, add))  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
