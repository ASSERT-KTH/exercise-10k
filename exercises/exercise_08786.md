## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test the function
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print("The greatest common divisor of", num1, "and", num2, "is", gcd(num1, num2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpghofo_t4.py", line 17, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '48 18'
```
