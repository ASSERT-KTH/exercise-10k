## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a To-Do list app, where users can add tasks and view the list until they choose to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize an empty list to store tasks
tasks = []

# Initialize a variable to store user's choice
choice = ""

# Loop until user chooses to quit
while choice.lower() != "quit":
    # Print the menu
    print("\nTo-Do List App")
    print("1. Add Task")
    print("2. View Tasks")
    print("3. Quit")

    # Ask user for their choice
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1, 2, or 'quit'): ")

    # Handle user's choice
    if choice == "1":
        # Ask user for task description
        task = input("Enter task description: ")
        # Add task to the list
        tasks.append(task)
        print(f"Task '{task}' added successfully!")
    elif choice == "2":
        # Check if tasks list is empty
        if not tasks:
            print("No tasks in the list.")
        else:
            # Print tasks
            print("\nYour Tasks:")
            for i, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
                print(f"{i}. {task}")
    elif choice.lower() == "quit":
        print("Goodbye!")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# End of program
```

1. Add Task
