## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input and output the calculated area and perimeter.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int l, w;

    cout << "Enter length of rectangle: ";
    cin >> l;
    cout << "Enter width of rectangle: ";
    cin >> w;

    int a = l * w;
    int p = 2 * (l + w);

    cout << "The area of the rectangle is: " << a << endl;
    cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << p << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
