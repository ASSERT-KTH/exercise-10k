## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_s = ""
    for char in s:
        reversed_s = char + reversed_s
    return reversed_s

def main():
    s = input("Enter a string: ")
    print("Reversed string:", reverse_string(s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Reversed string: olleh
```
