Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_numbers(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total

# Test the function
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The sum of numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum_of_numbers(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
