## Exercise
Write a program that takes in the temperature and humidity and outputs the weather forecast based on the following conditions: if the temperature is above 25 and the humidity is above 60, output 'Rainy', if the temperature is above 25 and the humidity is below 60, output 'Sunny', if the temperature is below 25 and the humidity is above 60, output 'Cloudy', if the temperature is below 25 and the humidity is below 60, output 'Windy'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):
    """
    This function generates a weather forecast based on the given temperature and humidity.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature.
        humidity (float): The current humidity.

    Returns:
        str: The weather forecast.
    """
    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:
        return 'Rainy'
    elif temperature > 25 and humidity <= 60:
        return 'Sunny'
    elif temperature <= 25 and humidity > 60:
        return 'Cloudy'
    else:
        return 'Windy'

def main():
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
    humidity = float(input("Enter the humidity: "))
    forecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)
    print(f"The weather forecast is: {forecast}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6c_hlmqs.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6c_hlmqs.py", line 22, in main
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '28, 70'
```
