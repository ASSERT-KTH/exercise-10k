## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input provided by the user. The pattern should be printed using a loop, and each number should be on a new line. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, each on a new line.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# GitHub: [Your GitHub Profile]
# Twitter: [Your Twitter Handle]

# Ask the user to input a number
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to n
for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(i)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1
2
3
4
5
```
