## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """

    # First, we need to unpack the coordinates of the two points
    x1, y1 = point1  # Unpack the x and y coordinates of the first point
    x2, y2 = point2  # Unpack the x and y coordinates of the second point

    # Then, we calculate the difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates
    dx = x2 - x1  # Difference between the x-coordinates
    dy = y2 - y1  # Difference between the y-coordinates

    # Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance
    # The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the distance) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    distance_squared = dx ** 2 + dy ** 2  # Calculate the square of the distance

    # Finally, we take the square root of the distance squared to get the actual distance
    distance = math.sqrt(distance_squared)  # Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem

    return distance  # Return the calculated distance

# Example usage:
point1 = (1, 2)
point2 = (4, 6)
print(calculate_distance(point1, point2))  # Output: 5.0
```

## Generated Output
```
5.0
```
