## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers and a target integer as input, and returns the number of times the target integer appears in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def countInts(nums, target):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == target:
            count += 1
    return count

nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
target = 2
print(countInts(nums, target))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
3
```
