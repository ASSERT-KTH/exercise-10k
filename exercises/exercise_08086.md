## Exercise
Write a function that returns a function with a closure

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    Returns a function with a closure.
    
    Args:
        outer_variable (any): The variable to be captured by the closure.
    
    Returns:
        function: A function with access to the outer_variable.
    """
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        """
        The function with a closure.
        
        Args:
            inner_variable (any): The variable to be used by the inner function.
        
        Returns:
            any: The result of combining the outer_variable and inner_variable.
        """
        # The inner function has access to the outer_variable
        return f"Outer variable: {outer_variable}, Inner variable: {inner_variable}"
    
    # Return the inner function, which has a closure
    return inner_function

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a function with a closure
    func_with_closure = outer_function("Hello")

    # Use the function with a closure
    print(func_with_closure("World"))  # Output: Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World
```
