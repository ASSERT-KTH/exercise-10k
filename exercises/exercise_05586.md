## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_cube_volume(side_length: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.

    Args:
        side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the cube.
    """
    if side_length < 0:
        raise ValueError("Side length cannot be negative")
    return side_length ** 3

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    side_length = 5.0
    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)
    print(f"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The volume of the cube with side length 5.0 is 125.0
```
