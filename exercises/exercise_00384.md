## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the simple interest on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the simple interest on a loan given the principal amount, 
    interest rate, and time period.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of the loan.
        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.
        time (float): The time period of the loan in years.

    Returns:
        float: The simple interest on the loan.
    """
    # Calculate the simple interest using the formula: (P * R * T) / 100
    # Since the rate is given as a decimal, we don't need to divide by 100
    simple_interest = principal * rate * time
    
    return simple_interest


def main():
    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate the simple interest
    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The simple interest on the loan is: ${simple_interest:.2f}")
    print(f"The total amount to be paid is: ${principal + simple_interest:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpk5ljtcfp.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpk5ljtcfp.py", line 23, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
