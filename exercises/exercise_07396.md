## Exercise
Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age. Validate the input to ensure the name is not empty and the age is a positive integer. If the input is valid, print out a greeting message with the user's name and age. Otherwise, print an error message and ask for input again.

## Reference Solution
```python
def greet():
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")

    if name.strip() == "":
        print("Error: Name cannot be empty.")
    elif not age.isdigit():
        print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
    elif int(age) <= 0:
        print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpt_fk34tw.py", line 14, in <module>
    greet()
  File "/tmp/tmpt_fk34tw.py", line 3, in greet
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
