## Exercise
Create a function that uses the map function to double all numbers in a list. Use the function to double the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].

## Reference Solution
```python
# First, we define a function that doubles a number.
def double(number):
    """
    This function doubles a given number.

    Args:
        number (int or float): The number to be doubled.

    Returns:
        int or float: The doubled number.
    """
    # We simply return the number multiplied by 2.
    return number * 2

# Now, we use the map function to double all numbers in a list.
def double_all_numbers(numbers):
    """
    This function doubles all numbers in a given list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be doubled.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with all numbers doubled.
    """
    # We use the map function to apply the double function to each number in the list.
    # The map function returns a map object, so we convert it to a list.
    doubled_numbers = list(map(double, numbers))
    # We return the new list with all numbers doubled.
    return doubled_numbers

# Finally, we use the function to double the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled_numbers = double_all_numbers(numbers)
print(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```
