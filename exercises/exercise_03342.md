## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to sum all even numbers from 2 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(start, end):
    """Sum all even numbers in the given range."""
    total = 0
    num = start
    while num <= end:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
        num += 1
    return total

def main():
    start = 2
    end = 100
    result = sum_even_numbers(start, end)
    print(f"The sum of even numbers from {start} to {end} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of even numbers from 2 to 100 is: 2550
```
