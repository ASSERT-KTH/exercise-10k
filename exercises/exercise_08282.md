## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2

    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1

    # Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem
    distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

    return distance

def main():
    # Define the coordinates of the two points
    point1 = (1, 2)
    point2 = (4, 6)

    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The distance between the points {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f} units.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The distance between the points (1, 2) and (4, 6) is 5.00 units.
```
