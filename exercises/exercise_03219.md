## Exercise
Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the average of its digits.

## Reference Solution
```python
def average_of_digits(num):
    # Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit
    str_num = str(num)
    
    # Initialize sum and count of digits
    sum_of_digits = 0
    count_of_digits = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character (digit) in the string
    for digit in str_num:
        # Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the sum
        sum_of_digits += int(digit)
        # Increment the count of digits
        count_of_digits += 1
    
    # Check if the number has any digits
    if count_of_digits == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        # Calculate and return the average of the digits
        return sum_of_digits / count_of_digits

# Test the function
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The average of the digits is:", average_of_digits(num))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The average of the digits is: 3.0
```
