## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. Use basic algorithms to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_number(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None
    
    max_number = numbers[0]
    
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_number:
            max_number = number
    
    return max_number

# Test the function
numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]
print(find_max_number(numbers))  # Output: 89
```

## Generated Output
```
89
```
