## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_difference(num1: float, num2: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the difference between two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 - num2

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10.0
    num2 = 5.0
    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)
    print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The difference between 10.0 and 5.0 is 5.0
```
