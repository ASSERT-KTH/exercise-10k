## Exercise
Write a program to access and print the elements of an array at specific indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define an array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Define specific indices
indices = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Access and print elements at specific indices
for i in indices:
    print(f"Element at index {i}: {array[i]}")
```

```python
# Define a 2D array
array_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Define specific indices
indices_2d = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]

# Access and print elements at specific indices
for i, j in indices_2d:
    print(f"Element at index ({i}, {j}): {array_2d[i][j]}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Element at index 0: 1
Element at index 2: 3
Element at index 4: 5
Element at index 6: 7
Element at index 8: 9
```
