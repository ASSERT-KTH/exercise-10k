## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Compute the greatest common divisor of a and b.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Get two numbers from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate and print the GCD
print("The GCD of", num1, "and", num2, "is", gcd(num1, num2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxqqyxq5l.py", line 17, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 18'
```
