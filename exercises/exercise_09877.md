## Exercise
Write a program that takes a mathematical expression as input and evaluates it.

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_expression(expression):
    try:
        result = eval(expression)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

def main():
    expression = input("Enter a mathematical expression: ")
    result = evaluate_expression(expression)
    print("Result: ", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a mathematical expression: Result:  4
