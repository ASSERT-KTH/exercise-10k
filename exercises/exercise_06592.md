## Exercise
Write a program to find the standard deviation of all numbers in an array.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_variance(numbers, mean):
    """Calculate the variance of a list of numbers."""
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return variance

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers."""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers, mean)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
    print(f"Standard deviation: {std_dev:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Standard deviation: 1.41
```
