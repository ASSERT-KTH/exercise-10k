## Exercise
Create a program to validate a password using conditional statements to check for length and character requirements

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validate a password based on the following requirements:
    * The password must be at least 8 characters long.
    * The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
    * The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
    * The password must contain at least one digit.
    * The password must contain at least one special character.
    
    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one digit
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one special character
    if not re.search("[^A-Za-z0-9]", password):
        return False
    
    return True

def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    if validate_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following requirements:")
        print("* The password must be at least 8 characters long.")
        print("* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
        print("* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
        print("* The password must contain at least one digit.")
        print("* The password must contain at least one special character.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following requirements:
* The password must be at least 8 characters long.
* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
* The password must contain at least one digit.
* The password must contain at least one special character.
