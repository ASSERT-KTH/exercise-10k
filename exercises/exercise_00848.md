## Exercise
Write a function that returns a closure, which is a function that has access to its own scope and can use variables from that scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining a function that will return a closure.
def outer_function(message):
    """
    This function returns a closure, which is a function that has access to its own scope and can use variables from that scope.

    Args:
        message (str): The message to be printed by the closure.

    Returns:
        function: A closure that prints the given message.
    """

    # Now we define the inner function, which is the closure. It has access to the variables in the outer function's scope.
    def inner_function():
        # The closure can use the variables from the outer function's scope, like the 'message' variable.
        print(message)

    # Finally, we return the closure.
    return inner_function

# Example usage:
# Create a closure that prints "Hello, world!".
hello_world = outer_function("Hello, world!")

# Call the closure to print the message.
hello_world()
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello, world!
```
