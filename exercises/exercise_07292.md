## Exercise
Create a function that takes the total cost of a meal and the tip percentage as arguments and returns the total cost with the tip

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_with_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of a meal including a tip.

    Args:
        total_cost (float): The total cost of the meal.
        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost with the tip.
    """
    # Calculate the tip amount
    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * total_cost
    
    # Calculate the total cost with the tip
    total_with_tip = total_cost + tip_amount
    
    return total_with_tip

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    total_cost = 100.0
    tip_percentage = 15.0
    
    total_with_tip = calculate_total_with_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage)
    
    print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Tip percentage: {tip_percentage}%")
    print(f"Total with tip: ${total_with_tip:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Total cost: $100.00
Tip percentage: 15.0%
Total with tip: $115.00
```
