## Exercise
Write a function that transposes a given list of lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose(list_of_lists):
    """
    Transpose a given list of lists.

    Args:
    list_of_lists (list): A list of lists to be transposed.

    Returns:
    list: The transposed list of lists.
    """
    return list(map(list, zip(*list_of_lists)))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    print("Original List:")
    for row in list_of_lists:
        print(row)
    
    transposed_list = transpose(list_of_lists)
    print("\nTransposed List:")
    for row in transposed_list:
        print(row)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Transposed List:
[1, 4, 7]
[2, 5, 8]
[3, 6, 9]
```
