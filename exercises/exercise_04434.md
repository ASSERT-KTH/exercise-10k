## Exercise
Create a program that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def scramble_word(word):
    """Scramble a word by shuffling its characters."""
    word_list = list(word)
    random.shuffle(word_list)
    return ''.join(word_list)

def main():
    word = "hello"  # Change this to any word you want
    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)
    print(f"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}")

    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter your answer: ")
        if user_input.lower() == word.lower():
            print("Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed", word)
            break
        else:
            print("Incorrect. Try again!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Unscramble the word: ehllo
Enter your answer: Incorrect. Try again!
Enter your answer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6yxctums.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6yxctums.py", line 15, in main
    user_input = input("Enter your answer: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
