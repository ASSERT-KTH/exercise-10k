## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a list of the frequency of each word in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def word_frequencies(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input, splits it into words, 
    and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a word 
    and its frequency in the string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its frequency.
    """

    # Remove punctuation and convert to lower case
    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', input_string).lower()

    # Split the string into words
    words = cleaned_string.split()

    # Count the frequency of each word
    frequency = Counter(words)

    # Convert the frequency dictionary to a list of tuples
    frequency_list = list(frequency.items())

    return frequency_list

# Example usage:
input_str = "This is a test string. This string is just a test."
print(word_frequencies(input_str))
```

```python
[('this', 2), ('is', 2), ('a', 2), ('test', 2), ('string', 2), ('just', 1)]
```

## Generated Output
```
[('this', 2), ('is', 2), ('a', 2), ('test', 2), ('string', 2), ('just', 1)]
```
