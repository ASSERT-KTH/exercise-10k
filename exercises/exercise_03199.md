## Exercise
Create a program that takes a person's age as input and uses if/else statements to determine their age group (e.g., child, adult, senior).

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_age_group(age):
    """
    This function determines the age group of a person based on their age.

    Args:
        age (int): The age of the person.

    Returns:
        str: The age group of the person.
    """
    if age < 0:
        return "Invalid age. Age cannot be negative."
    elif age < 18:
        return "Child"
    elif age < 65:
        return "Adult"
    else:
        return "Senior"

def main():
    # Get the person's age from the user
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")

    # Determine the age group
    age_group = determine_age_group(age)

    # Print the age group
    print(f"Your age group is: {age_group}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your age: Your age group is: Adult
```
