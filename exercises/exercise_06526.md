def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    """

    """
    while True:
        # Get the user's choice
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors: ").lower()

        # Generate the computer's choice
        choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        # Determine the winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif user_choice == "rock":
