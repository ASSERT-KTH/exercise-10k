## Exercise
Create a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number. Then, call this function with an input number and print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Args:
    n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the input number.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        # Base case: factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        return n * factorial(n-1)


def main():
    # Example usage
    input_number = 5
    try:
        result = factorial(input_number)
        print(f"The factorial of {input_number} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
