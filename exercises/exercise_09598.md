## Exercise
Write a program that reads user input and handles any errors that occur during input processing

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """
    Reads user input and handles any errors that occur during input processing.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            # Attempt to read user input
            user_input = input("Please enter a number: ")

            # Attempt to convert the input to an integer
            user_input = int(user_input)

            # If successful, print the input and break the loop
            print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
            break

        except ValueError:
            # Handle the error if the input cannot be converted to an integer
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            # Handle the error if the user interrupts the program (e.g., with Ctrl+C)
            print("\nProgram interrupted. Exiting.")
            break

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any other unexpected errors
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_user_input()
```
