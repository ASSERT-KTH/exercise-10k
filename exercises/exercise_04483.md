## Exercise
Create a function that generates a random number between 1 and 100, then asks the user to guess the number. After each guess, tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of tries
    tries = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the random number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of tries
        tries += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.")
            break
        # Check if the user's guess is too high
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too high. Try a lower number.")
        # Check if the user's guess is too low
        else:
            print("Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the random number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Your guess is too high. Try a lower number.
Take a guess:
