## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a user's name and age as input. Validate the age to ensure it's within the range of 1 to 120. If the age is valid, output a greeting message with the user's name and age, formatted as 'Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.' Otherwise, output an error message indicating that the age is invalid.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_age(age):
    """Validate if the age is within the range of 1 to 120."""
    return 1 <= age <= 120


def get_user_info():
    """Get user's name and age as input."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if validate_age(age):
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid age. Age should be between 1 and 120.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
    return name, age


def print_greeting(name, age):
    """Print a greeting message with the user's name and age."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")


def main():
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print_greeting(name, age)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age:
