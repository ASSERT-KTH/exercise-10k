## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their personal information (name, age, address), and then prints out a formatted version of this information.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to get user information
def get_user_info():
    """Get user's personal information."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    address = input("Please enter your address: ")
    return name, age, address

# Define a function to print user information
def print_user_info(name, age, address):
    """Print user's personal information in a formatted way."""
    print("\nUser Information:")
    print("--------------------")
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Age: {age}")
    print(f"Address: {address}")
    print("--------------------")

# Main function
def main():
    name, age, address = get_user_info()
    print_user_info(name, age, address)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpuet29ra0.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpuet29ra0.py", line 21, in main
    name, age, address = get_user_info()
  File "/tmp/tmpuet29ra0.py", line 5, in get_user_info
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
