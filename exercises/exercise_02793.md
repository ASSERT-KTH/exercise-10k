## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list that includes only the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    This function filters a given list based on a provided condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the elements from the input list that satisfy the condition.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered elements
    filtered_list = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        
        # Check if the current element satisfies the condition
        if condition(element):
            
            # If the condition is met, append the element to the filtered list
            filtered_list.append(element)

    # Return the filtered list
    return filtered_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4]
```
