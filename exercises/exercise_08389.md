## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the binomial coefficient of two given numbers using Pascal's triangle.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    """
    Calculate the binomial coefficient of two given numbers using Pascal's triangle.

    Args:
        n (int): The total number of items.
        k (int): The number of items to choose.

    Returns:
        int: The binomial coefficient of n and k.
    """

    # Create a 2D array to store Pascal's triangle
    triangle = [[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Initialize the first row and column of Pascal's triangle
    for i in range(n + 1):
        triangle[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(k + 1):
        triangle[j][j] = 1

    # Calculate the rest of Pascal's triangle
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]

    # The binomial coefficient is stored in the nth row and kth column of Pascal's triangle
    return triangle[n][k]

# Test the function
n = 5
k = 3
print(f"The binomial coefficient of {n} and {k} is: {calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k)}")
```

```python
import math

n = 5
k = 3
print(f"The binomial coefficient of {n} and {k} is: {math.comb(n, k)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The binomial coefficient of 5 and 3 is: 10
```
