## Exercise
Write a program that prints out the day of the month based on a given date using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_day_of_month(year, month, day):
    """
    Returns the day of the month based on the given date.
    
    Parameters:
    year (int): The year of the date
    month (int): The month of the date
    day (int): The day of the date
    
    Returns:
    str: The day of the month (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
    """
    if day in [1, 21, 31]:
        suffix = "st"
    elif day in [2, 22]:
        suffix = "nd"
    elif day in [3, 23]:
        suffix = "rd"
    else:
        suffix = "th"
    
    return f"{day}{suffix}"

def main():
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month: "))
    day = int(input("Enter the day: "))
    
    print(f"The day of the month is: {get_day_of_month(year, month, day)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the year: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwksus1so.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwksus1so.py", line 25, in main
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2022-09-01'
