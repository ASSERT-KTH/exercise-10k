## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, then prints out the first and last elements of the list, as well as the sum of all elements in the list, excluding the first and last elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_list_info(lst):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers as input, then prints out the first and last elements of the list,
    as well as the sum of all elements in the list, excluding the first and last elements.
    """
    # Check if the list has at least one element
    if len(lst) < 1:
        print("The list is empty.")
        return
    
    # Print the first element of the list
    print("First element:", lst[0])
    
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(lst) < 2:
        print("The sum of elements (excluding first and last) is 0 since there's no middle elements.")
        return
    
    # Print the last element of the list
    print("Last element:", lst[-1])
    
    # Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the list, excluding the first and last elements
    sum_of_middle_elements = sum(lst[1:-1])
    print("Sum of middle elements:", sum_of_middle_elements)


# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_list_info(numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
First element: 1
Last element: 5
Sum of middle elements: 9
```
