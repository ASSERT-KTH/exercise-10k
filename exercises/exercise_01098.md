## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their greatest common divisor.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print("The GCD of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", gcd(num1, num2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp0kxc4z07.py", line 6, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 15'
```
