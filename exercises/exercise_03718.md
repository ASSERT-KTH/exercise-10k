## Exercise
Write a function that takes in two strings and returns the Hamming distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def hamming_distance(str1, str2):
    """
    Calculate the Hamming distance between two strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first string.
        str2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The Hamming distance between the two strings.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the strings are not of equal length.
    """
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        raise ValueError("Strings must be of equal length")

    return sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    str1 = "abcdef"
    str2 = "abcxyz"
    print(f"Hamming distance between '{str1}' and '{str2}': {hamming_distance(str1, str2)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Hamming distance between 'abcdef' and 'abcxyz': 3
```
