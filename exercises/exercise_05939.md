## Exercise
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])

    return fib_sequence


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_terms = 10
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:")
    print(fibonacci(num_terms))
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
