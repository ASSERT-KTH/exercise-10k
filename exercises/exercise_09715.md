## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the modular arithmetic operation (a mod b).

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    a = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
    c = a % b
    print("The result of the operation is:", c)

main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpakjz6i5e.py", line 7, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpakjz6i5e.py", line 2, in main
    a = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
```
