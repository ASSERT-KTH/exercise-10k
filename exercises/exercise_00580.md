## Exercise
Write a function that finds the characters that are in either the first string or the second string, but not in both.

## Reference Solution
```python
def exclusive_characters(str1, str2):
    """
    Finds the characters that are in either the first string or the second string, but not in both.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first string.
        str2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        set: A set of characters that are in either str1 or str2, but not in both.
    """
    # Convert the strings to sets of characters
    set1 = set(str1)
    set2 = set(str2)

    # Use the symmetric difference operation to find the exclusive characters
    exclusive = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

    return exclusive

# Example usage:
str1 = "abc"
str2 = "bcd"
print(exclusive_characters(str1, str2))  # Output: {'a', 'd'}
```

```python
def exclusive_characters(str1, str2):
    return set(str1) ^ set(str2)
```
