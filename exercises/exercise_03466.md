## Exercise
Write a program that asks for two numbers and an operator, and then prints out the result of the operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Get the numbers and operator from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    operator = input("Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Perform the operation based on the operator
    if operator == "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operator == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operator == "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operator == "/":
        # Check for division by zero
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
            return
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        print("Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.")
        return

    # Print the result
    print(f"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpm4sfo0yu.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpm4sfo0yu.py", line 3, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2, 3, +'
```
