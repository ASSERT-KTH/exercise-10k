## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Store the results in separate variables and print them.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the variables
a = 10
b = 2

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
div = a / b

# Print the results
print("Sum of a and b: ", sum)
print("Difference of a and b: ", sub)
print("Product of a and b: ", mul)
print("Quotient of a and b: ", div)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of a and b:  12
Difference of a and b:  8
Product of a and b:  20
Quotient of a and b:  5.0
```
