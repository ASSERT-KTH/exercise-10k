## Exercise
Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_substring(string, substring):
    """
    Counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The main string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the substring in the string.
    """
    count = start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos != -1:
            start = pos + 1
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_string = "Hello, world. Hello again."
    sub_string = "Hello"
    occurrences = count_substring(main_string, sub_string)
    print(f"'{sub_string}' occurs {occurrences} times in '{main_string}'")
```
