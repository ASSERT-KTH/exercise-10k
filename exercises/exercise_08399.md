## Exercise
Create a function that takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image. The mirror image of a matrix is obtained by reversing the order of columns. For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], the mirror image would be [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]. The function should work with matrices of any size.

## Reference Solution
```python
def mirror_image(matrix):
    """
    This function takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image.
    The mirror image of a matrix is obtained by reversing the order of columns.

    Args:
        matrix (list): A 2D list representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        list: The mirror image of the input matrix.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the mirror image of the matrix
    mirrored_matrix = []

    # Iterate over each row in the input matrix
    for row in matrix:
        # Reverse the order of elements in the current row and append it to the mirrored matrix
        # The reversed function returns a reversed iterator of the given sequence
        mirrored_matrix.append(list(reversed(row)))

    # Return the mirrored matrix
    return mirrored_matrix

# Example usage:
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(mirror_image(matrix))  # Output: [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
```

## Generated Output
```
[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
```
