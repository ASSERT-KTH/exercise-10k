## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result of the operation. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator):
    """
    This function performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.
    
    Parameters:
    num1 (int or float): The first number.
    num2 (int or float): The second number.
    operator (str): The arithmetic operation to be performed. It can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.

    Returns:
    int or float: The result of the arithmetic operation.
    """
    if operator == '+':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operator == '-':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operator == '*':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operator == '/':
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.")

# Example usage:
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
operator = '*'
result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator)
print(f"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
10 * 2 = 20
```
