## Exercise
Write a program to find the symmetric difference of two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the symmetric difference of two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The symmetric difference of arr1 and arr2.
    """
    # Convert input lists to sets
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)

    # Calculate symmetric difference using set operations
    symmetric_diff = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

    # Convert result back to list and return
    return list(symmetric_diff)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

    result = symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2)
    print("Symmetric difference:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Symmetric difference: [1, 2, 5, 6]
```
