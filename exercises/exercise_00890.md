## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their weight and height and prints out their BMI (body mass index) based on the following formula: BMI = weight / height^2. Print out a message indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    """
    Calculate the BMI based on the formula: BMI = weight / height^2
    """
    return weight / (height ** 2)

def get_weight_status(bmi):
    """
    Determine the weight status based on the BMI
    """
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "Underweight"
    elif bmi < 25:
        return "Normal weight"
    elif bmi < 30:
        return "Overweight"
    else:
        return "Obese"

def main():
    # Get user input
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
    height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

    # Calculate BMI
    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

    # Determine weight status
    weight_status = get_weight_status(bmi)

    # Print results
    print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
    print(f"Your weight status is: {weight_status}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpsinqtcrh.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpsinqtcrh.py", line 22, in main
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '70 1.75'
```
