## Exercise
Create a program that lets the user play a simple game and win or lose based on their input using if statements

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
        
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
            if play_again.lower() == "yes":
                game()
            else:
                print("Thanks for playing!")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game()
```

## Generated Output
```
