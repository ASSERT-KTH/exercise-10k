## Exercise
Write a program that asks for two strings and checks if the first string starts with the second string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_start():
    # Get two strings from the user
    str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

    # Check if the first string starts with the second string
    if str1.startswith(str2):
        print(f'"{str1}" starts with "{str2}"')
    else:
        print(f'"{str1}" does not start with "{str2}"')

check_start()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first string: Enter the second string: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwvjkgybc.py", line 12, in <module>
    check_start()
  File "/tmp/tmpwvjkgybc.py", line 4, in check_start
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
