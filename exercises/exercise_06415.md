## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a dice roll and prints out the result. Use if/else statements to determine the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def roll_dice():
    """
    Simulates a dice roll and returns the result.
    """
    roll = random.randint(1, 6)
    return roll

def determine_result(roll):
    """
    Determines the result of the dice roll using if/else statements.
    """
    if roll == 1:
        result = "You rolled a 1. Better luck next time!"
    elif roll == 2:
        result = "You rolled a 2. Not bad, but you can do better!"
    elif roll == 3:
        result = "You rolled a 3. Average roll."
    elif roll == 4:
        result = "You rolled a 4. Good roll!"
    elif roll == 5:
        result = "You rolled a 5. Excellent roll!"
    else:
        result = "You rolled a 6. Perfect roll! You got the highest number possible!"
    return result

def main():
    roll = roll_dice()
    result = determine_result(roll)
    print(f"You rolled a {roll}.")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
You rolled a 1.
You rolled a 1. Better luck next time!
```
