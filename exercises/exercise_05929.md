## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average value of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average value of the input list.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average value is: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
