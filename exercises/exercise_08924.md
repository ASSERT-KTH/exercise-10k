## Exercise
Write a program to check if a given number is an ugly number, where an ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_ugly(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is an ugly number.
    
    An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is ugly, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Divide the number by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it's divisible
    for divisor in [2, 3, 5]:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            n = n // divisor
    
    # If the number is reduced to 1, it's an ugly number
    return n == 1

# Example usage:
print(is_ugly(6))  # True
print(is_ugly(8))  # True
print(is_ugly(14))  # False
```

## Generated Output
```
True
True
False
```
