## Exercise
Create a function called fusion that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that combines their functionality. The new function should apply the first function to the input and then apply the second function to the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function called fusion that takes two functions as arguments.
def fusion(func1, func2):
    """
    This function combines the functionality of two input functions.
    
    It takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function. 
    The new function applies the first input function to the input and then applies the second input function to the result.

    Args:
        func1 (function): The first function to be applied.
        func2 (function): The second function to be applied.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that combines the functionality of func1 and func2.
    """

    # Define a new function inside the fusion function. This new function will be returned by fusion.
    def combined_function(*args, **kwargs):
        
        # Apply the first function to the input and store the result.
        result = func1(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Apply the second function to the result and return the final result.
        return func2(result)

    # Return the new combined function.
    return combined_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

combined = fusion(double, increment)
print(combined(5))  # Output: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
