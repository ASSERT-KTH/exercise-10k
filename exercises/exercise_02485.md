## Exercise
Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    print(f"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {gcd(num1, num2)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
GCD of 48 and 18: 6
```
