## Exercise
Write a program to find the minimum window of a string that contains all characters of another string

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s, t):
    """
    Find the minimum window of string `s` that contains all characters of string `t`.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search in.
    t (str): The string that must be contained in the window.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. If no such window exists, returns an empty string.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    t_count = Counter(t)
    required_chars = len(t_count)

    left = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    min_window = ""

    formed_chars = 0
    window_counts = {}

    for right in range(len(s)):
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed_chars += 1

        while left <= right and formed_chars == required_chars:
            character = s[left]

            if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                min_length = right - left + 1
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]

            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed_chars -= 1

            left += 1

    return min_window

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
    t = "ABC"
    print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
