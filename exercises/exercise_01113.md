## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    """
    Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.

    Args:
        base (float): The base of the triangle.
        height (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Base and height must be positive numbers")

    area = (base * height) / 2
    return area


def main():
    # Example usage
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

    try:
        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
        print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base of the triangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmxzwchow.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmxzwchow.py", line 21, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 6'
