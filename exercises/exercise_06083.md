## Exercise
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(f"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}")
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(f"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
