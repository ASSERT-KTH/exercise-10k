## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array as input, and returns its sorted version using a merge sort algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array.
    """
    # Base case: If the array has 1 or 0 elements, it is already sorted.
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Find the middle point of the array.
    mid = len(arr) // 2

    # Divide the array into two halves.
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    # Recursively sort the two halves.
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    # Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
    return merge(left_half, right_half)


def merge(left, right):
    """
    Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

    Args:
        left (list): The first sorted array.
        right (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        list: The merged sorted array.
    """
    merged = []
    left_index = 0
    right_index = 0

    # Merge smaller elements first.
    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:
            merged.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    # If there are remaining elements in either the left or the right array, append them to the merged array.
    merged.extend(left[left_index:])
    merged.extend(right[right_index:])

    return merged


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
    print("Original array:", arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
