## Exercise
Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and outputs the distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

# Get the coordinates of the two points from the user
x1, y1 = map(float, input("Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1): ").split(','))
x2, y2 = map(float, input("Enter the coordinates of the second point (x2, y2): ").split(','))

# Calculate the differences between the corresponding coordinates
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1

# Calculate the distance between the two points using the distance formula
distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

# Print the result
print("The distance between the two points is:", distance)

# Example usage
# Input: (2, 2), (4, 4)
# Output: The distance between the two points is: 2.8284271247461903
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpfrqdt5p0.py", line 4, in <module>
    x1, y1 = map(float, input("Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1): ").split(','))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 4 6'
