## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to simulate rolling a dice n times, and then prints the frequency of each outcome.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def roll_dice(n):
    """
    Simulates rolling a dice n times and prints the frequency of each outcome.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of times to roll the dice.
    """
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each outcome
    frequency = {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0}

    # Simulate rolling the dice n times
    for _ in range(n):
        # Roll the dice (generate a random number between 1 and 6)
        roll = random.randint(1, 6)
        # Increment the frequency of the current outcome
        frequency[roll] += 1

    # Print the frequency of each outcome
    print("Outcome\tFrequency")
    for outcome, count in frequency.items():
        print(f"{outcome}\t{count}")

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of times to roll the dice: "))
roll_dice(n)
```

```python
import random
from collections import Counter

def roll_dice(n):
    rolls = random.choices(range(1, 7), k=n)
    frequency = Counter(rolls)
    print("Outcome\tFrequency")
    for outcome, count in frequency.items():
        print(f"{outcome}\t{count}")

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of times to roll the dice: "))
roll_dice(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of times to roll the dice: Outcome	Frequency
1	3
2	1
3	2
4	1
5	2
6	1
```
