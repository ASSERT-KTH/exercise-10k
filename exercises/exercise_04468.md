## Exercise
Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_occurrences(lst, target):
    """
    Counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to search in.
        target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.
    """
    count = 0
    for element in lst:
        if element == target:
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    # Example usage
    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
    target = 2
    occurrences = count_occurrences(lst, target)
    print(f"The element {target} occurs {occurrences} times in the list.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The element 2 occurs 4 times in the list.
```
