## Exercise
Write a function that recursively traverses a data structure, such as a tree or graph, and performs an operation on each node.

## Reference Solution
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def traverse(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.val)  # Perform an operation on the node
    traverse(root.left)  # Recursively traverse the left child
    traverse(root.right)  # Recursively traverse the right child
```

## Generated Output
```
