## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    guess = None
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")

    while guess != number_to_guess:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        guess = input("Take a guess: ")

        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        if not guess.isdigit():
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue

        # Convert the input to an integer
        guess = int(guess)

        # Increment the attempt counter
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")

    print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
Take a guess: Too low!
Take a guess: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpt9h09zbw.py", line 36, in <module>
    guess_number()
  File "/tmp/tmpt9h09zbw.py", line 14, in guess_number
    guess = input("Take a guess: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
