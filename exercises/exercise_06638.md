## Exercise
Create a function that uses debugging to step through its execution and inspect variables

## Reference Solution
```python
import pdb

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers in the list.
    """
    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugging from here
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
> /tmp/tmp7of8q0no.py(14)calculate_sum()
-> total = 0
(Pdb) 5
(Pdb) 

Traceback (most recent call last):
