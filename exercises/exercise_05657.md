## Exercise
Write a function that checks if a given number is within a specified range.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_number_in_range(number, min_value, max_value):
    """
    Checks if a given number is within a specified range.

    Args:
        number (int): The number to be checked.
        min_value (int): The minimum value of the range (inclusive).
        max_value (int): The maximum value of the range (inclusive).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the number is greater than or equal to the minimum value
    # This is because the range is inclusive, meaning it includes the minimum value
    is_greater_than_min = number >= min_value
    
    # Next, we need to check if the number is less than or equal to the maximum value
    # This is because the range is inclusive, meaning it includes the maximum value
    is_less_than_max = number <= max_value
    
    # Finally, we return True if both conditions are met, and False otherwise
    # This is done using the 'and' operator, which returns True only if both conditions are True
    return is_greater_than_min and is_less_than_max

# Example usage:
print(check_number_in_range(5, 1, 10))  # Returns: True
print(check_number_in_range(15, 1, 10))  # Returns: False
```

## Generated Output
```
True
False
```
