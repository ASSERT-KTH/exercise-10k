## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.
    """
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1

    # Print the first n Fibonacci numbers
    for i in range(n):
        print(a, end=' ')
        # Update a and b for the next iteration
        a, b = b, a + b

# Test the function
n = 10  # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
print_fibonacci(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
