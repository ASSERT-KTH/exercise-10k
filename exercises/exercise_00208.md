## Exercise
Write a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose_functions(f, g):
    """
    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.
    
    The composition of two functions f and g is a new function that first applies g and then applies f to the result.
    
    :param f: The first function to be applied in the composition.
    :param g: The second function to be applied in the composition.
    :return: A new function that is the composition of f and g.
    """

    # We define a new function that will be the composition of f and g
    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):
        
        # First, we apply g to the arguments
        intermediate_result = g(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Then, we apply f to the result of g
        final_result = f(intermediate_result)
        
        # Finally, we return the final result
        return final_result
    
    # We return the composed function
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

composited = compose_functions(add_one, double)
print(composited(5))  # Outputs: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
