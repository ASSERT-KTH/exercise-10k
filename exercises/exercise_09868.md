## Exercise
Write a program that responds to basic user input with predefined responses.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary with user inputs as keys and responses as values
responses = {
    "hello": "Hi, how are you?",
    "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks!",
    "what's your name": "I'm a chatbot, nice to meet you!",
    "goodbye": "See you later, have a great day!",
    "help": "I can understand the following commands: hello, how are you, what's your name, goodbye"
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """Returns a predefined response based on the user's input"""
    user_input = user_input.lower()  # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    return responses.get(user_input, "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Type 'help' for available commands.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'help' for available commands.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        response = get_response(user_input)
        print("Chatbot:", response)
        if user_input.lower() == "goodbye":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'help' for available commands.
You: Chatbot: Hi, how are you?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxwplib_i.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpxwplib_i.py", line 18, in main
    user_input = input("You: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
