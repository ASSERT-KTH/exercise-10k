## Exercise
Create a function that uses generators to produce a sequence of numbers. Then, call this function with an input value and print the generated sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(n):
    """
    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers from 0 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.
    
    Yields:
        int: The next number in the sequence.
    """
    for i in range(n + 1):
        yield i

def main():
    n = 10  # Input value
    print(f"Generated sequence for n = {n}:")
    for num in generate_sequence(n):
        print(num, end=" ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Generated sequence for n = 10:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
