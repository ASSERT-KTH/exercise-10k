## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary as an input and returns a new dictionary with the keys and values inverted. If there are duplicate values in the original dictionary, the function should return the last key that corresponds to each value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def invert_dict(input_dict):
    """
    Inverts a dictionary, returning a new dictionary with the keys and values inverted.
    If there are duplicate values in the original dictionary, the function returns the last key that corresponds to each value.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be inverted.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the keys and values inverted.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inverted key-value pairs
    inverted_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # For each pair, update the inverted dictionary with the value as the key and the key as the value
        # This will overwrite any existing key with the same value, effectively keeping the last key that corresponds to each value
        inverted_dict[value] = key

    # Return the inverted dictionary
    return inverted_dict
```
