## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a key function as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct values returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements that correspond to each key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def group_by_key(lst, key):
    """
    This function takes a list and a key function as input, 
    and returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct values 
    returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements 
    that correspond to each key.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        key (function): The key function.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the distinct values 
        returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements 
        that correspond to each key.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped elements
    grouped_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in lst:
        # Calculate the key for the current element using the key function
        k = key(element)
        
        # If the calculated key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value
        if k not in grouped_dict:
            # This is done to avoid a KeyError when trying to append to a non-existent key
            grouped_dict[k] = []
        
        # Append the current element to the list of elements corresponding to its key
        grouped_dict[k].append(element)
    
    # Return the dictionary with the grouped elements
    return grouped_dict

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

print(group_by_key(numbers, is_even))  # Output: {False: [1, 3, 5], True: [2, 4, 6]}
```

## Generated Output
```
{False: [1, 3, 5], True: [2, 4, 6]}
```
