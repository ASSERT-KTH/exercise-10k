## Exercise
Create a program that takes the temperature as input and checks if it's hot, cold, or mild using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_temperature(temp):
    """
    Checks the temperature and returns if it's hot, cold, or mild.

    Args:
        temp (float): The temperature in Celsius.

    Returns:
        str: A string indicating if the temperature is hot, cold, or mild.
    """
    if temp < 10:
        return "Cold"
    elif 10 <= temp <= 25:
        return "Mild"
    else:
        return "Hot"


def main():
    # Get the temperature from the user
    temp = float(input("Enter the temperature in Celsius: "))

    # Check the temperature
    result = check_temperature(temp)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The temperature is {result}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in Celsius: The temperature is Mild.
```
