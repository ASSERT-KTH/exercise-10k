## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a simple banking system and allows users to deposit and withdraw money using if statements

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a class for the bank account
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    # Method to deposit money
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. Current balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    # Method to withdraw money
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            if amount <= self.balance:
                self.balance -= amount
                print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. Current balance: ${self.balance}")
            else:
                print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    # Method to check the balance
    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance}")

# Main function to simulate the banking system
def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nSimple Banking System")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the banking system. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Simple Banking System
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Enter your choice: Invalid choice. Please try again.

Simple Banking System
