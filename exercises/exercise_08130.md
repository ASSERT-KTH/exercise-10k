## Exercise
Create a program that generates a number sequence using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence
    a, b = 0, 1

    # Create a list to store the sequence
    sequence = []

    # Loop through the sequence
    for i in range(n):
        # Append the current term to the sequence
        sequence.append(a)

        # Calculate the next term using if/else statements
        if i == 0:
            a, b = 0, 1
        else:
            a, b = b, a + b

    return sequence


# Test the function
n = 10
print("Fibonacci sequence up to {} terms:".format(n))
print(generate_fibonacci(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
```
