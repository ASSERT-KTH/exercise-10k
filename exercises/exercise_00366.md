## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Arithmetic Operation Program

# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, op):
    # Define a dictionary to map operator symbols to their corresponding functions
    operations = {
        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,
        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,
        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,
        '/': lambda x, y: x / y
    }

    # Check if the operator is valid
    if op in operations:
        # Perform the operation and return the result
        return operations[op](num1, num2)
    else:
        # Return an error message if the operator is invalid
        return "Invalid operator"

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
op = "+"

result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, op)
print(f"{num1} {op} {num2} = {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
10 + 5 = 15
```
