## Exercise
Write a program that takes the total cost of a meal and a tip percentage as input and outputs the total amount to pay.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the total amount to pay for a meal given the meal cost and tip percentage.

    Args:
        meal_cost (float): The total cost of the meal.
        tip_percentage (float): The percentage of the meal cost to use as a tip.

    Returns:
        float: The total amount to pay.
    """
    # Convert the tip percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100
    tip_decimal = tip_percentage / 100
    
    # Calculate the tip amount
    tip_amount = meal_cost * tip_decimal
    
    # Calculate the total amount to pay
    total_amount = meal_cost + tip_amount
    
    return total_amount

def main():
    # Get the meal cost and tip percentage from the user
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the total cost of the meal: $"))
    tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%): "))

    # Calculate and display the total amount to pay
    total_amount = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)
    print(f"The total amount to pay is: ${total_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total cost of the meal: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp189f_btu.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp189f_btu.py", line 25, in main
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the total cost of the meal: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 15'
