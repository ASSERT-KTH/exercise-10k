## Exercise
Create a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Get the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: ").lower()
        if user_choice == 'q':
            break
        if user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```

Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: paper

Computer wins!
