## Exercise
Create a program that takes an integer as input and prints out the sum of all numbers from 1 to the input number using a for loop. Then, use a while loop to print out the sum of all numbers from the input number down to 1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum(input_num):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, input_num + 1):
        total += i
    print(total)

def sum2(input_num):
    total = 0
    i = input_num
    while i != 0:
        total += i
        i -= 1
    print(total)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum(num)
sum2(num)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 15
15
```
