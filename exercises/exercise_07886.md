## Exercise
Create a program that implements a basic calculator. It should take a string input representing a mathematical operation, such as '2 + 3' or '5 * 2', and output the result of that operation. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(operation):
    try:
        return eval(operation)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

def main():
    print("Basic Calculator")
    print("Operations supported: +, -, *, /")
    while True:
        operation = input("Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if operation.lower() == 'q':
            break
        print(f"Result: {calculate(operation)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
import numexpr as ne

def calculate(operation):
    try:
        return ne.evaluate(operation)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

def main():
    print("Basic Calculator")
    print("Operations supported: +, -, *, /")
    while True:
        operation = input("Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if operation.lower() == 'q':
            break
        print(f"Result: {calculate(operation)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
from asteval import Interpreter

def calculate(operation):
    aeval = Interpreter()
    try:
        return aeval(operation)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

def main():
    print("Basic Calculator")
    print("Operations supported: +, -, *, /")
    while True:
        operation = input("Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if operation.lower() == 'q':
            break
        print(f"Result: {calculate(operation)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
