## Exercise
Given an array of integers and a number k, find the minimum possible maximum difference between any two elements in the array after adding k to each element. The function should take in an array of integers and a number k as input and return the minimum possible maximum difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_max_diff(arr, k):
    """
    This function calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between any two elements in the array after adding k to each element.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A list of integers.
    k (int): The number to be added to each element in the array.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum possible maximum difference.
    """
    
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    # First, we sort the array in ascending order
    arr.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum and maximum values with the first and last elements of the sorted array
    # We add k to each element because the problem states that we need to add k to each element
    min_val = arr[0] + k
    max_val = arr[-1] + k
    
    # The minimum possible maximum difference is the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    # We use the built-in max and min functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array
    # However, since we have already sorted the array, we can directly use the first and last elements
    min_max_diff = max_val - min_val
    
    # Return the minimum possible maximum difference
    return min_max_diff

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 5, 10, 15]
k = 2
print(min_max_diff(arr, k))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
14
