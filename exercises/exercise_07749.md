## Exercise
Create a program that takes an integer score as input and evaluates it based on the following conditions: if the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'; if the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'; if the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'; if the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), the grade is 'D'; and if the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'. The program should output the corresponding grade for the given score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary to map score ranges to grades
grades = {
    'A': lambda score: score >= 90,
    'B': lambda score: 80 <= score <= 89,
    'C': lambda score: 70 <= score <= 79,
    'D': lambda score: 60 <= score <= 69,
    'F': lambda score: score < 60
}

# Define a function to evaluate a score and return the corresponding grade
def evaluate_grade(score):
    for grade, condition in grades.items():
        if condition(score):
            return grade

# Define a main function to test the evaluate_grade function
def main():
    score = 75
    grade = evaluate_grade(score)
    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

# Call the main function to test the program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Score: 75, Grade: C
```
