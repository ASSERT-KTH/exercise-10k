## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary as input and calculates the total value of all items, assuming each key-value pair represents an item name and its corresponding price. The program should also find the item with the maximum price and the item with the minimum price.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_item_total(items):
    # Calculate total value of all items
    total = sum(items.values())

    # Find item with maximum price
    max_key = max(items, key=items.get)

    # Find item with minimum price
    min_key = min(items, key=items.get)

    return total, max_key, min_key

# Example usage
items = {"item1": 10, "item2": 20, "item3": 30, "item4": 40, "item5": 50}
total, max_key, min_key = calculate_item_total(items)

print(f"Total value of all items: {total}")
print(f"Item with maximum price: {max_key}")
print(f"Item with minimum price: {min_key}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Total value of all items: 150
Item with maximum price: item5
Item with minimum price: item1
```
