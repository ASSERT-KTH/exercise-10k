## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the given score.
    
    Args:
    score (float): The student's score.
    
    Returns:
    str: The corresponding grade.
    """
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
        return "D"
    elif score < 60:
        return "F"
    else:
        return "Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100."

def main():
    # Take the score as input from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
            if score < 0 or score > 100:
                print("Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
