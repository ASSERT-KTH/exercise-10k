## Exercise
Create two dictionaries with names of countries as keys and their capitals as values. Calculate the union of the two dictionaries and print the resulting dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dict_union(dict1, dict2):
    """
    Calculate the union of two dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
    """
    return {**dict1, **dict2}

# Define the dictionaries
countries_dict1 = {
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Italy": "Rome"
}

countries_dict2 = {
    "Spain": "Madrid",
    "Portugal": "Lisbon",
    "Germany": "Munich"  # Note: This will override the value in dict1
}

# Calculate the union of the dictionaries
result_dict = dict_union(countries_dict1, countries_dict2)

# Print the resulting dictionary
print("Dictionary Union:")
for country, capital in result_dict.items():
    print(f"{country}: {capital}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Dictionary Union:
France: Paris
Germany: Munich
Italy: Rome
Spain: Madrid
Portugal: Lisbon
```
