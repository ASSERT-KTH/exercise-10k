## Exercise
Write a program that asks a user to take a simple survey and prints the result. The survey should ask the user to rate their satisfaction (1-5) and print whether they are satisfied (4-5) or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
def survey():
    """
    Asks the user to rate their satisfaction and prints the result.
    """
    print("Simple Satisfaction Survey")
    print("--------------------------------")

    # Ask the user for their satisfaction rating
    while True:
        try:
            rating = int(input("Please rate your satisfaction (1-5): "))
            if 1 <= rating <= 5:
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid rating. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Print the result
    if rating >= 4:
        print(f"You are satisfied with a rating of {rating}.")
    else:
        print(f"You are not satisfied with a rating of {rating}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    survey()
```
