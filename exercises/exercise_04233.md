    if income <= 10000:
        return 0
    elif income <= 20000:
        return (income - 10000) * 0.10
    elif income <= 50000:
        return (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 20000) * 0.15)
    else:
        return (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + ((income - 50000) * 0.20)

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
    tax = calculate_tax(income)
    print(f"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}")
    print(f"Your net income is: ${income - tax:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
