## Exercise
Ask the user for the coordinates of two points and print the distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)
        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)

    Returns:
        float: Distance between the two points
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)

def main():
    # Ask the user for the coordinates of the two points
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Create tuples to represent the points
    point1 = (x1, y1)
    point2 = (x2, y2)

    # Calculate and print the distance
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
    print(f"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpc2otf4k5.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpc2otf4k5.py", line 20, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 4 6'
