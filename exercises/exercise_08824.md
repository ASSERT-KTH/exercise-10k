## Exercise
Write a function that takes an array and a number of positions as input, and returns the array rotated to the right by the given number of positions. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number of positions is 2, the output should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(arr, num_positions):
    """
    Rotate the array to the right by the given number of positions.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array.
        num_positions (int): The number of positions to rotate.

    Returns:
        list: The rotated array.
    """
    # Handle edge cases where the array is empty or the number of positions is 0
    if not arr or num_positions == 0:
        return arr

    # Calculate the effective number of positions to rotate, considering the length of the array
    effective_positions = num_positions % len(arr)

    # Split the array into two parts: the last 'effective_positions' elements and the rest
    # Then, concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation effect
    rotated_arr = arr[-effective_positions:] + arr[:-effective_positions]

    return rotated_arr

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
num_positions = 2
print(rotate_array(arr, num_positions))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
