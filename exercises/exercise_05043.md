## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.

    Args:
    - dividend (int): The number being divided.
    - divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")

    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor

    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    # Get user input
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    try:
        # Calculate quotient and remainder
        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)

        # Print results
        print(f"Quotient: {quotient}")
        print(f"Remainder: {remainder}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmc6jj22j.py", line 38, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmc6jj22j.py", line 23, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
