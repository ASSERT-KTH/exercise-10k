```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object.

        Args:
            initial_balance (float): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount cannot be negative")
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the current balance.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount cannot be negative")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Displays the current account balance.
        """
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000
    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check balance")
        print("4. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == "1":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
                account.deposit(amount)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "2":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
                account.withdraw(amount)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
