## Exercise
Create a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "tie"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "user"
    return "computer"

def main():
    """Main game loop"""
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'quit' to exit: ").lower()
        if user_choice == "quit":
            break
        if user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == "tie":
            print(f"It's a tie!")
        elif winner == "user":
            print(f"You win this round!")
            user_score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Computer wins this round!")
            computer_score += 1
        print(f"Score - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\n")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'quit' to exit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: rock

It's a tie!
Score - You: 0, Computer: 0

Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'quit' to exit:
