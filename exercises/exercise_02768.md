## Exercise
Write a program that takes a word as input and lets the user guess the word by suggesting letters.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def word_guessing_game(word, attempts=6):
    """
    Word guessing game function.

    Args:
    word (str): The word to be guessed.
    attempts (int): The number of attempts the user has. Defaults to 6.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the user guessed the word, False otherwise.
