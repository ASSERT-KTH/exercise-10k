## Exercise
Write a program to ask the user for two points in 2D space and calculate the distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The first point as a tuple of two numbers (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The second point as a tuple of two numbers (x, y).

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)

def main():
    # Ask the user for the first point
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))

    # Ask the user for the second point
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    point1 = (x1, y1)
    point2 = (x2, y2)
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The distance between the points ({x1}, {y1}) and ({x2}, {y2}) is: {distance:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwesyk6td.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwesyk6td.py", line 20, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 3 4'
