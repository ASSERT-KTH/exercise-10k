## Exercise
Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in three parameters: student_name, assignment_score, and exam_score. The function should calculate the student's final grade based on the assignment score (30% of the final grade) and the exam score (70% of the final grade). The function should return a string that includes the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(student_name, assignment_score, exam_score):
    """
    This function calculates the student's final grade based on their assignment score and exam score.

    Parameters:
    student_name (str): The name of the student.
    assignment_score (float): The score of the assignment.
    exam_score (float): The score of the exam.

    Returns:
    str: A string containing the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.
    """

    # First, we need to calculate the weight of the assignment score in the final grade, which is 30%.
    # We multiply the assignment score by 0.3 to get the weighted assignment score.
    weighted_assignment_score = assignment_score * 0.3
    
    # Next, we need to calculate the weight of the exam score in the final grade, which is 70%.
    # We multiply the exam score by 0.7 to get the weighted exam score.
    weighted_exam_score = exam_score * 0.7
    
    # Now, we can calculate the final grade by adding the weighted assignment score and the weighted exam score.
    final_grade = weighted_assignment_score + weighted_exam_score
    
    # Finally, we return a string that includes the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.
    # We use the format function to insert the student's name and their final grade into the string.
    # We also round the final grade to two decimal places for better readability.
    return "{}'s final grade is {:.2f}%".format(student_name, final_grade)
