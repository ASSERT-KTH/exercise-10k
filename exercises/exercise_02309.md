## Exercise
Write a program that generates a Mad Libs story based on user input. The program should ask the user for a noun, verb, adjective, etc. and then print out the completed story.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

def get_user_input():
    """
    Asks the user for input and returns a dictionary with the input values.
    """
    inputs = {
        "noun": input("Enter a noun: "),
        "verb": input("Enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): "),
        "adjective": input("Enter an adjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): "),
        "adverb": input("Enter an adverb (e.g., quickly, loudly, wisely): "),
        "place": input("Enter a place: "),
        "person": input("Enter a person's name: ")
    }
    return inputs

def generate_story(inputs):
    """
    Generates a Mad Libs story based on the user input.
    """
    story = f"One day, {inputs['person']} was walking through the {inputs['adjective']} forest when they stumbled upon a {inputs['noun']}. " \
            f"They decided to {inputs['verb']} {inputs['adverb']} towards the {inputs['place']}. " \
            f"As they approached, they noticed that the {inputs['noun']} was actually a magical {inputs['noun']} that granted wishes. " \
            f"{inputs['person']} was overjoyed and wished for a {inputs['adjective']} {inputs['noun']} to appear. And to their surprise, it did!"
    return story

def main():
    """
    The main function that runs the program.
    """
    print("Welcome to the Mad Libs story generator!")
    inputs = get_user_input()
    story = generate_story(inputs)
    print("\nHere's your completed Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Mad Libs story generator!
Enter a noun: Enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpa33flt9s.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpa33flt9s.py", line 33, in main
    inputs = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpa33flt9s.py", line 10, in get_user_input
    "verb": input("Enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): "),
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
