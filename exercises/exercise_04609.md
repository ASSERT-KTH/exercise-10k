## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}")

    # Alternative method using math.gcd()
    gcd_math = math.gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} (using math.gcd()) is: {gcd_math}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6
The GCD of 48 and 18 (using math.gcd()) is: 6
```
