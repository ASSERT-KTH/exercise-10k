## Exercise
Write a program to ask the user a series of questions and print out a personalized message based on their answers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to get user input and print a personalized message
def get_user_input():
    # Ask the user for their name
    name = input("What is your name? ")

    # Ask the user for their favorite color
    favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

    # Ask the user for their favorite hobby
    favorite_hobby = input("What is your favorite hobby? ")

    # Ask the user for their age
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))

    # Print a personalized message based on the user's answers
    print("\nHello, " + name + "! It's great to meet you.")
    print("I heard that " + favorite_color + " is a great color. It really suits you!")
    print("It's awesome that you enjoy " + favorite_hobby + ". You must be very talented.")
    if age < 18:
        print("You're still young and have your whole life ahead of you. Keep exploring and learning new things!")
    elif age < 65:
        print("You're in the prime of your life. Keep working hard and pursuing your passions!")
    else:
        print("You've lived a long and fulfilling life. Enjoy your retirement and spend time with loved ones!")

# Call the function to get user input and print a personalized message
get_user_input()
```

## Generated Output
```
What is your name? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite hobby? How old are you?
