## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list of lists where the elements are transposed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose(list_of_lists):
    """
    Transpose a list of lists.

    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists to be transposed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list of lists where the elements are transposed.
    """
    return list(map(list, zip(*list_of_lists)))

# Example usage:
def main():
    # Define a list of lists
    list_of_lists = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    # Transpose the list of lists
    transposed = transpose(list_of_lists)

    # Print the original and transposed lists
    print("Original List:")
    for row in list_of_lists:
        print(row)

    print("\nTransposed List:")
    for row in transposed:
        print(row)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Transposed List:
[1, 4, 7]
[2, 5, 8]
[3, 6, 9]
```
