## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input, validates if the age is within the range of 1 to 100, and then outputs a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is not within the valid range, output an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 1 and age <= 100:
    print(f"Hello {name} you are {age} years old.")
else:
    print("Invalid age.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpe8_8ms9n.py", line 2, in <module>
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
