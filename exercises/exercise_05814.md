## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to manage a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    for i in range(5):
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: $"))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: $"))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

        if i == 4:
            print("Maximum number of transactions reached. Exiting program.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output

Bank Account Menu:
1. Deposit

3. Check Balance
4. Exit
