## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements (if/else) to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the student's score
score = float(input("Enter your score: "))

# Determine the grade
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Print the grade
print("Your grade is", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is B
```
