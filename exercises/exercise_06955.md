## Exercise
Create a function that takes the length, width, and height of a box as arguments and returns its volume.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_box_volume(length, width, height):
    """
    Calculate the volume of a box.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the box.
        width (float): The width of the box.
        height (float): The height of the box.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the box.
    """

    # First, we need to check if all the arguments are numbers, 
    # because we can't calculate the volume with non-numeric values.
    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)) or not isinstance(height, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("All arguments must be numbers.")

    # Now, we can calculate the volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.
    # This is based on the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is V = lwh.
    volume = length * width * height

    # Finally, we return the calculated volume.
    return volume
```
