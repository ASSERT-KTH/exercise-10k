## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a function as input and applies the function to each element of the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function(lst, func):
    """
    Applies a given function to each element of a list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list of elements to apply the function to.
        func (function): The function to apply to each element.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with the function applied to each element.
    """
    return [func(x) for x in lst]


# Example usage:
def square(x):
    """Returns the square of a number."""
    return x ** 2


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = apply_function(numbers, square)
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
