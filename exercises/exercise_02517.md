## Exercise
Write a program that takes the amount and exchange rate as input, and returns the converted amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate):
    """
    Converts an amount from one currency to another based on the given exchange rate.

    Args:
        amount (float): The amount to convert.
        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate to use for the conversion.

    Returns:
        float: The converted amount.
    """
    return amount * exchange_rate

def main():
    # Get user input
    amount = float(input("Enter the amount to convert: "))
    exchange_rate = float(input("Enter the exchange rate: "))

    # Convert the amount
    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate)

    # Print the result
    print(f"{amount} converted to the target currency is: {converted_amount}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount to convert: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5yveiopt.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp5yveiopt.py", line 16, in main
    amount = float(input("Enter the amount to convert: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 1.2'
```
