## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank account using a while loop. The program should allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Bank Account Simulator

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: $"))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: $"))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Thank you for using the bank account simulator. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
