## Exercise
Write a program to partition an array into two or more sub-arrays based on a condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_array(array, condition):
    """
    Partition an array into two or more sub-arrays based on a condition.

    Args:
    - array (list): The input array to be partitioned.
    - condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary where the keys are the conditions and the values are the corresponding sub-arrays.
    """
    result = {}
    for element in array:
        key = condition(element)
        if key not in result:
            result[key] = []
        result[key].append(element)
    return result

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Partition the array into even and odd numbers
    def is_even(x):
        return x % 2 == 0

    partitioned = partition_array(numbers, is_even)
    print("Even numbers:", partitioned[True])
    print("Odd numbers:", partitioned[False])

    # Partition the array into numbers greater than 5 and less than or equal to 5
    def is_greater_than_5(x):
        return x > 5

    partitioned = partition_array(numbers, is_greater_than_5)
    print("Numbers greater than 5:", partitioned[True])
    print("Numbers less than or equal to 5:", partitioned[False])
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Numbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Numbers less than or equal to 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
