## Exercise
Create a program that takes a number as input and returns the number of factors it has.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_factors(n):
    """
    Returns the number of factors of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to find factors for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of factors.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            # If i is a factor, n//i is also a factor
            if i * i == n:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    return count

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    factors = count_factors(num)
    print(f"The number {num} has {factors} factors.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The number 12 has 6 factors.
```
