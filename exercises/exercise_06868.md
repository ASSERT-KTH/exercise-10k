## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), score < 60 (F).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Version: 1.0
# Description: A program to determine the grade based on a given score.

def determine_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
grade = determine_grade(score)
print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
