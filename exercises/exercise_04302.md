## Exercise
Write a function that takes two numbers and an operator as input and returns the result of the operation

## Reference Solution
```python
def math_operation(num1, num2, operator):
    """
    Performs a basic arithmetic operation on two numbers.

    Args:
    num1 (float): The first number.
    num2 (float): The second number.
    operator (str): The arithmetic operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'.

    Returns:
    float: The result of the operation.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the operator is not supported.
    ZeroDivisionError: If division by zero is attempted.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding functions
    operations = {
        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,
        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,
        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,
        '/': lambda x, y: x / y
    }

    # Check if the operator is supported
    if operator not in operations:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported operator: {operator}")

    # Perform the operation
    try:
        result = operations[operator](num1, num2)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")

    return result


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0
```

## Generated Output
```
12
8
20
5.0
```
