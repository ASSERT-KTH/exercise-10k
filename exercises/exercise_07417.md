## Exercise
Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns the corresponding grade. The grade is calculated based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not a number or is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade for the given score.
    """

    # First, we check if the input score is not a number
    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("The input score must be a number.")

    # Then, we check if the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        raise ValueError("The input score must be between 0 and 100.")

    # Now, we calculate the grade based on the given scale
    # If the score is between 90 and 100, the grade is A
    if 90 <= score <= 100:
        return "A"
    
    # If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return "B"
    
    # If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return "C"
    
    # If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return "D"
    
    # If the score is below 60, the grade is F
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function
print(calculate_grade(95))  # Output: A
print(calculate_grade(85))  # Output: B
print(calculate_grade(75))  # Output: C
print(calculate_grade(65))  # Output: D
print(calculate_grade(55))  # Output: F
```
