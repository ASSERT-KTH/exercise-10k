## Exercise
Write a higher-order function that takes a function and a list of numbers as input and applies the function to each number in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function(func, numbers):
    """
    Applies a given function to each number in a list.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to be applied.
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of results after applying the function to each number.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []

    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Apply the function to the current number and append the result to the list
        results.append(func(num))

    # Return the list of results
    return results

# Example usage:
def square(x):
    # A simple function that squares a number
    return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(apply_function(square, numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
