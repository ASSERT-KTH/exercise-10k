## Exercise
Write a program that takes a nested list as input and returns a flat list containing all the elements from the nested list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a nested list as input and returns a flat list containing all the elements from the nested list.
    
    Args:
        nested_list (list): A list that may contain other lists.
    
    Returns:
        list: A flat list containing all the elements from the nested list.
    """
    flat_list = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            # If the element is a list, recursively call the flatten function on it and extend the flat list with the result.
            flat_list.extend(flatten(element))
        else:
            # If the element is not a list, append it to the flat list.
            flat_list.append(element)
    return flat_list

# Example usage:
nested_list = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7, [8, 9]]
print("Nested list:", nested_list)
print("Flat list:", flatten(nested_list))
```

## Generated Output
```
Nested list: [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7, [8, 9]]
Flat list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
