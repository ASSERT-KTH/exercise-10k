## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the user is under 13, print 'You are a kid'; if the user is between 13 and 19, print 'You are a teenager'; if the user is 20 or older, print 'You are an adult'

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_age_message():
    # Ask the user for their age
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Print a message based on the user's age
    if age < 13:
        print("You are a kid")
    elif 13 <= age <= 19:
        print("You are a teenager")
    else:
        print("You are an adult")

# Run the function
print_age_message()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your age: You are an adult
```
