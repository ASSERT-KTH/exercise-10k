## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice and determine the winner based on the user's input.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def game():
    user = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissor): ").lower()
    while user not in ["rock", "paper", "scissor"]:
        user = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissor: ").lower()

    possible_choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissor"]
    computer = random.choice(possible_choices)
    print(f"\nYou chose {user}, computer chose {computer}.\n")

    if user == computer:
        print(f"Both players selected {user}. It's a tie!")
    elif user == "rock":
        if computer == "scissor":
            print("Rock smashes scissor! You win!")
        else:
            print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user == "paper":
        if computer == "rock":
            print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
        else:
            print("Scissor cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user == "scissor":
        if computer == "paper":
            print("Scissor cuts paper! You win!")
        else:
            print("Rock smashes scissor! You lose.")

game()
```

## Generated Output
