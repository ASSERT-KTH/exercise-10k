## Exercise
Create a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and returns the distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
    
    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.
    
    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

def main():
    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Calculate and print the distance
    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print(f"The distance between the two points is: {distance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6mtrggdn.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6mtrggdn.py", line 20, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 4 6'
```
