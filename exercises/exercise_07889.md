## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a dictionary with the student names as keys and their grades as values, but only include students who have a grade above 80.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_students(grades):
    """
    This function filters a dictionary of student grades and returns a new dictionary 
    with only the students who have a grade above 80.

    Args:
        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with student names as keys and their grades as values, 
        but only includes students with a grade above 80.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students
    filtered_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary
    for student, grade in grades.items():
        # Check if the student's grade is above 80
        if grade > 80:
            # If the grade is above 80, add the student to the filtered dictionary
            filtered_grades[student] = grade

    # Return the filtered dictionary
    return filtered_grades

# Example usage:
grades = {
    'John': 85,
    'Alice': 70,
    'Bob': 90,
    'Charlie': 75,
    'David': 95
}

print(filter_students(grades))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 85, 'Bob': 90, 'David': 95}
```
