## Exercise
Create a program that uses nested for loops to print a matrix of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_matrix(rows, cols):
    """
    Prints a matrix of numbers with the given number of rows and columns.
    
    Args:
        rows (int): The number of rows in the matrix.
        cols (int): The number of columns in the matrix.
    """
    num = 1
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            print(f"{num:4d}", end="")  # Print the number with a width of 4 digits
            num += 1
        print()  # Move to the next line

def main():
    rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
    cols = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))
    print_matrix(rows, cols)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkh5an80l.py", line 22, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkh5an80l.py", line 17, in main
    rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[[1, 2], [3, 4]]'
```
