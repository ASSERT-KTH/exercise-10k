## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, the program should output an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

# Checking if the user has provided the correct number of command line arguments
if len(sys.argv) != 4:
    print('Usage: python program.py <number1> <operation> <number2>')
    sys.exit(1)

# Reading the command line arguments
num1 = float(sys.argv[1])
operation = sys.argv[2]
num2 = float(sys.argv[3])

# Checking if the operation is valid
if operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:
    print("Error: Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Performing the arithmetic operation
if operation == 'addition':
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == 'subtraction':
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == 'multiplication':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == 'division':
    if num2 == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        result = num1 / num2

# Printing the result
print('Result:', result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Usage: python program.py <number1> <operation> <number2>
```
