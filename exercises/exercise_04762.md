## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a number is odd or even. If the number is divisible by 2, it's even. If it's not divisible by 2, it's odd.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_even_or_odd(num):
    """
    Checks if a number is even or odd.

    Args:
        num (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        str: "Even" if the number is even, "Odd" otherwise.
    """
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

def main():
    # Example usage:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = check_even_or_odd(num)
    print(f"The number {num} is {result}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The number 10 is Even.
