## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains only alphabetic characters, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_alphabetic(string):
    """
    This function checks if a given string contains only alphabetic characters.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string contains only alphabetic characters, False otherwise.
    """

    # We'll use the built-in isalpha() method in Python, which returns True if all characters in the string are alphabets
    # However, this method also returns False for empty strings, so we need to handle that case separately

    # First, we check if the string is empty
    if not string:
        # If the string is empty, we return False as per the problem statement
        return False

    # Now, we can use the isalpha() method to check if all characters in the string are alphabets
    # This method will return True if all characters are alphabets and there is at least one character, otherwise it will return False
    return string.isalpha()
```
