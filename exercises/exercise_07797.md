## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and prints out a story using these words.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for noun, verb, and adjective"""
    noun = input("Please enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
    adjective = input("Please enter an adjective: ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

def generate_story(noun, verb, adjective):
    """Generate a story using the user's input"""
    story = f"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a {adjective} {noun}. " \
            f"This {noun} loved to {verb} through the rolling hills and green forests. " \
            f"As it {verb}d, it felt free and {adjective}, with the wind in its hair and the sun on its face. " \
            f"The {noun} {verb}d for hours, taking in the sights and sounds of the beautiful landscape."
    return story

def main():
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    story = generate_story(noun, verb, adjective)
    print("Here is your story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a noun: Please enter a verb: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpvy39yrp2.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpvy39yrp2.py", line 17, in main
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpvy39yrp2.py", line 4, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
