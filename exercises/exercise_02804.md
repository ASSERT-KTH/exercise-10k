from datetime import datetime

def main():
    # Print the current time
    print("Current time: ", datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S"))

    # Delay for 5 seconds
    time.sleep(5)

    # Print the time again
    print("Time after delay: ", datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
