## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the input list.
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the variance of the numbers
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the standard deviation
    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)

    return std_dev

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
    print(f"The standard deviation of {numbers} is {std_dev:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The standard deviation of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 1.41
```
