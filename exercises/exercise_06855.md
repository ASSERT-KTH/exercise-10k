## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements, and then prints the last three elements of the reversed list. If the list has less than three elements, print all the elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Given information
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Reversing the list
my_list = my_list[::-1]

# Printing the last three elements
if len(my_list) > 2:
    print(my_list[-3:])
else:
    print(my_list)
```

## Generated Output
```
[3, 2, 1]
```
