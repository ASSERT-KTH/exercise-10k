## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):
    # Addition
    sum = num1 + num2
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {sum}")

    # Subtraction
    diff = num1 - num2
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {diff}")

    # Multiplication
    product = num1 * num2
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {product}")

    # Division
    if num2 != 0:
        quotient = num1 / num2
        print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {quotient}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 10 + 2 = 12
Subtraction: 10 - 2 = 8
Multiplication: 10 * 2 = 20
Division: 10 / 2 = 5.0
```
