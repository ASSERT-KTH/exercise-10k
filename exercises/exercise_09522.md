## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message with the name. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message stating whether the user is an adult or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: Your Name
# Date: Today's Date
# Description: A simple program that greets a user by name and determines their age group.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 18:
    print(f"Hello, {name}. You are still young.")
else:
    print(f"Hello, {name}. You are an adult.")

# Note: This code uses f-strings, which are available in Python 3.6 and later versions.
# If you're using an earlier version, you can use the str.format() method instead.
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Hello, John. You are an adult.
```
