## Exercise
Create a program that takes in the transaction type and amount, then prints out the transaction report. If the transaction type is 'deposit', print 'Deposited $X', otherwise print 'Withdrawn $X'

## Reference Solution
```python
def transaction_report(transaction_type, amount):
    """
    Prints out the transaction report based on the transaction type and amount.

    Args:
        transaction_type (str): The type of transaction ('deposit' or 'withdrawal').
        amount (float): The amount of the transaction.
    """
    if transaction_type.lower() == 'deposit':
        print(f'Deposited ${amount:.2f}')
    elif transaction_type.lower() == 'withdrawal':
        print(f'Withdrawn ${amount:.2f}')
    else:
        print('Invalid transaction type. Please enter "deposit" or "withdrawal".')

def main():
    transaction_type = input('Enter the transaction type (deposit/withdrawal): ')
    amount = float(input('Enter the transaction amount: $'))
    transaction_report(transaction_type, amount)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the transaction type (deposit/withdrawal): Enter the transaction amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
