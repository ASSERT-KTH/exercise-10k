## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function that applies each function in the list to its input.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose_functions(functions):
    """
    This function takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function 
    that applies each function in the list to its input.

    Args:
        functions (list): A list of functions.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that applies each function in the list to its input.
    """

    # We define a new function inside our compose_functions function. This new function 
    # will be returned by compose_functions and will apply each function in the list 
    # to its input.
    def composed_function(input_value):
        
        # We initialize the output of our composed function with the input value.
        output = input_value
        
        # We iterate over each function in the list of functions.
        for func in functions:
            
            # For each function, we apply it to the current output and update the output.
            output = func(output)
        
        # After applying all functions, we return the final output.
        return output
    
    # We return the composed function.
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

functions = [double, add_one, square]
composed = compose_functions(functions)
print(composed(5))  # Output: 121
```

## Generated Output
```
121
```
