## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i ** 2
    return sum

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = sum_of_squares(n)
print("The sum of squares from 1 to", n, "is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of squares from 1 to 5 is: 55
```
