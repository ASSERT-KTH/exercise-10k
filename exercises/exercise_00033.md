## Exercise
Create a function that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.

    Args:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6
    print(gcd(54, 24))  # Output: 6
```

## Generated Output
```
