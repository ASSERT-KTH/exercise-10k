## Exercise
Write a function that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of another function

## Reference Solution
```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.

    Args:
        func: The function to be measured.

    Returns:
        A wrapper function that measures the execution time of the input function.
    """
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        execution_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage:
@timer_decorator
def example_function():
    """
    An example function that simulates some work.
    """
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work

# Test the example function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_function()
```

## Generated Output
```
Function example_function executed in 1.0010 seconds.
```
