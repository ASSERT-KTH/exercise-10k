## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string input from the user, reverses the string, and checks if the reversed string is the same as the original string. If they are the same, the program should print 'The string is a palindrome' and the reversed string. If they are not the same, the program should print 'The string is not a palindrome' and the reversed string.

## Reference Solution
```python
a = input("Enter a string: ")
b = a[::-1]
if a == b:
    print("The string is a palindrome")
    print(b)
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome")
    print(b)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: The string is a palindrome
madam
```
