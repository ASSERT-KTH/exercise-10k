## Exercise
Reduce a dictionary to a single value by applying a function to all its values

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def reduce_dict(dictionary, func):
    """
    Reduces a dictionary to a single value by applying a function to all its values.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to reduce.
        func (function): The function to apply to the dictionary values.

    Returns:
        The reduced value.
    """
    return reduce(func, dictionary.values())

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Reduce the dictionary to a single value by summing all its values
sum_value = reduce_dict(my_dict, lambda x, y: x + y)
print("Sum of dictionary values:", sum_value)

# Reduce the dictionary to a single value by multiplying all its values
product_value = reduce_dict(my_dict, lambda x, y: x * y)
print("Product of dictionary values:", product_value)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of dictionary values: 6
Product of dictionary values: 6
```
