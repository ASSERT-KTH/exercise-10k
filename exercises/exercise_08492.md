## Exercise
Create a program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations based on user input. The program should first ask the user to choose an operation and then input two numbers. It should then perform the chosen operation on the two numbers and display the result. Handle potential errors such as division by zero and invalid operation choices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add(num1, num2):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return num1 + num2

def subtract(num1, num2):
    """Returns the difference of two numbers."""
    return num1 - num2

def multiply(num1, num2):
    """Returns the product of two numbers."""
    return num1 * num2

def divide(num1, num2):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers."""
    if num2 == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return num1 / num2

def main():
    print("Choose an operation:")
    print("1. Addition")
    print("2. Subtraction")
    print("3. Multiplication")
    print("4. Division")

    while True:
        try:
            choice = int(input("Enter the number of your chosen operation: "))
            if choice not in range(1, 5):
                print("Invalid operation choice. Please choose a number between 1 and 4.")
                continue
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    while True:
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    while True:
        try:
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    operations = {
        1: add,
        2: subtract,
        3: multiply,
        4: divide
    }

    try:
        result = operations[choice](num1, num2)
        print(f"The result of the operation is: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Choose an operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
Enter the number of your chosen operation: Invalid input. Please enter a number.
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    choice = int(input("Enter the number of your chosen operation: "))
