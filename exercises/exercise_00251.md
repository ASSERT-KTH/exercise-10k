## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def concat(a, b):
    result = []
    while len(a) > 0:
        result += [a[0]]
        a = a[1:]
    while len(b) > 0:
        result += [b[0]]
        b = b[1:]
    return result

# Test the function
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
print(concat(a, b))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
