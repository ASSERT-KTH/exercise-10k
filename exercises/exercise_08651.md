## Exercise
Create a function that finds the difference of two given lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def list_difference(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two lists.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list.
        list2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements that are in list1 but not in list2,
               and the second list contains elements that are in list2 but not in list1.
    """
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)

    # Calculate the difference between the two sets
    diff1 = list(set1 - set2)
    diff2 = list(set2 - set1)

    return diff1, diff2

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

    diff1, diff2 = list_difference(list1, list2)
    print("Elements in list1 but not in list2:", diff1)
    print("Elements in list2 but not in list1:", diff2)
```
