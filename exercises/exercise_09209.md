## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input, checks if the age is within the valid range (18-120), and then prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is invalid, print an error message and ask for input again.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string NAME;
    int age;

    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> NAME;

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    if (age < 18 || age > 120) {
        cout << "Invalid age. Please enter an age between 18 and 120." << endl;
        cout << "Enter your age again: ";
        cin >> age;
    }

    cout << "Hello, " << NAME << "!" << endl;
    cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
