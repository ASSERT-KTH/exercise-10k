## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether they are eligible to vote or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Modules
import os

# User Input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Printing Messages
print("Welcome " + name)
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

# Voting Eligibility
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Commented Out Code
# os.system("clear")
# os.system("cls")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Welcome John
You are 25 years old.
You are eligible to vote.
```
