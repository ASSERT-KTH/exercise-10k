## Exercise
Write a program that responds to basic user inputs. Print a greeting message when the user types 'hello', print a farewell message when the user types 'bye', and print 'I didn't understand that' for any other input.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    while True:
        user_input = input("Please enter a message: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "hello":
            print("Hello! It's nice to meet you.")
        elif user_input.lower() == "bye":
            print("Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.")
            break
        else:
            print("I didn't understand that.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a message: Hello! It's nice to meet you.
Please enter a message: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpvs_hejhu.py", line 13, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpvs_hejhu.py", line 3, in main
    user_input = input("Please enter a message: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
