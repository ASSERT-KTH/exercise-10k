## Exercise
Write a function to find the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_last_occurrence(main_string, sub_string):
    """
    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.

    Args:
        main_string (str): The main string to search in.
        sub_string (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the last occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    """

    # First, we check if the substring is empty. If it is, we return 0 because an empty string is considered to be a substring of every string.
    if not sub_string:
        return 0

    # Then, we use the rfind method of the string class in Python, which returns the highest index of the substring if it is found.
    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
    last_occurrence_index = main_string.rfind(sub_string)

    # Finally, we return the index of the last occurrence of the substring.
    return last_occurrence_index

# Example usage:
main_str = "Hello world, world is beautiful"
sub_str = "world"
print(find_last_occurrence(main_str, sub_str))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
