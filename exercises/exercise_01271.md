## Exercise
Write a program to merge two or more arrays into a single array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_arrays(*arrays):
    """
    Merge two or more arrays into a single array.
    
    Args:
        *arrays: Variable number of arrays to be merged.
    
    Returns:
        A single array containing all elements from the input arrays.
    """
    return [item for array in arrays for item in array]

# Example usage:
array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]
array3 = [7, 8, 9]

merged_array = merge_arrays(array1, array2, array3)
print("Merged Array:", merged_array)
```

```python
import itertools

def merge_arrays(*arrays):
    return list(itertools.chain(*arrays))
```

## Generated Output
```
Merged Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
