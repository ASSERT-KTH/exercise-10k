## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of natural numbers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.
    """
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Square the current number and add it to the sum
        sum_squares += i ** 2
    return sum_squares


def main():
    # Example usage:
    n = 5
    result = sum_of_squares(n)
    print(f"The sum of the squares of the first {n} natural numbers is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the squares of the first 5 natural numbers is: 55
```
