## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their average

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the average of two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the two numbers.
    """
    return (num1 + num2) / 2

def main():
    # Get user input
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the average
    average = calculate_average(num1, num2)
    print(f"The average of {num1} and {num2} is: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp1rlg735d.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp1rlg735d.py", line 16, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 10'
