## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a person's name and age, then prints out a greeting message. If the person is older than 18, the message should include 'Happy Birthday!' otherwise it should include 'You are still young!'

## Reference Solution
```python
def greet_person(name, age):
    """
    Prints out a greeting message based on the person's age.

    Args:
        name (str): The person's name.
        age (int): The person's age.
    """
    if age > 18:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! Happy Birthday!")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are still young!")

def main():
    # Get user input
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    # Call the greet_person function
    greet_person(name, age)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age:
