## Exercise
Develop a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice and determine the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "User"
    return "Computer"

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")

    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == "Tie":
        print(f"It's a tie! Both chose {user_choice}.")
    else:
        print(f"The {winner} wins!")

def main():
    play_again = "y"
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Computer chose: scissors
The User wins!

Do you want to play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbuhcxsei.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpbuhcxsei.py", line 37, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
