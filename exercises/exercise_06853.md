## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to determine the grade
def determine_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

# Define the main function
def main():
    score = 88  # Test score
    grade = determine_grade(score)
    print(f"The grade is {grade}")

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The grade is B
```
