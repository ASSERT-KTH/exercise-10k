## Exercise
Create a program that takes the hour of the day as input and prints out a greeting based on the following conditions: morning (6-11), afternoon (12-16), evening (17-20), night (21-5).

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_greeting(hour):
    """
    Prints a greeting based on the hour of the day.

    Args:
    hour (int): The hour of the day (0-23)
    """
    if 6 <= hour <= 11:
        print("Good morning!")
    elif 12 <= hour <= 16:
        print("Good afternoon!")
    elif 17 <= hour <= 20:
        print("Good evening!")
    else:
        print("Good night!")

def main():
    # Get the hour from the user
    while True:
        try:
            hour = int(input("Enter the hour of the day (0-23): "))
            if 0 <= hour <= 23:
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid hour. Please enter a number between 0 and 23.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Print the greeting
    print_greeting(hour)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Enter the hour of the day (0-23): Good afternoon!
