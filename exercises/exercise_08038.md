## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to respond to basic user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user's name and age"""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
    return name, age

def respond_to_input(name, age):
    """Respond to user input based on age"""
    if age < 18:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are still young and have your whole life ahead of you.")
    elif age < 65:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are in the prime of your life. Enjoy every moment!")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You have gained a lot of experience and wisdom. Keep shining!")

def main():
    name, age = get_user_input()
    respond_to_input(name, age)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpih81fxro.py", line 21, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpih81fxro.py", line 17, in main
    name, age = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpih81fxro.py", line 4, in get_user_input
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
