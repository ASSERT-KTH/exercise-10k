## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to find the maximum number correctly even if it appears multiple times in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_number(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_num:
            max_num = number
    return max_num

def main():
    print(max_number([10, 5, 8, 22, 6, 12, 15]))
    print(max_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    print(max_number([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]))
    print(max_number([10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
