## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a coin flip and uses if/else statements to determine the outcome (heads or tails).

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    """
    Simulates a coin flip and returns the outcome.
    """
    # Generate a random number (0 or 1)
    flip = random.randint(0, 1)

    # Determine the outcome using if/else statements
    if flip == 0:
        return "Heads"
    else:
        return "Tails"

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Coin Flip Simulator!")
    play_again = "y"

    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        outcome = coin_flip()
        print(f"The coin landed on: {outcome}")
        play_again = input("Would you like to flip again? (y/n): ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Coin Flip Simulator!
The coin landed on: Heads
Would you like to flip again? (y/n):
```
