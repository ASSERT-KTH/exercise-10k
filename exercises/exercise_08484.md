## Exercise
Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two input numbers. The program should take two numbers as input and print the results of all four arithmetic operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def arithmatic_operations(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient
    sum = num1 + num2
    diff = num1 - num2
    product = num1 * num2
    quotient = num1 / num2
    
    # Print the results
    print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum)
    print("The difference of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", diff)
    print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", product)
    print("The quotient of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", quotient)

# Define another function to perform arithmetic operations
def arithmatic_operations2(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient
    sum = num1 + num2
    diff = num1 - num2
    product = num1 * num2
    quotient = num1 / num2
    
    # Print the results
    print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum)
    print("The difference of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", diff)
    print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", product)
    print("The quotient of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", quotient)

# Main part of the program
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

arithmatic_operations(num1, num2)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpgv6d7koe.py", line 30, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5 3'
```
