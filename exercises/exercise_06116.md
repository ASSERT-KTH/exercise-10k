## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the list and the values are lists of indices at which each integer appears in the original list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def list_to_dict(lst):
    dict_indices = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if num not in dict_indices:
            dict_indices[num] = [i]
        else:
            dict_indices[num].append(i)
    return dict_indices

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
print(list_to_dict(lst))
```

## Generated Output
```
{1: [0, 4, 7], 2: [1, 3, 6], 3: [2, 8], 4: [5, 9], 5: [10]}
```
