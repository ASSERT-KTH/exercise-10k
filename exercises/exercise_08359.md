## Exercise
Write a function that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps. The function should take two parameters: the array to be rotated and the number of steps to rotate. The function should return the rotated array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(array, steps):
    """
    Rotate the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps.

    Parameters:
    array (list): The array to be rotated.
    steps (int): The number of steps to rotate.

    Returns:
    list: The rotated array.
    """

    # Check if the array is empty, in which case we return the original array
    if not array:
        return array

    # Calculate the effective number of steps, in case the number of steps is greater than the length of the array
    # This is done by finding the remainder of the division of the number of steps by the length of the array
    effective_steps = steps % len(array)
    
    # If the effective number of steps is 0, return the original array
    if effective_steps == 0:
        return array
    
    # Split the array into two parts: the part that will be moved to the beginning and the part that will stay at the end
    # The part that will be moved to the beginning starts from the end of the array and has a length of 'effective_steps'
    part_to_move = array[-effective_steps:]
    
    # The part that will stay at the end starts from the beginning of the array and has a length of 'len(array) - effective_steps'
    part_to_stay = array[:-effective_steps]
    
    # Combine the two parts in reverse order to get the rotated array
    rotated_array = part_to_move + part_to_stay
    
    # Return the rotated array
    return rotated_array
```
