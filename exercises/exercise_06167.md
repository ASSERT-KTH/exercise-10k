## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns the value associated with a given key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    This function retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key: The key to search for.

    Returns:
        The value associated with the key if found, otherwise None.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input is not a dictionary")

    # Then, we try to get the value associated with the given key
    # We use the get method of the dictionary, which returns None by default if the key is not found
    # This way, we avoid a KeyError that would be raised if we used dictionary[key]
    value = dictionary.get(key)

    # Finally, we return the value
    return value

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(get_dict_value(my_dict, "name"))  # Outputs: John
print(get_dict_value(my_dict, "city"))  # Outputs: None
```

## Generated Output
```
John
None
```
