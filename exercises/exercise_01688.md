## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    """
    Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    while True:

        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()

        # Validate user choice
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        # Get computer choice
        choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        # Print choices
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")

        # Determine winner

        # Play again?
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        while play_again not in ["yes", "no"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid choice. Please enter yes or no: ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_rock_paper_scissors()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors

Rock smashes scissors! You win!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/tmp/tmp76sn_pjz.py", line 46, in play_rock_paper_scissors
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
