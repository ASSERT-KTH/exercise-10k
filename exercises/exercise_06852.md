## Exercise
Create a function called 'calculate_factorial' that takes a single integer 'n' as input and returns the factorial of that number. The function should handle cases where 'n' is less than 0, and raise a ValueError with a suitable error message. For 'n' greater than or equal to 0, the function should return the factorial of 'n'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    This function calculates the factorial of a given integer 'n'.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of 'n' if 'n' is greater than or equal to 0.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If 'n' is less than 0.
    """

    # First, we check if the input number 'n' is less than 0
    if n < 0:
        # If 'n' is less than 0, we raise a ValueError with a suitable error message
        raise ValueError("Input number 'n' cannot be less than 0.")
    
    # If 'n' is 0 or 1, we return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # We initialize a variable 'result' to 1, which will store the factorial of 'n'
    result = 1
    
    # We use a for loop to iterate from 2 to 'n' (inclusive) and calculate the factorial
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # In each iteration, we multiply 'result' by the current number 'i'
        result *= i
    
    # Finally, we return the calculated factorial
    return result
```
