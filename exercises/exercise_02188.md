## Exercise
Create a function to count the frequency of each character in a given string. The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_char_frequency(input_string):
    """
    This function counts the frequency of each character in a given string.
    
    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string for which the character frequencies are to be calculated.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the character frequencies
    char_frequency = {}

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        
        # Check if the character is already in the dictionary
        if char in char_frequency:
            
            # If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1
            char_frequency[char] += 1
        
        else:
            
            # If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a frequency of 1
            char_frequency[char] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the character frequencies
    return char_frequency

# Example usage:
print(count_char_frequency("Hello, World!"))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'H': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ',': 1, ' ': 1, 'W': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1, '!': 1}
```
