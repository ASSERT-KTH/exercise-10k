## Reference Solution
```python
def read_and_write_characters():
    """
    Reads and writes individual characters from standard input to standard output.
    """
    while True:
        char = input("Enter a character (or 'q' to quit): ")
        
        # Check if user wants to quit
        if char.lower() == 'q':
            break
        
        # Write the character to standard output
        print(f"You entered: {char}")

def main():
    read_and_write_characters()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
