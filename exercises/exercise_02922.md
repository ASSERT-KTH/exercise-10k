## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number and uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_user_guess():
    """Get the user's guess and validate the input."""
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
            return guess
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def main():
    """Generate a random number and repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly."""
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    while True:
        # Get the user's guess
        guess = get_user_guess()
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the guess is correct
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Guess the number: Too high!
Guess the number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    guess = get_user_guess()
  File "/tmp/tmpyfwclhmk.py", line 7, in get_user_guess
    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
