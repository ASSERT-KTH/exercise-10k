## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out whether they are eligible to vote or not. The voting age is 18. If the user is 18 or older, print 'You are eligible to vote.' Otherwise, print 'You are not eligible to vote.'

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility():
    """
    Asks the user for their age and prints whether they are eligible to vote.
    """
    # Get the user's age
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Check if the user is eligible to vote
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_voting_eligibility()
```
