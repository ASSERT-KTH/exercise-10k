## Exercise
Develop a program to check the strength of a given password based on its length and characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def check_password_strength(password):
    """
    Checks the strength of a given password.

    Args:
    password (str): The password to check.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the password strength and suggestions for improvement.
    """

    # Initialize the password strength score
    score = 0

    # Initialize the suggestions list
    suggestions = []

    # Check the password length
    if len(password) < 8:
        suggestions.append("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")
    else:
        score += 1

    # Check for uppercase letters
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        suggestions.append("Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.")
    else:
        score += 1

    # Check for lowercase letters
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        suggestions.append("Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.")
    else:
        score += 1

    # Check for digits
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        suggestions.append("Password should contain at least one digit.")
    else:
        score += 1

    # Check for special characters
    if not re.search("[^A-Za-z0-9]", password):
        suggestions.append("Password should contain at least one special character.")
    else:
        score += 1

    # Determine the password strength based on the score
    if score == 5:
        strength = "Strong"
    elif score >= 3:
        strength = "Medium"
    else:
        strength = "Weak"

    return {
        "strength": strength,
        "score": score,
        "suggestions": suggestions
    }

def main():
    # Get the password from the user
    password = input("Enter a password: ")

    # Check the password strength
    result = check_password_strength(password)

    # Print the password strength and suggestions
    print(f"Password strength: {result['strength']}")
    print(f"Score: {result['score']}/5")
    if result['suggestions']:
        print("Suggestions for improvement:")
        for suggestion in result['suggestions']:
            print(f"* {suggestion}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password strength: Strong
Score: 5/5
```
