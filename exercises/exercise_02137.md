## Exercise
Create a function that takes a 2D array as input and returns a new 2D array containing the same elements, but with the rows and columns transposed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose_2d_array(input_array):
    """
    This function takes a 2D array as input and returns a new 2D array containing the same elements, 
    but with the rows and columns transposed.

    Args:
        input_array (list): A 2D list of elements.

    Returns:
        list: A new 2D list with the rows and columns of the input array transposed.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(input_array, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")

    # Then, we check if all elements in the input list are also lists. If not, we raise a ValueError.
    if not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_array):
        raise ValueError("All elements in the input list must be lists.")

    # We use the built-in zip function in Python, which makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
    # The * operator is used to unpack the input_array into separate arguments for the zip function.
    # This will give us an iterator of tuples where the first tuple contains the first element from each of the argument sequences or iterables,
    # the second tuple contains the second element from each, and so on.
    transposed_array = zip(*input_array)

    # We convert each tuple in the transposed_array into a list and return the result.
    # We use a list comprehension to create a new list with the converted tuples.
    # The list function is used to convert each tuple into a list.
    return [list(row) for row in transposed_array]
```
