## Exercise
Write a program that finds the minimum number in a list of numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_minimum(numbers):
    """
    Find the minimum number in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number in the list.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")

    min_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num < min_num:
            min_num = num

    return min_num


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]
    print("List of numbers:", numbers)
    print("Minimum number:", find_minimum(numbers))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
List of numbers: [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]
Minimum number: 7
```
