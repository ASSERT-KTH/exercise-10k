## Exercise
Create a program that repeats back to the user what they have typed, after they press enter.

## Reference Solution
```python
def echo_program():
    """
    Repeats back to the user what they have typed, after they press enter.
    """
    while True:
        user_input = input("Type something (or 'quit' to exit): ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        print("You typed: ", user_input)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    echo_program()
```

## Generated Output
```
Type something (or 'quit' to exit): You typed:  Hello
Type something (or 'quit' to exit): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmph5mh6zj8.py", line 13, in <module>
    echo_program()
  File "/tmp/tmph5mh6zj8.py", line 6, in echo_program
    user_input = input("Type something (or 'quit' to exit): ")
