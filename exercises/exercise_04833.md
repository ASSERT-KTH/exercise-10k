## Exercise
Write a program to declare and use a complex variable to store a complex number value.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Complex Number Program

# Declare a complex variable
complex_num = complex(3, 2)

# Print the complex number
print("Complex Number: ", complex_num)

# Access real and imaginary parts
real_part = complex_num.real
imaginary_part = complex_num.imag

# Print the real and imaginary parts
print("Real Part: ", real_part)
print("Imaginary Part: ", imaginary_part)

# Perform operations with complex numbers
num1 = complex(1, 2)
num2 = complex(2, 3)

# Addition
addition = num1 + num2
print("Addition: ", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = num1 - num2
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)

# Multiplication
multiplication = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)

# Division
division = num1 / num2
print("Division: ", division)
```

## Generated Output
```
Complex Number:  (3+2j)
Real Part:  3.0
Imaginary Part:  2.0
Addition:  (3+5j)
Subtraction:  (-1-1j)
Multiplication:  (-4+7j)
Division:  (0.6153846153846154+0.07692307692307691j)
