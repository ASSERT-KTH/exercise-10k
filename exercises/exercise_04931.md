## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the time given the hours, minutes, and seconds. The program should use the formula total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds to calculate the total seconds.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    """
    Calculate the total seconds given the hours, minutes, and seconds.

    Args:
        hours (int): The hours.
        minutes (int): The minutes.
        seconds (int): The seconds.

    Returns:
        int: The total seconds.
    """
    total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds
    return total_seconds

def main():
    # Get the hours, minutes, and seconds from the user
    hours = int(input("Enter the hours: "))
    minutes = int(input("Enter the minutes: "))
    seconds = int(input("Enter the seconds: "))

    # Calculate the total seconds
    total_seconds = calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)

    # Print the total seconds
    print(f"{hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, and {seconds} seconds is equal to {total_seconds} seconds.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the hours: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpakepc6gj.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpakepc6gj.py", line 18, in main
    hours = int(input("Enter the hours: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 30 15'
```
