## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers and a target value as input, and returns the index of the target value if it exists in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

def search(nums, target):
    try:
        index = nums.index(target)
        return index
    except ValueError:
        return -1

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = search(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

## Generated Output
```
2
```
