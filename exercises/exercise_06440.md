## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the number of permutations of a given set of objects. Use a for loop to iterate over the objects and calculate the number of permutations.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_permutations(n):
    permutations = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        permutations *= i
    return permutations

n = int(input("Enter the number of objects: "))
result = calculate_permutations(n)
print("Number of permutations:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of objects: Number of permutations: 6
```
