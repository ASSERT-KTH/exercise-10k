## Reference Solution
```python
def get_valid_age():
    """
    Asks the user for their age and validates that it is a positive integer.
    
    Returns:
        int: The user's age.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if age > 0:
                return age
            else:
                print("Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def main():
    age = get_valid_age()
    print(f"Your age is: {age}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
