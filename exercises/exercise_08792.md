## Exercise
Write a program that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    This function calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input radius is a non-negative number.
    # This is because the radius of a circle cannot be negative.
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("The radius of a circle cannot be negative.")

    # Now, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is pi * r^2.
    # We will use the math library in Python to get the value of pi.
    # We will then square the radius and multiply it by pi to get the area.
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

    # Finally, we will return the calculated area.
    return area

# Example usage:
radius = 5
print(calculate_circle_area(radius))
```
