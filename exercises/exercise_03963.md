## Exercise
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. The program should take an integer n as input and output the Fibonacci sequence as a list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(fibonacci(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
