## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the discount amount based on the total cost and discount percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(total_cost, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discount amount based on the total cost and discount percentage.

    Args:
        total_cost (float): The total cost of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The discount amount.
    """
    discount_amount = (total_cost / 100) * discount_percentage
    return discount_amount

def main():
    # Get the total cost and discount percentage from the user
    total_cost = float(input("Enter the total cost: $"))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage (%): "))

    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_cost, discount_percentage)

    # Calculate the final cost after discount
    final_cost = total_cost - discount_amount

    # Print the results
    print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%")
    print(f"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Final Cost: ${final_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total cost: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpk2qxmjsf.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpk2qxmjsf.py", line 17, in main
    total_cost = float(input("Enter the total cost: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Total cost 100, Discount percentage 10%'
