## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_char_frequency(input_string):
    """
    This function calculates the frequency of each character in a given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string for which character frequency needs to be calculated.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.
    """
    char_frequency = {}
    for char in input_string:
        if char in char_frequency:
            char_frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            char_frequency[char] = 1
    return char_frequency


def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    char_frequency = calculate_char_frequency(input_string)
    print("Character Frequency:")
    for char, frequency in char_frequency.items():
        print(f"{char}: {frequency}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Character Frequency:
H: 1
e: 1
l: 3
o: 2
 : 1
W: 1
r: 1
d: 1
```
