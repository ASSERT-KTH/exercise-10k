## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the even numbers using the filter function

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a list of even numbers from the input list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of even integers.
    """
    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
