## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers and print each number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each number
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

```python
// Define the array of numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each number
for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
}
```

## Generated Output
```
