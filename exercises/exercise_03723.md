## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name, age, and city as input and prints out a formatted string with this information.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Get user's name, age, and city as input."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    city = input("Please enter your city: ")
    return name, age, city

def print_user_info(name, age, city):
    """Print out a formatted string with user's information."""
    print(f"Your name is {name}, you are {age} years old, and you live in {city}.")

def main():
    """Main function."""
    name, age, city = get_user_info()
    print_user_info(name, age, city)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
