## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculates the grade based on the given score.

    Args:
        score (int): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"


def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = int(input("Enter the student's score: "))
            if score < 0 or score > 100:
                print("Score should be between 0 and 100.")
                continue
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
