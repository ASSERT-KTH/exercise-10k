## Exercise
Write a program that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is a power of two, and false otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number is a power of two.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is a power of two, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 32]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"{num} is a power of two: {is_power_of_two(num)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
1 is a power of two: True
2 is a power of two: True
3 is a power of two: False
4 is a power of two: True
5 is a power of two: False
8 is a power of two: True
16 is a power of two: True
32 is a power of two: True
```
