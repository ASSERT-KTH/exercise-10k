## Exercise
Write a program that evaluates a given condition and returns a corresponding message. The program should ask for the user's age and then check if they are eligible to vote (age >= 18). If eligible, it should print 'You are eligible to vote.' Otherwise, it should print 'You are not eligible to vote.'

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Modules
import sys

# Defining the Function
def main():
    # Getting User Input
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    age = int(age)

    # Checking Eligibility
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Running the Program
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your age: You are eligible to vote.
```
