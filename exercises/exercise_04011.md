## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 checkerboard pattern of asterisks (*) and dots (.).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Create a 5x5 grid filled with asterisks (*)
grid = [['*' for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]

# Replace alternate squares with dots (.)
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if (i + j) % 2 == 1:
            grid[i][j] = '.'

# Print the checkerboard pattern
for row in grid:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

## Generated Output
```
* . * . *
