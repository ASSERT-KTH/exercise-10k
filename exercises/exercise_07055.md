## Exercise
Write a program that takes an email address as input and prints out whether it is valid or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    # Regular expression pattern to match most common email address formats
    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"
    
    # Check if the email matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    email = input("Enter an email address: ")
    
    # Check if the email is valid
    if validate_email(email):
        print(f"{email} is a valid email address.")
    else:
        print(f"{email} is not a valid email address.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
