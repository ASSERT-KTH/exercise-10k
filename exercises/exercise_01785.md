## Exercise
Create a function to delete a given key from a dictionary, handling the case where the key does not exist.

## Reference Solution
```python
def delete_key(dictionary, key):
    """
    Deletes a given key from a dictionary. If the key does not exist, 
    the dictionary remains unchanged.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to delete the key from.
        key (any): The key to be deleted.

    Returns:
        dict: The updated dictionary after deletion.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    if key in dictionary:
        # If the key exists, we use the del statement to remove it from the dictionary
        del dictionary[key]
    
    # Regardless of whether the key existed or not, we return the dictionary
    # This could be the original dictionary if the key didn't exist, or the updated dictionary if it did
    return dictionary

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(delete_key(my_dict, 'b'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}
print(delete_key(my_dict, 'd'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'c': 3}
{'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```
