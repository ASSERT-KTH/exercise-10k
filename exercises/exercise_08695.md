## Exercise
Create a simple Mad Libs game that asks the user for different types of words and then prints out a funny story with the words inserted.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input for a specific type of word
def get_word(prompt):
    """Get a word from the user."""
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:  # Check if the input is not empty
            return word
        print("Please enter a word.")

# Define a function to play the Mad Libs game
def play_mad_libs():
    """Play the Mad Libs game."""
    print("Welcome to Mad Libs! Please provide the following words:")

    # Get user input for different types of words
    noun = get_word("Enter a noun: ")
    adjective = get_word("Enter an adjective: ")
    verb = get_word("Enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): ")
    adverb = get_word("Enter an adverb (e.g., quickly, loudly, wisely): ")
    place = get_word("Enter a place: ")
    type_of_food = get_word("Enter a type of food: ")

    # Define a list of funny stories
    stories = [
        f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. Suddenly, it started to {verb} {adverb} towards the {place}. When it arrived, it found a delicious {type_of_food} waiting for it.",
        f"In a faraway land, there was a magical {noun} that could {verb} {adverb}. The {noun} lived in a beautiful {place} surrounded by {type_of_food}. One day, a {adjective} knight came to visit the {noun} and they became fast friends.",

    ]

    # Randomly select a story and print it
    story = random.choice(stories)
    print("\nHere's your funny story:")
    print(story)

# Play the Mad Libs game
play_mad_libs()
```
