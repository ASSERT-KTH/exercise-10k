## Exercise
Create a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should be a square of asterisks with the size specified by the user. Use loops to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_square(size):
    """
    Prints a square pattern of asterisks with the specified size.

    Args:
        size (int): The size of the square.
    """
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            print("*", end=" ")
        print()

def main():
    # Get the size of the square from the user
    size = int(input("Enter the size of the square: "))

    # Print the square pattern
    print_square(size)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the size of the square: * * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * *
```
