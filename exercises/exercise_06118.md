## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists of integers and a key function as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers from both lists, merged according to the key function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_list(A, B, key):
    """
    Merge two lists of integers based on a given key function.

    Args:
    A (list): First list of integers.
    B (list): Second list of integers.
    key (function): Key function to determine the order of the merged list.

    Returns:
    list: A new list containing all the integers from A and B, merged according to the key function.
    """
    return sorted(A + B, key=key)

# Example usage:
my_key = lambda x: x % 2
A = [1, 3, 5]
B = [2, 4, 6]

print(merge_list(A, B, my_key))
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
```
