## Exercise
Write a program that takes a person's age as input and prints out a message indicating whether they are an adult or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_adult(age):
    """
    Checks if a person is an adult based on their age.

    Args:
        age (int): The person's age.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the person is an adult, False otherwise.
    """
    # Assuming adult age is 18 and above
    adult_age = 18
    return age >= adult_age


def main():
    # Get the person's age from the user
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")

    # Check if the person is an adult
    if check_adult(age):
        print("You are an adult.")
    else:
        print("You are not an adult.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
