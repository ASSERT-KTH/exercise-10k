## Exercise
Write a program to divide two numbers and print the result, including the remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Divide two numbers and print the result, including the remainder.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        return

    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor

    print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dividend = 17
    divisor = 5
    divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
```

## Generated Output
```
17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2.
```
