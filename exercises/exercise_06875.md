## Exercise
Create a program that utilizes functions to perform advanced mathematical operations. The program should have separate functions for calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, the volume and surface area of a sphere, and the sum of the squares of two numbers. Each function should take the necessary parameters and return the calculated result. The main part of the program should prompt the user to choose an operation and then call the corresponding function with user-provided inputs.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Rectangle Functions
def rect_area(a, b):
    return a * b

def rect_perimeter(a, b):
    return 2 * (a + b)

# Sphere Functions
def sphere_volume(r):
    return (4/3) * 3.14159 * (r ** 3)

def sphere_surface_area(r):
    return 4 * 3.14159 * (r ** 2)

# Sum of Squares Function
def sum_squares(a, b):
    return a ** 2 + b ** 2

# Main Program
while True:
    print("Choose an operation:")
    print("1. Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle")
    print("2. Calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere")
    print("3. Calculate the sum of the squares of two numbers")
    print("4. Exit the program")
    
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        a = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
        b = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
        print(f"Area: {rect_area(a, b)}")
        print(f"Perimeter: {rect_perimeter(a, b)}")
    elif choice == "2":
        r = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
        print(f"Volume: {sphere_volume(r)}")
        print(f"Surface Area: {sphere_surface_area(r)}")
    elif choice == "3":
        a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        print(f"Sum of Squares: {sum_squares(a, b)}")
    elif choice == "4":
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

## Generated Output
