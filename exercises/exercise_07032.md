## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a dictionary of students and their respective grades, and calculates the average grade for each student. The grades should be stored in a list for each student. The program should then return a new dictionary with the average grade for each student.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(students_grades):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a dictionary.

    Args:
        students_grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their average grades.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary
    for student, grades in students_grades.items():
        # Check if the list of grades is not empty
        if len(grades) > 0:
            # Calculate the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades
            average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)
            
            # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
            average_grades[student] = average_grade
        else:
            # If the list of grades is empty, store a message indicating that there are no grades
            average_grades[student] = "No grades available"

    # Return the dictionary with the average grades for each student
    return average_grades


# Example usage:
students_grades = {
    "John": [90, 85, 95],
    "Alice": [88, 92, 89],
    "Bob": []
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(students_grades)
print(average_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90.0, 'Alice': 89.66666666666667, 'Bob': 'No grades available'}
```
