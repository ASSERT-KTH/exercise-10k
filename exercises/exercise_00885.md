## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for the temperature outside and prints out a weather forecast based on the following conditions: hot (above 80), warm (65-79), cool (50-64), cold (below 50).

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_temperature():
    """Asks the user for the temperature outside."""
    while True:
        try:
            temperature = float(input("Please enter the temperature outside: "))
            return temperature
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

def get_weather_forecast(temperature):
    """Determines the weather forecast based on the temperature."""
    if temperature > 80:
        return "Hot"
    elif 65 <= temperature <= 79:
        return "Warm"
    elif 50 <= temperature <= 64:
        return "Cool"
    else:
        return "Cold"

def main():
    temperature = get_temperature()
    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature)
    print(f"The weather forecast is: {forecast}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the temperature outside: The weather forecast is: Warm
```
