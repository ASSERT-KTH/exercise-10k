## Exercise
Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and outputs its volume.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_cube_volume(side_length):
    """
    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.

    Args:
        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the cube.
    """
    if side_length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Side length must be a positive number")

    volume = side_length ** 3
    return volume


def main():
    # Get the side length from the user
    side_length = float(input("Enter the side length of the cube: "))

    try:
        # Calculate and print the volume
        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)
        print(f"The volume of the cube is {volume:.2f} cubic units.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the side length of the cube: The volume of the cube is 125.00 cubic units.
```
