## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The program should use the formula area = length * width to calculate the area.

## Reference Solution
```python
"""
This program calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
The formula used is area = length * width.
"""

def calculate_area(length, width):
    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
    
    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.
    
    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """
    area = length * width
    return area

def main():
    # Get the length and width from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

    # Calculate the area
    area = calculate_area(length, width)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmps0727hj9.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmps0727hj9.py", line 22, in main
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 10'
