## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of these operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Description
This program performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers and prints the results.

## Requirements
The program requires two numbers as input.

## Code
```

```python
## Explanation
1. The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers using the `input` function.
2. The input values are converted to floating-point numbers using the `float` function.
3. The program then performs the arithmetic operations using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators.
4. The results of each operation are stored in separate variables (`sum`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div`).
5. Finally, the program prints the results of each operation using the `print` function.

### Note
This program does not handle the case where the second number is zero, which would result in a division-by-zero error. To handle this case, you could add a conditional statement to check if the second number is zero before performing the division operation.
