## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of lists of integers as input, and returns a new list of lists containing the same elements, but with the rows and columns transposed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose(lists):
    if not lists:  # check if the input list is empty
        return []
    return list(map(list, zip(*lists)))

# Test the function
print(transpose([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))
```

## Generated Output
```
[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```
