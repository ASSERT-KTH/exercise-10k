## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers and a target value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value if it exists in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_first_occurrence(nums, target):
    """
    Find the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the list.

    Args:
        nums (list): The list of numbers to search.
        target (int): The target value to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the target value, or -1 if not found.
    """
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5
result = find_first_occurrence(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: 4

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 10
result = find_first_occurrence(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```

## Generated Output
```
4
-1
```
