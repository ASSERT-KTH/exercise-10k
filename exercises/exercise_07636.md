## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to generate a password of a given length.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    """
    Generates a password of the given length.
    
    Args:
        length (int): The length of the password.
    
    Returns:
        str: The generated password.
    """
    # Define the characters that can be used in the password
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    
    # Initialize an empty password
    password = ""
    
    # Use a for loop to generate the password
    for _ in range(length):
        # Randomly select a character from the possible characters
        password += random.choice(characters)
    
    return password

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))
    password = generate_password(length)
    print("Generated Password : ", password)
```

## Generated Output
