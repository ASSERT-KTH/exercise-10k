## Exercise
Write a program that compares two numbers using variables and prints out the result of the comparison.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define two variables with numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

# Compare the numbers and print the result
if num1 > num2:
    print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}")
elif num1 < num2:
    print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}")
else:
    print(f"{num1} is equal to {num2}")

# You can also use comparison operators to store the result in a variable
result = num1 > num2
print(f"Is {num1} greater than {num2}? {result}")

result = num1 < num2
print(f"Is {num1} less than {num2}? {result}")

result = num1 == num2
print(f"Is {num1} equal to {num2}? {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
10 is less than 20
Is 10 greater than 20? False
Is 10 less than 20? True
Is 10 equal to 20? False
```
