## Exercise
Write a function that returns another function with access to its own scope

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(outer_var):
    """
    Returns a function with access to its own scope.

    Args:
    outer_var (str): The variable accessible from the inner function.

    Returns:
    function: The inner function with access to the outer function's scope.
    """

    def inner_function(inner_var):
        """
        The inner function with access to the outer function's scope.

        Args:
        inner_var (str): The variable passed to the inner function.

        Returns:
        str: A string combining the outer and inner variables.
        """
        return f"Outer variable: {outer_var}, Inner variable: {inner_var}"

    return inner_function


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a closure by calling the outer function
    closure = outer_function("Hello")

    # Use the closure to access the outer function's scope
    print(closure("World"))  # Output: Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World
```
