## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The function should take a number as an argument and return the factorial.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    This function calculates the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """

    # First, we check if the input number is negative. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")

    # We initialize the result variable to 1. This will be used to store the factorial.
    result = 1

    # We loop through all numbers from 2 to the input number (inclusive).
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # For each number, we multiply the result by the current number.
        result *= i

    # Finally, we return the calculated factorial.
    return result
```
