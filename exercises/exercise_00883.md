## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their score on a test (out of 100) and prints out their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_grade(score):
    """Returns the grade based on the score"""
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Ask the user for their score
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter your test score (out of 100): "))
            if score < 0 or score > 100:
                print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Get the grade and print it
    grade = get_grade(score)
    print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your test score (out of 100): Your grade is: B
```
