## Exercise
Write a program that takes the price of an item and the tax rate as input and outputs the total price.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_price(price, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the total price of an item after tax.

    Args:
        price (float): The price of the item.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.

    Returns:
        float: The total price of the item after tax.
    """
    tax_amount = price * tax_rate
    total_price = price + tax_amount
    return total_price


def main():
    # Get the price and tax rate from the user
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 8 for 8%): "))
    tax_rate /= 100  # Convert the tax rate to a decimal

    # Calculate and display the total price
    total_price = calculate_total_price(price, tax_rate)
    print(f"The total price of the item is: ${total_price:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the price of the item: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpw2oygrq_.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpw2oygrq_.py", line 19, in main
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: $"))
