## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a number, and prints out a sequence of numbers from 1 to that number

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_number_sequence():
    """
    Asks the user for a number and prints out a sequence of numbers from 1 to that number.
    """
    # Ask the user for a number
    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
            if num <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive integer.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")

    # Print the number sequence
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        print(i)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_number_sequence()
```
