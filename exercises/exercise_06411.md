## Exercise
Write a program that plays a simple game with the user. Use if/else statements to determine the outcome.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'user'
    else:
        return 'computer'

def play_game():
    """Plays a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
    
    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == 'tie':
        print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
    elif winner == 'user':
        print(f"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win!")
    else:
        print(f"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! You lose.")

def main():
    """Plays multiple games of Rock, Paper, Scissors."""
    play_again = 'yes'
    while play_again.lower() == 'yes':
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
