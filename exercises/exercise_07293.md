## Exercise
Create a function that takes the original price and the discount percentage as arguments and returns the price after the discount

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discounted_price(original_price: float, discount_percentage: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the price after a discount has been applied.

    Args:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The percentage discount to apply.

    Returns:
        float: The price after the discount has been applied.
    """
    # Check if the discount percentage is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if not 0 <= discount_percentage <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100")

    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price

    # Calculate the price after the discount
    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount

    return discounted_price

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_price = 100.0
    discount_percentage = 20.0
    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)
    print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%")
    print(f"Discounted Price: ${discounted_price:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Original Price: $100.00
Discount Percentage: 20.0%
Discounted Price: $80.00
```
