## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, both of which are integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculateEvenSum(start, end):
    evenSum = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            evenSum += i
    return evenSum

# Example usage:
print(calculateEvenSum(1, 10))  # Output: 30
```

## Generated Output
```
30
```
