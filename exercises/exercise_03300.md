## Exercise
Write a program that converts negative numbers to positive using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_to_positive(numbers):
    """
    Converts negative numbers to positive in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: The input list with all negative numbers converted to positive.
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < 0:
            numbers[i] = -numbers[i]
    return numbers

# Example usage
numbers = [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("List with negative numbers converted to positive:", convert_to_positive(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
List with negative numbers converted to positive: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
