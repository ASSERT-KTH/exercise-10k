## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and replaces all occurrences of a specified element with a new element. The program should accept four parameters: the array, the element to replace, the new element, and the maximum number of replacements allowed. If the maximum number of replacements is reached, the program should stop replacing elements even if there are more occurrences of the element to replace.

## Reference Solution
```python
def replace_elements(array, element, new_element, max_replacements):
    new_array = array[:]
    replacements = 0

    for i, val in enumerate(new_array):
        if val == element and replacements < max_replacements:
            new_array[i] = new_element
            replacements += 1

    return new_array

# Example usage:
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
element = 2
new_element = 10
max_replacements = 2

result = replace_elements(array, element, new_element, max_replacements)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 10, 3, 10, 4, 2, 5]
```
