## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 hollow square pattern of asterisks (*).

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_hollow_square(size):
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            # Print asterisk if it's on the border
            if i == 0 or i == size - 1 or j == 0 or j == size - 1:
                print("*", end=" ")
            else:
                print(" ", end=" ")
        print()

# Print a 5x5 hollow square
print_hollow_square(5)
```

## Generated Output
