## Exercise
Write a function to access a value from a dictionary by its key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def access_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    This function accesses a value from a dictionary by its key.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.
        key (any): The key of the value to be accessed.

    Returns:
        any: The value associated with the given key if it exists in the dictionary. Otherwise, it raises a KeyError.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary to avoid a KeyError
    if key in dictionary:
        
        # If the key exists, we can directly access the value using the dictionary's indexing syntax
        return dictionary[key]
    
    # If the key does not exist, we raise a KeyError with a custom message
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.")

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(access_dict_value(my_dict, "name"))  # Outputs: John
```

## Generated Output
```
John
```
