## Exercise
Write a program to check if a given number is a power of two.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given number is a power of two.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is a power of two, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Example usage:
def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"Is {num} a power of two? {is_power_of_two(num)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 1 a power of two? True
Is 2 a power of two? True
Is 4 a power of two? True
Is 8 a power of two? True
Is 16 a power of two? True
Is 20 a power of two? False
Is 32 a power of two? True
Is 64 a power of two? True
