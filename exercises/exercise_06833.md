## Exercise
Create a program that prompts the user for their name and age, then prints out a personalized greeting message including their name and age, and also tells them how old they will be in 5 years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Prompt the user for their name and age."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
    return name, age


def print_greeting(name, age):
    """Print a personalized greeting message."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.")
    print(f"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.")


def main():
    """Main function."""
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print_greeting(name, age)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
