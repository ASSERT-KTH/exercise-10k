## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to let the user play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer until they choose to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Returns the winner of the game."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return 'user'
    return 'computer'

def main():
    play_again = 'y'
    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            user_choice = input("Invalid input. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\n")
        
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'tie':
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif winner == 'user':
            print("You win!")
        else:
            print("Computer wins!")
        
        play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")
        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Play again? (y/n): ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose rock, computer chose paper.

Computer wins!
