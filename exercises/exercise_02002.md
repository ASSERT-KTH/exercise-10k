## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and returns the corresponding grade using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the input score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade.
    """

    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100."

    # Determine the grade based on the score
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"


def main():
    # Get the student's score as input
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print("The student's grade is:", grade)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
