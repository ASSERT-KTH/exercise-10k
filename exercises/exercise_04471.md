## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of numbers in a list using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of the numbers in the list.
    """
    sum_squares = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum_squares += num ** 2
    return sum_squares

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print("Sum of squares:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squares: 55
```
