## Exercise
Create a generator to produce a sequence of numbers and use it to calculate the sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sequence_generator(n):
    """
    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.
    
    Yields:
        int: The next number in the sequence.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        yield i

def calculate_sum(generator):
    """
    Calculate the sum of numbers produced by the generator.
    
    Args:
        generator: The generator object that produces the sequence of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the numbers in the sequence.
    """
    return sum(generator)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 10  # Change this to generate a different sequence
    generator = sequence_generator(n)
    total_sum = calculate_sum(generator)
    print(f"Sum of the sequence from 1 to {n}: {total_sum}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of the sequence from 1 to 10: 55
```
