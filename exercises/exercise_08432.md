## Exercise
Write a program that uses conditional statements to control the flow of a function.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        """
        Initialize a bank account with a given balance.

        Args:
            balance (float, optional): Initial balance. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposit a given amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): Amount to deposit.
        """
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraw a given amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): Amount to withdraw.
        """
        if amount > 0:
            if amount <= self.balance:
                self.balance -= amount

            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Print the current account balance.
        """
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000 balance

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
