## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers
questions = {
    "What is the capital of France?": {
        "A": "Paris",
        "B": "London",
        "C": "Berlin",
        "D": "Rome",
        "answer": "A"
    },
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": {
        "A": "Earth",
        "B": "Saturn",
        "C": "Jupiter",
        "D": "Uranus",
        "answer": "C"
    },
    "What is the chemical symbol for gold?": {
        "A": "Ag",
        "B": "Au",
        "C": "Hg",
        "D": "Pb",
        "answer": "B"
    }
}

def quiz():
    # Initialize score
    score = 0

    # Iterate over each question
    for question, options in questions.items():
        print(question)
        for option, value in options.items():
            if option != "answer":
                print(f"{option}: {value}")

        # Ask the user for their answer
        user_answer = input("Choose your answer (A, B, C, D): ").upper()

        # Check if the user's answer is correct
        if user_answer == options["answer"]:
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, the correct answer is {options['answer']}: {options[options['answer']]}\n")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"Quiz finished! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    quiz()
```

```python
questions["What is the smallest country in the world?"] = {
    "A": "Vatican City",
    "B": "Monaco",
    "C": "Nauru",
    "D": "Tuvalu",
    "answer": "A"
}
```
