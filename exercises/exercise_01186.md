## Reference Solution
```python
from datetime import datetime

def print_greeting():
    # Get the current time
    now = datetime.now()
    
    # Get the hour from the current time
    hour = now.hour
    
    # Determine the greeting based on the hour
    if 0 <= hour < 12:
        greeting = "Good morning!"
    elif 12 <= hour < 17:
        greeting = "Good afternoon!"
    else:
        greeting = "Good evening!"
    
    # Print the greeting
    print(greeting)

# Call the function
print_greeting()
```
