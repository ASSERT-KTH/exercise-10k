    subject2_score = float(input("Enter score in Subject 2: "))
    subject3_score = float(input("Enter score in Subject 3: "))

    # Calculate the average grade
    average_grade = (subject1_score + subject2_score + subject3_score) / 3

    # Print the average grade
    print(f"The student's average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}")

# Call the function
calculate_average_grade()
