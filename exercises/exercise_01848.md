## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers and a function as input, and returns the result of applying the function to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the third element, and so on, until only one element remains.

## Reference Solution
```python
def foldl(f, l):
    """
    Applies function f to the first two elements of list l, then to the result and the next element, and so on.

    Args:
        f (function): A function that takes two arguments.
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        The result of the function application.
    """
    if len(l) == 1:
        return l[0]
    else:
        return foldl(f, [f(l[0], l[1])] + l[2:])

# Example usage
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def mul(x, y):
    return x * y

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result_add = foldl(add, numbers)
result_mul = foldl(mul, numbers)

print(result_add)  # Output: 15
print(result_mul)  # Output: 120
```

## Generated Output
```
15
120
```
