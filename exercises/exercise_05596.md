## Exercise
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their quotient.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide(dividend: float, divisor: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the quotient of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (float): The number being divided.
        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        float: The quotient of the two numbers.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return dividend / divisor

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        result = divide(10, 2)
        print("The quotient is:", result)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error:", e)
```

## Generated Output
```
The quotient is: 5.0
```
