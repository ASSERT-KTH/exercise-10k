## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the reversed list. The function should use array methods to reverse the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Version: 1.0
# Description: A function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the reversed list.

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        nums.reverse()
        return nums

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
