## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary as input where the keys are names of students and the values are lists of their scores in different subjects. The program should calculate the average score for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average scores as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_scores(student_scores):
    """
    This function calculates the average score for each student in a dictionary.
    
    Args:
        student_scores (dict): A dictionary where keys are names of students and values are lists of their scores in different subjects.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average scores as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average scores of students
    average_scores = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary
    for student, scores in student_scores.items():
        # Check if the list of scores is not empty to avoid division by zero error
        if len(scores) > 0:
            # Calculate the sum of scores for the current student
            total_score = sum(scores)
            
            # Calculate the average score by dividing the total score by the number of scores
            average_score = total_score / len(scores)
            
            # Store the average score in the average_scores dictionary
            average_scores[student] = average_score
    
    # Return the dictionary with average scores
    return average_scores

# Example usage:
student_scores = {
    'Alice': [90, 85, 95],
    'Bob': [80, 75, 85],
    'Charlie': [95, 90, 92]
}

average_scores = calculate_average_scores(student_scores)
print(average_scores)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'Alice': 90.0, 'Bob': 80.0, 'Charlie': 92.33333333333333}
```
