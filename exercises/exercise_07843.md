## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers using a loop. The program should ask the user for the value of n and then calculate the sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

# Importing Libraries
import math

# Function Definition
def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i**2
    return sum

# Main Program
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
result = sum_of_squares(n)
print("The sum of the squares of the first", n, "natural numbers is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the value of n: The sum of the squares of the first 5 natural numbers is: 55
```
