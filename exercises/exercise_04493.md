## Exercise
Create a function that generates a Mad Libs story based on user input. The function takes in several words (e.g. noun, verb, adjective) and inserts them into a story.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper_noun, place):
    """
    Generate a Mad Libs story based on user input.

    Args:
        noun (str): A noun (e.g. book, car, tree)
        verb (str): A verb (e.g. run, jump, read)
        adjective (str): An adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green)
        adverb (str): An adverb (e.g. quickly, loudly, wisely)
        proper_noun (str): A proper noun (e.g. John, New York, Google)
        place (str): A place (e.g. park, city, beach)

    Returns:
        str: The generated Mad Libs story
    """
    story = f"One day, {proper_noun} went to the {place} and saw a very {adjective} {noun}. " \
            f"They decided to {verb} {adverb} around it, feeling very happy and free. " \
            f"After a while, they sat down under a tree and {verb} for a bit, enjoying the beautiful view."
    return story

def main():
    noun = input("Enter a noun (e.g. book, car, tree): ")
    verb = input("Enter a verb (e.g. run, jump, read): ")
    adjective = input("Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): ")
    adverb = input("Enter an adverb (e.g. quickly, loudly, wisely): ")
    proper_noun = input("Enter a proper noun (e.g. John, New York, Google): ")
    place = input("Enter a place (e.g. park, city, beach): ")

    print("\nHere's your Mad Libs story:")
    print(generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper_noun, place))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a noun (e.g. book, car, tree): Enter a verb (e.g. run, jump, read): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpazovd92p.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpazovd92p.py", line 23, in main
    verb = input("Enter a verb (e.g. run, jump, read): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
