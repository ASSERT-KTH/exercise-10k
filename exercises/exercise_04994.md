## Exercise
Demonstrate the concept of variable shadowing with an example.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Outer scope
x = 10

def outer_function():
    # Inner scope
    x = 20  # This variable shadows the outer scope variable x

    def inner_function():
        # Innermost scope
        print("Innermost scope:", x)  # Prints 20

    inner_function()
    print("Inner scope:", x)  # Prints 20

outer_function()
print("Outer scope:", x)  # Prints 10
```

## Generated Output
```
Innermost scope: 20
Inner scope: 20
Outer scope: 10
```
