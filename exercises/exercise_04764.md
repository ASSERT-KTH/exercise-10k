## Exercise
Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and the computer generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'Tie'
    if (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock'):
        return 'User'
    return 'Computer'

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()
        if user_choice not in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nUser choice: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer choice: {computer_choice}\n")
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'Tie':
            print(f"It's a tie!")
        elif winner == 'User':
            print(f"You win! {user_choice} beats {computer_choice}.")
        else:
            print(f"Computer wins! {computer_choice} beats {user_choice}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit: 
User choice: Rock
Computer choice: Paper

Computer wins! Paper beats Rock.
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit:
