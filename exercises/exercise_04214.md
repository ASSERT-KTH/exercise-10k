## Exercise
Generate all permutations of an array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_permutations(arr):
    """
    Generate all permutations of an array.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input array.
    """
    # Base case: if the array has only one element, return it
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return [arr]

    permutations = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Choose the current element as the first element
        first = arr[i]
        # Generate all permutations of the remaining elements
        remaining = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]
        for p in generate_permutations(remaining):
            # Add the first element to the beginning of each permutation
            permutations.append([first] + p)

    return permutations

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3]
permutations = generate_permutations(arr)
for p in permutations:
    print(p)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 3]
[2, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 1]
```
