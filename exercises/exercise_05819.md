```python
def calculate_average_score(scores):
    """

        float: The average score.
    """
    total_score = 0
    for score in scores:
        total_score += score
    average_score = total_score / len(scores)
    return average_score

def main():
    # Example usage
    exam_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
    average = calculate_average_score(exam_scores)
    print(f"Exam Scores: {exam_scores}")
    print(f"Average Score: {average:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
