## Exercise
Develop a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
    for i in range(2, n):
        # Calculate the next term as the sum of the previous two terms
        next_term = fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2]
        # Append the next term to the sequence
        fib_sequence.append(next_term)

    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10  # Change this to generate a sequence of a different length
fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)
print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms: {fib_sequence}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
