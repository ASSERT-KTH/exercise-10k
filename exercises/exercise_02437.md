## Exercise
Create a program to administer a quiz, using a for loop to ask questions and a while loop to handle user responses.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Quiz Program

# Dictionary of questions and answers
questions = {
    "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": "Jupiter",
    "What is the smallest country in the world?": "Vatican City"
}

# Initialize score
score = 0

# Loop through each question
for question, answer in questions.items():
    print(question)
    
    # Initialize user response
    user_response = ""
    
    # Loop until user enters a valid response
    while user_response.lower() != answer.lower():
        user_response = input("Your answer: ")
        
        # Check if user wants to quit
        if user_response.lower() == "quit":
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            exit()
        
        # Check if user response is correct
        if user_response.lower() != answer.lower():
            print("Sorry, that's incorrect. Try again!")
    
    # If user response is correct, increment score
    score += 1
    print("Correct! You earn 1 point.\n")

# Print final score
print("Quiz over! Your final score is", score, "out of", len(questions))
```

## Generated Output
```
What is the capital of France?
Your answer: Sorry, that's incorrect. Try again!
Your answer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpog8py191.py", line 22, in <module>
    user_response = input("Your answer: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
