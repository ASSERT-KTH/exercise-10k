## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores. If the score is above 90, print 'A', between 80 and 90 print 'B', and so on.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculates the student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Example usage
    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]
    for score in scores:
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Score: 95, Grade: A
Score: 85, Grade: B
Score: 75, Grade: C
Score: 65, Grade: D
Score: 55, Grade: F
```
