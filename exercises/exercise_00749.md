## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grades as input and calculates their average grade

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade(grades):
    """
    Calculate the average grade from a list of grades.

    Args:
        grades (list): A list of grades.

    Returns:
        float: The average grade.
    """
    return sum(grades) / len(grades)


def main():
    # Get the number of grades from the user
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))

    # Initialize an empty list to store the grades
    grades = []

    # Get each grade from the user and add it to the list
    for i in range(num_grades):
        while True:
            try:
                grade = float(input(f"Enter grade {i+1}: "))
                if 0 <= grade <= 100:
                    grades.append(grade)
                    break
                else:
                    print("Grade must be between 0 and 100.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and print the average grade
    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)
    print(f"Your average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of grades: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxvx_jevx.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpxvx_jevx.py", line 16, in main
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '90 80 70'
```
