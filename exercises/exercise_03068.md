    Returns:
        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.
    """
    voting_age = 18
    return age >= voting_age


def main():
    # Get the person's age from the user
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")

    # Check if the person is eligible to vote
    if check_voting_eligibility(age):
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
