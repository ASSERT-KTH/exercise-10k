## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the user, where the user can choose to play again using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Tic Tac Toe game in Python

board = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # We will use a single list to represent the 3x3 board

def print_board():
    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])
    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])
    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])

    print()
    print(row1)
    print(row2)
    print(row3)
    print()

def check_win(player):
    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] == player:
            return True
    return False

def check_draw():
    return ' ' not in board

def main():
    while True:
        play_again = 'y'
        while play_again.lower() == 'y':
            board = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Reset the board
            current_player = 'X'
            while True:
                print_board()
                move = input("Player {}, enter your move (1-9): ".format(current_player))
                if board[int(move) - 1] == ' ':
                    board[int(move) - 1] = current_player
                    if check_win(current_player):
                        print_board()
                        print("Player {} wins! Congratulations!".format(current_player))
                        break
                    elif check_draw():
                        print_board()
                        print("It's a draw!")
                        break
                    current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'
                else:
                    print("Invalid move, try again.")
            play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (y/n): ")
        print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
