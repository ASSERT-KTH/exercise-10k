## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_two_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

# Example usage:
def main():
    num1 = 5.0
    num2 = 7.0
    result = sum_of_two_numbers(num1, num2)
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is 12.0.
```
