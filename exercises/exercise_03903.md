## Exercise
Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their division and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function calculates the division and remainder of two integers.
    
    Parameters:
    dividend (int): The number being divided.
    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.
    
    Returns:
    quotient (int): The result of the division.
    remainder (int): The remainder of the division.
    """
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    
    return quotient, remainder

def main():
    # Get user input
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
    
    # Check for division by zero
    if divisor == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxchw4wd7.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpxchw4wd7.py", line 20, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
