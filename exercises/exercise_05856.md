## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for two colors and then prints out the color that results from mixing them. Use the following mixing rules: red + blue = purple, blue + yellow = green, red + yellow = orange

## Reference Solution
```python
def mix_colors(color1, color2):
    """
    Mixes two colors based on the given rules.

    Args:
        color1 (str): The first color.
        color2 (str): The second color.

    Returns:
        str: The resulting color.
    """
    # Define the color mixing rules
    mixing_rules = {
        ("red", "blue"): "purple",
        ("blue", "red"): "purple",
        ("blue", "yellow"): "green",
        ("yellow", "blue"): "green",
        ("red", "yellow"): "orange",
        ("yellow", "red"): "orange"
    }

    # Check if the color combination is in the mixing rules
    if (color1.lower(), color2.lower()) in mixing_rules:
        return mixing_rules[(color1.lower(), color2.lower())]
    else:
        return "Unknown color combination"

def main():
    # Ask the user for two colors
    color1 = input("Enter the first color (red, blue, or yellow): ")
    color2 = input("Enter the second color (red, blue, or yellow): ")

    # Mix the colors and print the result
    result = mix_colors(color1, color2)
    print(f"The color that results from mixing {color1} and {color2} is {result}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first color (red, blue, or yellow): Enter the second color (red, blue, or yellow): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpulc06d5x.py", line 31, in main
    color2 = input("Enter the second color (red, blue, or yellow): ")
