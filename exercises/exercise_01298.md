## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary and a function, and returns a new dictionary where the key-value pairs are grouped by the result of applying the function to each key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def group_dict_by_key_func(input_dict, func):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary and a function as input, 
    and returns a new dictionary where the key-value pairs are grouped by the result of applying the function to each key.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary.
        func (function): A function that takes a key and returns a value.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with key-value pairs grouped by the result of applying the function to each key.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the result
    result = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        
        # Apply the function to the key to get the group name
        group_name = func(key)
        
        # If the group name is not already in the result dictionary, add it with an empty dictionary as its value
        if group_name not in result:
            # This is because we want to store all key-value pairs with the same group name in a dictionary
            result[group_name] = {}
        
        # Add the key-value pair to the dictionary of the corresponding group name
        result[group_name][key] = value
    
    # Return the resulting dictionary
    return result
```
