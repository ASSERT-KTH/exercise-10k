## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should take in the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal) and the amount. If the transaction type is 'deposit', the program should add the amount to the account balance. If the transaction type is 'withdrawal', the program should subtract the amount from the account balance, but only if the account balance is sufficient. If the account balance is not sufficient, the program should print an error message. The initial account balance is $1000.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.
        
        Args:
            initial_balance (float): The initial account balance.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.
        
        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.
        """
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account, if sufficient balance exists.
        
        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.
        """
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Error: Insufficient balance.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    # Initialize a BankAccount object with an initial balance of $1000
    account = BankAccount(1000)
    print(f"Initial balance: ${account.balance:.2f}")

    while True:
        # Get the transaction type from the user
        transaction_type = input("Enter transaction type (deposit/withdrawal) or 'quit' to exit: ")

        if transaction_type.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        # Get the transaction amount from the user
        try:
            amount = float(input("Enter transaction amount: $"))
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: Invalid amount. Please enter a valid number.")
            continue

        # Perform the transaction
        if transaction_type.lower() == 'deposit':
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif transaction_type.lower() == 'withdrawal':
            account.withdraw(amount)
        else:
            print("Error: Invalid transaction type. Please enter 'deposit' or 'withdrawal'.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Initial balance: $1000.00
Enter transaction type (deposit/withdrawal) or 'quit' to exit: Enter transaction amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
