## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), and score < 60 (F).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Course: [Course Name]

# Description: This program takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade.
# The grade is determined by the following conditions:
#   - A: score >= 90
#   - B: 80 <= score < 90
#   - C: 70 <= score < 80
#   - D: 60 <= score < 70
#   - F: score < 60

def determine_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    score = float(input("Enter a score: "))
    grade = determine_grade(score)
    print(f"A score of {score} is a {grade}.")

main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a score: A score of 85.0 is a B.
```
