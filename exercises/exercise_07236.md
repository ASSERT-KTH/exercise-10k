## Exercise
Create a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and outputs the result. The operator can be +, -, *, or /. Handle invalid inputs by printing an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculator():
    """
    A simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and outputs the result.
    The operator can be +, -, *, or /. It handles invalid inputs by printing an error message.
    """
    # Get user input
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        operator = input("Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

        # Perform the operation
        if operator == '+':
            result = num1 + num2
        elif operator == '-':
            result = num1 - num2
        elif operator == '*':
            result = num1 * num2
        elif operator == '/':
            # Check for division by zero
            if num2 != 0:
                result = num1 / num2
            else:
                print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
                return
        else:
            print("Error: Invalid operator. Only +, -, *, / are allowed.")
            return

        print(f"Result: {num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}")

    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Ask the user if they want to perform another operation
    another_operation = input("Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): ")
    if another_operation.lower() == 'yes':
        calculator()

# Call the function to start the calculator
calculator()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmptv9_2yb4.py", line 41, in <module>
    calculator()
  File "/tmp/tmptv9_2yb4.py", line 36, in calculator
    another_operation = input("Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
