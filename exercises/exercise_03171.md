## Exercise
Create a function that composes two other functions together.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose(f, g):
    """
    Compose two functions together.

    Args:
        f (function): The outer function.
        g (function): The inner function.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.
    """
    def h(x):
        return f(g(x))
    return h

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    """Double the input."""
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    """Add one to the input."""
    return x + 1

# Compose the functions
composed = compose(double, add_one)

# Test the composed function
print(composed(5))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
12
```
