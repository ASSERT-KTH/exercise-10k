## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should use a basic algorithm to iterate through the array and find the maximum value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max(a):
    max_val = a[0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > max_val:
            max_val = a[i]
    return max_val

# Example usage:
arr = [9, 7, 6, 1, 5, 4, 8, 2, 3]
print(max(arr))  # Output: 9
```

## Generated Output
```
9
```
