## Exercise
Develop a program that checks if a given building style is modern or traditional. The program should take the style as input and print 'Modern' or 'Traditional' based on the following criteria: modern (glass, steel), traditional (stone, brick).

## Reference Solution
```python
def classify_building_style(style):
    """
    Classify a building style as 'Modern' or 'Traditional' based on the materials used.

    Args:
        style (str): The building style to classify.

    Returns:
        str: 'Modern' or 'Traditional'
    """
    modern_materials = ['glass', 'steel']
    traditional_materials = ['stone', 'brick']

    style = style.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison

    if any(material in style for material in modern_materials):
        return 'Modern'
    elif any(material in style for material in traditional_materials):
        return 'Traditional'
    else:
        return 'Unknown'  # Return 'Unknown' if style does not match any criteria

def main():
    style = input("Enter a building style: ")
    classification = classify_building_style(style)
    print(classification)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a building style: Modern
```
