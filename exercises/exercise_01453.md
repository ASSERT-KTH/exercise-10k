## Exercise
Write a program that takes the original price and discount percentage as input and outputs the discounted price.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discounted price based on the original price and discount percentage.

    Args:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The discounted price.
    """
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price
    
    # Calculate the discounted price
    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount
    
    return discounted_price

def main():
    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

    # Calculate the discounted price
    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)

    # Print the discounted price
    print(f"The discounted price is: ${discounted_price:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the original price: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmporu9st95.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmporu9st95.py", line 22, in main
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 20'
```
