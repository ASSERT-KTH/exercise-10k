## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses a while loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1. The output should be on separate lines.

## Reference Solution
```python
for x in range(1, 11):
    print(x)

i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
```
