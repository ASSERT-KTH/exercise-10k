## Exercise
Write a program that takes a dictionary as input where keys are student names and values are lists of their scores in different subjects. The program should calculate the average score for each student and return a new dictionary with student names as keys and their average scores as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def average_score(students):
    scores = {}
    for student, grades in students.items():
        average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
        scores[student] = average
    return scores

students = {
    'Alice': [85, 90, 95],
    'Bob': [70, 80, 90],
    'Charlie': [60, 70, 80],
    'David': [90, 95, 100],
    'Eve': [80, 85, 90]
}

print(average_score(students))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'Alice': 90.0, 'Bob': 80.0, 'Charlie': 70.0, 'David': 95.0, 'Eve': 85.0}
```
