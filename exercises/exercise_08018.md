## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score in an exam. The program should have a function to calculate the grade and another function to display the grade. The grade is calculated as follows: score < 40 is F, 40-59 is D, 60-69 is C, 70-79 is B, and 80 or above is A.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (int): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score < 40:
        return 'F'
    elif score < 60:
        return 'D'
    elif score < 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score < 80:
        return 'B'
    else:
        return 'A'


def display_grade(score, grade):
    """
    Display the grade of a student.

    Args:
        score (int): The score of the student.
        grade (str): The grade of the student.
    """
    print(f"Score: {score}")
    print(f"Grade: {grade}")


def main():
    score = int(input("Enter the score of the student: "))
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    display_grade(score, grade)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score of the student: Score: 75
Grade: B
```
