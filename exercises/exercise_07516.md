## Exercise
Create a Word Scramble game using variables and string manipulation.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# List of words
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape"]

def scramble_word(word):
    """
    Scrambles a given word.
    """
    word_list = list(word)
    random.shuffle(word_list)
    return "".join(word_list)

def play_game():
    """
    Plays the Word Scramble game.
    """
    word = random.choice(words)
    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)
    print(f"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}")
    answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
    if answer.lower() == word:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer was {word}.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Word Scramble game!")
    while True:
        play_game()
        play_again = input("Would you like to play again? (yes/no): ")
        if play_again.lower() != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Word Scramble game!
Unscramble the word: dtae
Enter your answer: Incorrect. The correct answer was date.
Would you like to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpgxgn_jf3.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpgxgn_jf3.py", line 31, in main
    play_again = input("Would you like to play again? (yes/no): ")
