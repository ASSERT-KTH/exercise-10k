## Exercise
Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a specified element in an array with a new element. The program should take as input the array, the element to be replaced, and the new element. The program should output the modified array.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

def replace_element(arr, old_element, new_element):
    """
    Replace all occurrences of old_element in arr with new_element.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array.
        old_element: The element to be replaced.
        new_element: The new element to replace old_element.

    Returns:
        list: The modified array with all occurrences of old_element replaced.
    """
    new_arr = []
    for element in arr:
        if element == old_element:
            new_arr.append(new_element)
        else:
            new_arr.append(element)
    return new_arr

# Test the function
arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
old_element = 2
new_element = 10
print(replace_element(arr, old_element, new_element))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 10, 3, 10, 4, 10, 5]
```
