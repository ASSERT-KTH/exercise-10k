## Exercise
Create a function to analyze data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary will contain student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Check if the grades are stored in a list or dictionary
        if isinstance(grades, dict):
            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student
            total_grade = sum(grades.values())
            
            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of subjects
            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
        elif isinstance(grades, list):
            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student
            total_grade = sum(grades)
            
            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of grades
            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
        else:
            # If the grades are not stored in a list or dictionary, assume it's a single grade
            average_grade = grades

        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade

    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades for each student
    return average_grades


# Example usage:
grades_dict = {
    'John': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},
    'Alice': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 92},
    'Bob': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 75, 'English': 85}
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)
print(average_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90.0, 'Alice': 92.33333333333333, 'Bob': 80.0}
```
