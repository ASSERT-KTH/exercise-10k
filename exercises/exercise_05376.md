## Exercise
Write a program to find the difference of two or more lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def list_difference(*lists):
    """
    Find the difference of two or more lists.

    Args:
        *lists: Variable number of lists.

    Returns:
        A list of elements that are in the first list but not in any of the other lists.
    """
    if not lists:
        return []

    diff = set(lists[0])
    for lst in lists[1:]:
        diff -= set(lst)

    return list(diff)

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
list3 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

print("List 1:", list1)
print("List 2:", list2)
print("List 3:", list3)

print("Difference of List 1 and List 2:", list_difference(list1, list2))
print("Difference of List 1, List 2, and List 3:", list_difference(list1, list2, list3))
```

## Generated Output
```
List 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
List 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
List 3: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Difference of List 1 and List 2: [1, 2, 3]
Difference of List 1, List 2, and List 3: [1, 2, 3]
```
