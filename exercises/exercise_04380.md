## Exercise
Write a program that transforms a dictionary into a matrix representation.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

def dict_to_matrix(dictionary):
    """
    Transform a dictionary into a matrix representation.

    Parameters:
    dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
    matrix (numpy.ndarray): The matrix representation of the dictionary.
    """
    # Get the keys and values from the dictionary
    keys = list(dictionary.keys())
    values = list(dictionary.values())

    # Create a matrix with the keys as the first column and the values as the second column
    matrix = np.array([keys, values]).T

    return matrix

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a sample dictionary
    sample_dict = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}

    # Transform the dictionary into a matrix
    matrix = dict_to_matrix(sample_dict)

    # Print the resulting matrix
    print(matrix)
```

## Generated Output
```
[['A' '1']
 ['B' '2']
 ['C' '3']]
```
