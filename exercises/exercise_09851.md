## Exercise
Create a function that takes in a dictionary of student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and lists of grades as values.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student
        total_grade = sum(grades)
        
        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades
        average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
        
        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade
    
    # Return the dictionary with average grades for each student
    return average_grades

# Example usage:
grades = {
    "John": [90, 85, 95],
    "Alice": [88, 92, 89],
    "Bob": [76, 82, 81]
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades)
print(average_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90.0, 'Alice': 89.66666666666667, 'Bob': 79.66666666666667}
```
