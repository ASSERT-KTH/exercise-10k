## Exercise
Create a program that takes the current hour as input and prints the corresponding time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) based on the following criteria: morning (6-11), afternoon (12-16), evening (17-20), night (21-5) using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_time_of_day(hour):
    """
    Prints the time of day based on the given hour.

    Args:
        hour (int): The current hour in 24-hour format.
    """
    if 6 <= hour <= 11:
        print("It's morning.")
    elif 12 <= hour <= 16:
        print("It's afternoon.")
    elif 17 <= hour <= 20:
        print("It's evening.")
    else:
        print("It's night.")

def main():
    hour = int(input("Enter the current hour (0-23): "))
    print_time_of_day(hour)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current hour (0-23): It's afternoon.
```
