## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_median(numbers):
    """Calculate the median of a list of numbers."""
    numbers.sort()
    n = len(numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        median = (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        median = numbers[n // 2]
    return median

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers."""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main():
    # Example list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Calculate statistics
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)

    # Print results
    print("Mean:", mean)
    print("Median:", median)
    print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mean: 3.0
Median: 3
Standard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951
```
