## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(lst, condition):
    new_lst = []
    for element in lst:
        if condition(element):
            new_lst.append(element)
    return new_lst

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
condition = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(filter_list(lst, condition))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
