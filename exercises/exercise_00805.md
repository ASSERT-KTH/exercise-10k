    """
    # Check if the input is a single character
    if len(char) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a single character")

    # Get the ASCII value of the character
    ascii_value = ord(char)

    # Print the ASCII value
    print(f"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ascii_value}")


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    char = "A"
    print_ascii_value(char)
```
