## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the distance between two points given their coordinates.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
    
    Parameters:
    x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
    y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
    x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
    y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.
    
    Returns:
    float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

def main():
    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The distance between the two points is {distance:.2f} units.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpilchtlsf.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpilchtlsf.py", line 20, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'point1 = (1, 2), point2 = (4, 6)'
```
