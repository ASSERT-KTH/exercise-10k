def print_greetings(name: str, age: int) -> None:
    """Prints a greetings message with the provided name and age."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old. Welcome!")

def main() -> None:
    """Reads user input and prints a greetings message."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
    
    print_greetings(name, age)

if __name__ == "__main__":
