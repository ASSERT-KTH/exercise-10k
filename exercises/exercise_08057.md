## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to manage a bank account with loans based on user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance
        self.loan = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def take_loan(self, amount):
        self.loan += amount
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Took loan of ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def repay_loan(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds to repay loan.")
        elif amount > self.loan:
            print("Repayment amount exceeds outstanding loan.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            self.loan -= amount
            print(f"Repaid ${amount:.2f} of loan. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}, Outstanding loan: ${self.loan:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Management Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Take Loan")
        print("4. Repay Loan")
        print("5. Check Balance")
        print("6. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to take as loan: "))
            account.take_loan(amount)
        elif choice == "4":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to repay loan: "))
            account.repay_loan(amount)
        elif choice == "5":
            print(f"Current balance: ${account.balance:.2f}, Outstanding loan: ${account.loan:.2f}")
        elif choice == "6":
            print("Exiting program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
