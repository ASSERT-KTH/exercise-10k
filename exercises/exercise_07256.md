## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if the input is 'hello', the output should be 'olleh'. The program should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in reverse functions.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(input_str):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
    
    Args:
        input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.
    
    Returns:
        str: The reversed string.
    """
    
    # Initialize an empty string to store the reversed string
    reversed_str = ""
    
    # We will iterate over the input string from the end to the start
    # So, we start from the last index of the string and go down to 0
    # The range function generates indices from the end to the start of the string
    for i in range(len(input_str) - 1, -1, -1):
        
        # In each iteration, we append the character at the current index to the reversed string
        # This way, we build the reversed string character by character
        reversed_str += input_str[i]
    
    # After the loop finishes, the reversed string is complete
    # We return it as the result
    return reversed_str

# Test the function with an example
print(reverse_string('hello'))  # Output: olleh
```

## Generated Output
```
olleh
```
