## Exercise
Write a program that prints a weather forecast using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the weather forecast data
weather_forecast = {
    "Monday": "Sunny",
    "Tuesday": "Cloudy",
    "Wednesday": "Rainy",
    "Thursday": "Windy",
    "Friday": "Sunny"
}

# Initialize the day counter
day = 0

# Print the weather forecast using a while loop
while day < len(weather_forecast):
    # Get the current day and weather
    current_day = list(weather_forecast.keys())[day]
    current_weather = weather_forecast[current_day]

    # Print the weather forecast for the current day
    print(f"Weather forecast for {current_day}: {current_weather}")

    # Increment the day counter
    day += 1
```

## Generated Output
```
Weather forecast for Monday: Sunny
Weather forecast for Tuesday: Cloudy
Weather forecast for Wednesday: Rainy
Weather forecast for Thursday: Windy
Weather forecast for Friday: Sunny
```
