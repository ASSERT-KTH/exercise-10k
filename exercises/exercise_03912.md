## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the salary of an employee given their annual salary and number of months worked.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_salary(annual_salary, months_worked):
    """
    Calculates the salary of an employee given their annual salary and number of months worked.

    Args:
        annual_salary (float): The annual salary of the employee.
        months_worked (int): The number of months the employee has worked.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated salary.
    """
    # Calculate the monthly salary
    monthly_salary = annual_salary / 12

    # Calculate the total salary
    total_salary = monthly_salary * months_worked

    return total_salary


def main():
    # Get the annual salary from the user
    annual_salary = float(input("Enter the annual salary: "))

    # Get the number of months worked from the user
    months_worked = int(input("Enter the number of months worked: "))

    # Calculate the salary
    salary = calculate_salary(annual_salary, months_worked)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The employee's salary is: ${salary:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
