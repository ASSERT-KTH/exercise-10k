## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and end with the input number. Each line of the pattern should contain one more number than the previous line, and the numbers on each line should increase by 1. For example, if the input is 6, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2 3, 4 5 6

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pattern(n):
    """
    Prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    The pattern starts with 1 and ends with n. Each line of the pattern contains 
    one more number than the previous line, and the numbers on each line increase 
    by 1.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number up to which the pattern should be printed.
    """
    num = 1
    line_length = 1
    
    while num <= n:
        # Print numbers for the current line
        for _ in range(line_length):
            if num <= n:
                print(num, end=" ")
                num += 1
        
        # Move to the next line
        print()
        line_length += 1


# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print_pattern(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1 
2 3 
4 5 6
```
