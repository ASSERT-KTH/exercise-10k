## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(amount):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

    Args:
        amount (int): The amount to make change for.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of coins needed.
    """
    # Define the available coin denominations
    coins = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50]

    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins for each amount
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount

    # Iterate over each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            # Update the minimum number of coins for the current amount
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    # If no combination of coins can make the target amount, return -1
    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return dp[amount]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    amount = 37  # Example amount
    min_coins_needed = min_coins(amount)
    if min_coins_needed != -1:
        print(f"The minimum number of coins needed to make ${amount / 100:.2f} is {min_coins_needed}.")
    else:
        print(f"No combination of coins can make ${amount / 100:.2f}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The minimum number of coins needed to make $0.37 is 4.
```
