## Exercise
Write a function to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem, where the goal is to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def knapsack(capacity, weights, values):
    """
    Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

    Parameters:
    capacity (int): The maximum capacity of the knapsack.
    weights (list): A list of item weights.
    values (list): A list of item values.

    Returns:
    A tuple containing the maximum value that can be put in the knapsack and the items to include.
    """
    n = len(values)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i - 1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]

    # Reconstruct the solution
    max_value = dp[n][capacity]
    items = []
    w = capacity
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        if dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]:
            items.append(i - 1)
            w -= weights[i - 1]

    return max_value, items[::-1]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    capacity = 10
    weights = [3, 4, 5, 2]
    values = [10, 20, 30, 5]
    max_value, items = knapsack(capacity, weights, values)
    print(f"Maximum value: {max_value}")
    print(f"Items to include: {items}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Maximum value: 50
Items to include: [1, 2]
```
