## Exercise
Create a program that uses functions to simulate a simple calculator. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as input and return the result of the respective operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Simple Calculator Program

# Function to add two numbers
def add(x, y):
    print("Adding %d + %d" % (x, y))
    return x + y

# Function to subtract two numbers
def subtract(x, y):
    print("Subtracting %d - %d" % (x, y))
    return x - y

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(x, y):
    print("Multiplying %d * %d" % (x, y))
    return x * y

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(x, y):
    print("Dividing %d / %d" % (x, y))
    return x / y

# Main function
def main():
    print("Let's do some math with just functions!")

    age = add(30, 5)
    height = subtract(78, 4)
    weight = multiply(90, 2)
    iq = divide(100, 2)

    print("Age: %d, Height: %d, Weight: %d, IQ: %d" % (age, height, weight, iq))

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Let's do some math with just functions!
Adding 30 + 5
Subtracting 78 - 4
Multiplying 90 * 2
Dividing 100 / 2
Age: 35, Height: 74, Weight: 180, IQ: 50
```
