## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input, and then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should be printed to the console.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def area(length, width):
    result = length * width
    return result

# Function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
def perimeter(length, width):
    result = 2 * (length + width)
    return result

# Main program
def main():
    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

    # Calculate the area and perimeter
    area_result = area(length, width)
    perimeter_result = perimeter(length, width)

    # Print the results
    print("The area of the rectangle is:", area_result)
    print("The perimeter of the rectangle is:", perimeter_result)

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp7zjt2sku.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp7zjt2sku.py", line 14, in main
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5'
```
