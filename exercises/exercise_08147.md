## Exercise
Write a program that validates an IP address using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_ip(ip):
    # Split the IP address into its four parts
    parts = ip.split('.')

    # Check if the IP address has four parts
    if len(parts) != 4:
        return False

    # Check each part of the IP address
    for part in parts:
        # Check if the part is a digit
        if not part.isdigit():
            return False

        # Convert the part to an integer
        num = int(part)

        # Check if the part is within the valid range (0-255)
        if num < 0 or num > 255:
            return False

        # Check if the part has a leading zero
        if len(part) > 1 and part[0] == '0':
            return False

    # If all checks pass, the IP address is valid
    return True


# Test the function with some examples
ips = ['192.168.1.1', '255.255.255.255', '192.168.1', '192.168.1.256', '192.168.01.1']

for ip in ips:
    if validate_ip(ip):
        print(f'{ip} is a valid IP address.')
    else:
        print(f'{ip} is not a valid IP address.')
```

## Generated Output
```
192.168.1.1 is a valid IP address.
255.255.255.255 is a valid IP address.
192.168.1 is not a valid IP address.
192.168.1.256 is not a valid IP address.
192.168.01.1 is not a valid IP address.
