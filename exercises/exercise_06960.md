## Exercise
Create a function that takes a password as an argument and returns True if it is valid (length >= 8) and False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if a given password is valid based on its length.
    
    A password is considered valid if its length is 8 or more characters.
    
    Args:
        password (str): The password to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check the type of the input argument to ensure it's a string
    if not isinstance(password, str):
        raise TypeError("Password must be a string.")

    # Now, we can check the length of the password
    # We use the built-in len() function in Python to get the length of the string
    password_length = len(password)
    
    # According to the problem statement, a password is valid if its length is 8 or more
    # So, we use an if statement to check this condition
    # If the condition is met, we return True; otherwise, we return False
    if password_length >= 8:
        # The password is valid, so we return True
        return True
    else:
        # The password is not valid, so we return False
        return False

# Alternatively, you can simplify the function to just one line:
def check_password_simplified(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if a given password is valid based on its length.
    
    A password is considered valid if its length is 8 or more characters.
    
    Args:
        password (str): The password to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Check the type of the input argument
    if not isinstance(password, str):
        raise TypeError("Password must be a string.")
    
    # We can directly return the result of the comparison, which is a boolean value
    return len(password) >= 8
```
