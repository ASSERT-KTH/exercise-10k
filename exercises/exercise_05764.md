## Exercise
Create a program that takes the temperature as input and prints out a weather forecast based on the following conditions: hot (above 25), warm (15-24), cool (5-14), cold (below 5).

## Reference Solution
```python
def weather_forecast(temperature):
    """
    Prints out a weather forecast based on the given temperature.

    Args:
        temperature (int): The temperature in degrees Celsius.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    if temperature > 25:
        print("The weather is hot.")
    elif 15 <= temperature <= 24:
        print("The weather is warm.")
    elif 5 <= temperature <= 14:
        print("The weather is cool.")
    else:
        print("The weather is cold.")


def main():
    # Get the temperature from the user
    while True:
        try:
            temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Print out the weather forecast
    weather_forecast(temperature)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: The weather is warm.
```
