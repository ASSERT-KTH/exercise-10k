## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a given range using a loop. The program should ask the user for the start and end of the range and then print the sum of all numbers in that range.

## Reference Solution
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Get the range from the user
start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))

# Initialize sum
sum = 0

# Calculate the sum
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    sum += i

# Print the sum
print("The sum of the range is: ", sum)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the start of the range: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5kelvjy8.py", line 4, in <module>
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 10'
```
