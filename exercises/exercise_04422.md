## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess a secret number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def secret_number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the Secret Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # Keep asking the user for input until they guess the secret number
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Thanks for playing! The secret number was {}.".format(secret_number))
            break

        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == secret_number:
            print("Congratulations! You found the secret number in {} attempts.".format(attempts))
            break
        elif user_guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Too high! Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    secret_number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Secret Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too high! Try again.
Take a guess:
