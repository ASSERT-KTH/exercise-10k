## Exercise
Write a program that performs basic tuple operations such as indexing and slicing.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the original tuple
print("Original tuple: ", my_tuple)

# Indexing: Access the first element of the tuple
print("First element: ", my_tuple[0])

# Indexing: Access the last element of the tuple
print("Last element: ", my_tuple[-1])

# Slicing: Get the first three elements of the tuple
print("First three elements: ", my_tuple[:3])

# Slicing: Get the last two elements of the tuple
print("Last two elements: ", my_tuple[-2:])

# Slicing: Get all elements except the first and last
print("All elements except first and last: ", my_tuple[1:-1])

# Slicing: Get every other element starting from the first
print("Every other element starting from the first: ", my_tuple[::2])

# Slicing: Get every other element starting from the second
print("Every other element starting from the second: ", my_tuple[1::2])

# Slicing: Reverse the tuple
print("Reversed tuple: ", my_tuple[::-1])
```

## Generated Output
```
Original tuple:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
First element:  1
Last element:  5
First three elements:  (1, 2, 3)
Last two elements:  (4, 5)
All elements except first and last:  (2, 3, 4)
Every other element starting from the first:  (1, 3, 5)
Every other element starting from the second:  (2, 4)
Reversed tuple:  (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
```
