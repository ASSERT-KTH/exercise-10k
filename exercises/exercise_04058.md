## Exercise
Write a function that takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from both dictionaries.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function merges two dictionaries into a new dictionary.
    
    If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first dictionary.
    
    Parameters:
    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.
    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A new dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
    """

    # First, we'll create a copy of the first dictionary. This is to avoid modifying the original dictionary.
    merged_dict = dict1.copy()
    
    # Then, we'll update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary.
    # If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first dictionary.
    merged_dict.update(dict2)
    
    # Finally, we'll return the merged dictionary.
    return merged_dict

# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
print(merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
