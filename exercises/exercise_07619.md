## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to simulate a game of rock paper scissors between the user and the computer.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "User wins!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0
    play_again = 'y'

    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")

        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        print(result)

        if result == "User wins!":
            user_score += 1
        elif result == "Computer wins!":
            computer_score += 1

        print(f"\nScore - User: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\n")
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (y/n): ")

    print("\nThanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
Computer chose: rock
It's a tie!

Score - User: 0, Computer: 0

Do you want to play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
