## Exercise
Write a function that rotates a given list by k positions to the right.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_list(lst, k):
    """
    Rotate a list to the right by k positions.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to be rotated.
        k (int): The number of positions to rotate.

    Returns:
        list: The rotated list.
    """
    k = k % len(lst)  # Handle cases where k is greater than the list length
    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]

# Example usage:
def main():
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    k = 2
    print("Original List:", lst)
    print("Rotated List:", rotate_list(lst, k))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Rotated List: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
