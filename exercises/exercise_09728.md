## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their mode.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def calculate_mode(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of modes (in case of multiple modes).
    """
    # Count the frequency of each number
    counts = Counter(numbers)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_count = max(counts.values())

    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency
    modes = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]

    return modes

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)
    print("Mode(s):", modes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mode(s): [4]
```
