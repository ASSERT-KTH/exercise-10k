## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program should use a while loop to keep asking for input until the correct number is guessed, and provide hints to the user if their guess is too high or too low.

## Reference Solution
```python
<?php

function guess_number() {
  $number = rand(0, 100);
  $tries = 0;

  while (true) {
    $guess = readline("Guess a number between 0 and 100: ");
    $guess = (int)$guess;

    $tries++;

    if ($guess > $number) {
      echo "Too high!" . "\n";
    } elseif ($guess < $number) {
      echo "Too low!" . "\n";
    } else {
      echo "Congratulations! You guessed the number in $tries tries." . "\n";
      break;
    }
  }
}

guess_number();

?>
```
