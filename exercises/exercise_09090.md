## Exercise
Create a program that takes an integer grade as input and outputs whether it is passing or failing based on the following conditions: grade 70 and above is passing, below 70 is failing. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade(grade):
    """
    Checks if a grade is passing or failing.

    Args:
        grade (int): The grade to be checked.

    Returns:
        str: "Passing" if the grade is 70 or above, "Failing" otherwise.
    """
    if grade >= 70:
        return "Passing"
    else:
        return "Failing"

# Example usage:
grade = int(input("Enter your grade: "))
result = check_grade(grade)
print(f"Your grade is {result}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your grade: Your grade is Passing.
```
