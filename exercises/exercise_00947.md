## Exercise
Write a program that prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_odd_index_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # Check if the index is odd
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(numbers[i])

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print("Numbers with odd indices:")
print_odd_index_numbers(numbers)
```

```python
def print_odd_index_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    """
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        # Check if the index is odd
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(num)

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print("Numbers with odd indices:")
print_odd_index_numbers(numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Numbers with odd indices:
2
4
6
8
10
```
