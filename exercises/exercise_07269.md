## Exercise
Write a program that takes a score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Read a score from the user
score = int(input("Enter a score: "))

# Determine the grade
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Print the grade
print("Your grade is: ", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a score: Your grade is:  B
```
