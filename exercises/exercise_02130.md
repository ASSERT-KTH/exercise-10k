## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the same elements in reverse order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_list(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the same elements in reverse order.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be reversed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with the elements of the input list in reverse order.
    """

    # We will use list slicing to create a new list that is the reverse of the input list
    # The syntax for list slicing is [start:stop:step], where start is the starting index, 
    # stop is the ending index, and step is the increment between indices
    # By using ::-1, we are starting at the end of the list and moving backwards to the beginning, 
    # effectively reversing the list
    reversed_list = input_list[::-1]

    # Now we return the new list
    return reversed_list

# Test the function
print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
