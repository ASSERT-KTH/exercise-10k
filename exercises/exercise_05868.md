## Exercise
Create a new list with only the elements that meet a certain condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(original_list, condition):
    """
    Create a new list with only the elements that meet a certain condition.

    Args:
        original_list (list): The original list to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with only the elements that meet the condition.
    """
    return [element for element in original_list if condition(element)]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Define a condition function
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Filter the list
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, is_even)

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
