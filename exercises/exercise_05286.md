## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount, using a set of available coin denominations. Use a while loop to try different combinations of coins.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the necessary modules
import sys

# Define the function minCoins()
def minCoins(coins, m):
    # Initialize the minimum number of coins needed to make change for each amount from 0 to m
    minCoins = [sys.maxsize] * (m + 1)

    # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make change for 0 amount
    minCoins[0] = 0

    # Iterate through each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # Iterate through each amount from the coin denomination to m
        for i in range(coin, m + 1):
            # Update the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the current amount
            minCoins[i] = min(minCoins[i], minCoins[i - coin] + 1)

    # Return the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount m
    return minCoins[m]

# Test the function
coins = [1, 2, 5]
m = 11
print("Minimum number of coins needed:", minCoins(coins, m))
```

## Generated Output
```
Minimum number of coins needed: 3
```
