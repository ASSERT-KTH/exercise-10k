## Exercise
Create a program that defines and uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the corresponding operation. The program should then use these functions to calculate and print the results of the operations given the sample inputs.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define add function
def add(x, y):
    print(f"Adding {x} + {y}")
    return x + y

# Define subtract function
def subtract(x, y):
    print(f"Subtracting {y} from {x}")
    return x - y

# Define multiply function
def multiply(x, y):
    print(f"Multiplying {x} * {y}")
    return x * y

# Define divide function
def divide(x, y):
    print(f"Dividing {x} / {y}")
    return x / y

# Test the functions
print("Let's do some math with just functions!")

age = add(30, 5)
height = subtract(78, 4)
weight = multiply(90, 2)
iq = divide(100, 2)

print(f"Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Weight: {weight}, IQ: {iq}")
```

```python
Let's do some math with just functions!
Adding 30 + 5
Subtracting 4 from 78
Multiplying 90 * 2
Dividing 100 / 2
Age: 35, Height: 74, Weight: 180, IQ: 50.0
```

## Generated Output
```
Let's do some math with just functions!
Adding 30 + 5
Subtracting 4 from 78
Multiplying 90 * 2
Dividing 100 / 2
Age: 35, Height: 74, Weight: 180, IQ: 50.0
```
