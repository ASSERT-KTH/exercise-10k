## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Check for negative numbers
    elif n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)


# Example usage
def main():
    num = 5
    try:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
