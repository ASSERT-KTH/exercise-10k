## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number to be divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    # Take input from the user
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    # Check for division by zero
    if divisor == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        # Calculate the quotient and remainder
        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)

        # Print the result
        print(f"The quotient of {dividend} and {divisor} is {quotient}.")
        print(f"The remainder of {dividend} and {divisor} is {remainder}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpuwz8g19x.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpuwz8g19x.py", line 19, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
