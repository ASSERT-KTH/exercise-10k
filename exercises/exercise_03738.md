## Exercise
Create a program that takes an email address as input, checks if it's valid, and prints out a success message if it is.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    """
    Validate an email address.

    Args:
        email (str): The email address to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Regular expression for validating an email
    regex = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
    if re.match(regex, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    # Get the email address from the user
    email = input("Enter your email address: ")

    # Validate the email address
    if validate_email(email):
        print("Email address is valid.")
    else:
        print("Email address is not valid.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
