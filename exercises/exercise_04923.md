## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. The program should use the formula A = πr^2 to calculate the area.

## Reference Solution
```python
# import the math module for mathematical functions
import math

# define a function called area that takes one parameter: radius
def area(radius):
    # calculate the area using the formula A = πr^2
    A = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    
    # return the calculated area
    return A

# call the area function with radius = 5
print(area(5))
```

## Generated Output
```
78.53981633974483
