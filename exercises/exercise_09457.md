## Exercise
Write a program that generates a sequence of numbers (e.g. Fibonacci, factorial, etc.)

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates a Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

def main():
    # Get the number of terms from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence
    sequence = fibonacci(n)

    # Print the sequence
    print("Fibonacci sequence up to {} terms:".format(n))
    print(sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms: Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
