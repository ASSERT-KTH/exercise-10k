## Exercise
Write a program that takes the amount of money as input and calculates the number of coins of each denomination (1, 5, 10, 25) needed to make the change using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_change(amount):
    """
    Calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change.

    Args:
        amount (int): The amount of money to make change for.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Define the denominations
    denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]

    # Initialize the count of coins for each denomination
    coin_count = {denomination: 0 for denomination in denominations}

    # Calculate the number of coins of each denomination
    for denomination in denominations:
        coin_count[denomination] = amount // denomination
        amount %= denomination

    # Print the result
    for denomination, count in coin_count.items():
        print(f"{denomination} cents: {count} coin(s)")


def main():
    # Get the amount from the user
    amount = int(input("Enter the amount of money (in cents): "))

    # Calculate and print the change
    calculate_change(amount)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount of money (in cents): 25 cents: 1 coin(s)
10 cents: 1 coin(s)
5 cents: 0 coin(s)
1 cents: 2 coin(s)
```
