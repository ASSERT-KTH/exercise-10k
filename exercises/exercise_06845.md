## Exercise
Create a program that determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements. The program should take an integer as input and print out 'Positive' if the number is greater than 0, 'Negative' if the number is less than 0, and 'Zero' if the number is equal to 0.

## Reference Solution
```python
# input
x = int(input())

# conditional statements
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

## Generated Output
```
Positive
```
