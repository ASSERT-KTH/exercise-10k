## Exercise
Write a program to perform basic tuple operations (indexing, slicing, concatenation, repetition) on a given tuple

## Reference Solution
```python
def tuple_operations():
    # Initialize a tuple
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    # Indexing
    print("Indexing:")
    print("Element at index 0:", my_tuple[0])
    print("Element at index -1:", my_tuple[-1])

    # Slicing
    print("\nSlicing:")
    print("Elements from index 1 to 3:", my_tuple[1:4])
    print("Elements from index 2 to the end:", my_tuple[2:])
    print("Elements from the start to index 3:", my_tuple[:4])
    print("All elements:", my_tuple[:])

    # Concatenation
    print("\nConcatenation:")
    tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
    tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
    concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
    print("Concatenated tuple:", concatenated_tuple)

    # Repetition
    print("\nRepetition:")
    repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 2
    print("Repeated tuple:", repeated_tuple)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tuple_operations()
```

## Generated Output
```
Indexing:
Element at index 0: 1
Element at index -1: 5

Slicing:
Elements from index 1 to 3: (2, 3, 4)
Elements from index 2 to the end: (3, 4, 5)
Elements from the start to index 3: (1, 2, 3, 4)
All elements: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Concatenation:
Concatenated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Repetition:
Repeated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
