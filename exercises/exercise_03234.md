## Exercise
Write a program to rearrange an array such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rearrange_array(arr):
    # Separate even and odd numbers into two lists
    even = [num for num in arr if num % 2 == 0]
    odd = [num for num in arr if num % 2 != 0]

    # Combine even and odd lists to form the final rearranged array
    rearranged = even + odd

    return rearranged


# Test the function
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Rearranged array:", rearrange_array(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Rearranged array: [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
```
