## Exercise
Write a program that takes the speed and time of an object as input and returns the distance traveled.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_distance(speed, time):
    """
    Calculate the distance traveled by an object given its speed and time.

    Args:
        speed (float): The speed of the object in meters per second.
        time (float): The time the object traveled in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The distance traveled by the object in meters.
    """
    distance = speed * time
    return distance

def main():
    # Get the speed and time from the user
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed of the object in meters per second: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time the object traveled in seconds: "))

    # Calculate and print the distance
    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)
    print(f"The object traveled {distance} meters.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the speed of the object in meters per second: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpr6jz2nu6.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpr6jz2nu6.py", line 17, in main
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed of the object in meters per second: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 2'
```
