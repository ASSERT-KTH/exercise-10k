## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for the type of fruit they want to buy and the quantity they want to purchase. Then, calculate the total cost based on the following prices: apples ($1.00 each), bananas ($0.50 each), oranges ($1.50 each). Print out the total cost

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(fruit_type, quantity):
    """
    Calculates the total cost of the fruit based on the given prices.

    Args:
        fruit_type (str): The type of fruit.
        quantity (int): The quantity of fruit.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost.
    """
    prices = {
        "apples": 1.00,
        "bananas": 0.50,
        "oranges": 1.50
    }

    if fruit_type in prices:
        return prices[fruit_type] * quantity
    else:
        return None

def main():
    print("Available fruits: apples, bananas, oranges")
    fruit_type = input("Enter the type of fruit you want to buy: ").lower()
    while True:
        try:
            quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity you want to purchase: "))
            if quantity <= 0:
                print("Quantity must be a positive integer.")
                continue
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid quantity. Please enter a positive integer.")

    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(fruit_type, quantity)

    if total_cost is not None:
        print(f"The total cost of {quantity} {fruit_type} is: ${total_cost:.2f}")
    else:
        print("Invalid fruit type. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Available fruits: apples, bananas, oranges
Enter the type of fruit you want to buy: Enter the quantity you want to purchase: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
