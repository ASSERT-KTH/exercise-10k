## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the sum of squares of all integers in an array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(array):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers in an array.

    Args:
        array (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of all integers in the array.
    """
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in array)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print("Sum of squares:", result)
```

## Generated Output
