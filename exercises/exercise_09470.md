## Exercise
Create a program that generates a Mad Libs story based on user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input for a specific word type
def get_word(prompt):
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:
            return word
        else:
            print("Please enter a word.")

# Define a function to generate the Mad Libs story
def generate_mad_libs_story():
    print("Welcome to the Mad Libs story generator!")
    print("Please provide the following words:")

    # Get user input for different word types
    name = get_word("Enter a name: ")
    adjective1 = get_word("Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, purple): ")
    adjective2 = get_word("Enter another adjective: ")
    adjective3 = get_word("Enter one more adjective: ")
    noun1 = get_word("Enter a noun (e.g. book, car, apple): ")
    noun2 = get_word("Enter another noun: ")
    animal = get_word("Enter an animal: ")
    food = get_word("Enter a food: ")

    # Define the Mad Libs story template
    story_template = f"""
One day, {name} was walking through the forest when they came across a {adjective1} {noun1}.
It was so {adjective2} that {name} couldn't help but {adjective3} with excitement.
As they approached the {noun1}, a {animal} jumped out from behind it and started to {food}.
{name} was so surprised that they {food} all over their shirt.
It was a {adjective1} day, but {name} didn't let it ruin their {adjective2} mood.
"""

    # Print the generated Mad Libs story
    print("\nHere is your Mad Libs story:")
    print(story_template)

# Main function
def main():
    generate_mad_libs_story()

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
