## Exercise
Create a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. Use if/else statements to determine the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_player_choice(player_name):
    """Get the player's choice."""
    while True:
        choice = input(f"{player_name}, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        if choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the player's choices."""
    if player1_choice == player2_choice:
        return "tie"
    elif (player1_choice == "rock" and player2_choice == "scissors") or \
         (player1_choice == "scissors" and player2_choice == "paper") or \
         (player1_choice == "paper" and player2_choice == "rock"):
        return "player1"
    else:
        return "player2"

def play_game():
    """Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game."""
    player1_score = 0
    player2_score = 0
    round_num = 1

    while player1_score < 2 and player2_score < 2:
        print(f"\nRound {round_num}:")
        player1_choice = get_player_choice("Player 1")
        player2_choice = get_player_choice("Player 2")

        print(f"\nPlayer 1 chose: {player1_choice}")
        print(f"Player 2 chose: {player2_choice}")

        winner = determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice)
        if winner == "tie":
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif winner == "player1":
            print("Player 1 wins this round!")
            player1_score += 1
        else:
            print("Player 2 wins this round!")
            player2_score += 1

        print(f"\nScore - Player 1: {player1_score}, Player 2: {player2_score}")
        round_num += 1

    if player1_score == 2:
        print("\nPlayer 1 wins the game!")
    else:
        print("\nPlayer 2 wins the game!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Round 1:
Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): Invalid choice. Please try again.
Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors):
