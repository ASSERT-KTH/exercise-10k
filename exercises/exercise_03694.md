## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the net salary of an employee given the gross salary, tax rate, and deductions.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions):
    """
    Calculate the net salary of an employee.

    Args:
    - gross_salary (float): The gross salary of the employee.
    - tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 20% = 0.2).
    - deductions (float): The total deductions from the employee's salary.

    Returns:
    - net_salary (float): The net salary of the employee.
    """

    # Calculate the tax amount
    tax_amount = gross_salary * tax_rate

    # Calculate the net salary by subtracting the tax amount and deductions from the gross salary
    net_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount - deductions

    return net_salary


def main():
    # Get the gross salary from the user
    gross_salary = float(input("Enter the gross salary: "))

    # Get the tax rate from the user
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 20 for 20%): ")) / 100

    # Get the deductions from the user
    deductions = float(input("Enter the total deductions: "))

    # Calculate and print the net salary
    net_salary = calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions)
    print(f"The net salary is: ${net_salary:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the gross salary: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmplzz8hw99.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmplzz8hw99.py", line 25, in main
    gross_salary = float(input("Enter the gross salary: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'gross salary = 5000, tax rate = 10, deductions = 500'
