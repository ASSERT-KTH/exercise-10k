## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements that are common to both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def commonElements(a, b):
    """
    Return a list of elements that are common to both input lists, a and b.

    :param a: The first input list
    :param b: The second input list
    :return: A new list containing the common elements
    """
    res = []
    for i in a:
        if i in b:
            res.append(i)
    return res

def main():
    a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7]
    b = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]
    res = commonElements(a, b)
    print("Common elements:", res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Common elements: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]
```
