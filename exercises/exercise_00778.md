## Exercise
Write a program that counts the occurrences of a given character in a string and prints out the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_char(string, char):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of a given character in a string.
    
    Parameters:
    string (str): The string to search in.
    char (str): The character to search for.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.
    """
    return string.count(char)

def main():
    # Get the string and character from the user
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
    
    # Count the occurrences of the character
    count = count_char(string, char)
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"The character '{char}' occurs {count} times in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Enter a character: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6p0zjq1_.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6p0zjq1_.py", line 17, in main
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
