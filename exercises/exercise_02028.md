## Exercise
Develop a program that determines a person's age category based on their age. The program should use if/else statements to determine the age category.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_age_category(age):
    """
    Determine the age category based on the given age.

    Args:
        age (int): The age of the person.

    Returns:
        str: The age category.
    """
    if age < 0:
        return "Invalid age"
    elif age <= 1:
        return "Infant"
    elif age <= 3:
        return "Toddler"
    elif age <= 5:
        return "Preschooler"
    elif age <= 12:
        return "School-age child"
    elif age <= 19:
        return "Teenager"
    elif age <= 29:
        return "Young adult"
    elif age <= 64:
        return "Adult"
    else:
        return "Senior citizen"

def main():
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    category = determine_age_category(age)
    print(f"Your age category is: {category}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
