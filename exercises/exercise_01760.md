## Exercise
Write a program to find the cartesian product of two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
import itertools

def cartesian_product(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the cartesian product of two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is an ordered pair from the cartesian product.
    """
    return list(itertools.product(arr1, arr2))

def main():
    # Example usage:
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    result = cartesian_product(arr1, arr2)
    print("Cartesian Product:")
    for pair in result:
        print(pair)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Cartesian Product:
(1, 'a')
(1, 'b')
(1, 'c')
(2, 'a')
(2, 'b')
(2, 'c')
(3, 'a')
(3, 'b')
(3, 'c')
```
