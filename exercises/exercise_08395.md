## Exercise
Write a program that takes an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the grade
def calculateGrade(score):
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
        grade = "D"
    else:
        grade = "F"
    return grade

# Prompt the user for input
score = int(input("Enter the score: "))

# Call the function and print the result
print("Grade:", calculateGrade(score))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score: Grade: B
```
