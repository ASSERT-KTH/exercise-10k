## Exercise
Read an array of numbers from the user and calculate the average of the array

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculates the average of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Read the array of numbers from the user
    user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    try:
        numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split()]
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")
        return

    # Calculate the average
    average = calculate_average(numbers)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: The average of the numbers is: 20.00
