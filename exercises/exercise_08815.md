## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user to input their name and age, stores the name as a string and the age as an integer, then prints out a greeting message with the name and age. The program should also convert the age to a float and print out the age with two decimal places.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Input and Output
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Printing
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Floating Point Numbers
float_age = float(age)
print(f"You are {float_age:.2f} years old.")
```

## Generated Output
```
What is your name? How old are you? Hello, John Doe! You are 25 years old.
You are 25.00 years old.
```
