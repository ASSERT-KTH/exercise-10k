## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to respond to user input based on the sentiment of the message.

## Reference Solution
```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Download required NLTK data
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

def analyze_sentiment(message):
    """
    Analyze the sentiment of a message using VADER sentiment analysis.
    
    Args:
        message (str): The input message to analyze.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the sentiment scores.
    """
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(message)
    return sentiment_scores

def respond_to_sentiment(sentiment_scores):
    """
    Respond to the user based on the sentiment of their message.
    
    Args:
        sentiment_scores (dict): A dictionary containing the sentiment scores.
    
    Returns:
        str: A response based on the sentiment of the message.
    """
    compound_score = sentiment_scores['compound']
    
    if compound_score >= 0.05:
        # Positive sentiment
        return "I'm glad to hear that! How can I assist you further?"
    elif compound_score <= -0.05:
        # Negative sentiment
        return "Sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?"
    else:
        # Neutral sentiment
        return "Thank you for sharing. How can I assist you today?"

def main():
    # Get user input
    message = input("Please enter a message: ")
    
    # Analyze sentiment
    sentiment_scores = analyze_sentiment(message)
    
    # Respond to sentiment
    response = respond_to_sentiment(sentiment_scores)
    
    # Print response
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
