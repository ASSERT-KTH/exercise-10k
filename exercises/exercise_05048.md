## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the median of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_median(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the numbers.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate median of an empty list")

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(numbers)

    # If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle number
    if n % 2 == 1:
        median = numbers[n // 2]
    # If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers
    else:
        median = (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2

    return median

# Example usage:
numbers = [12, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 15]
median = calculate_median(numbers)
print("Median:", median)
```

## Generated Output
```
Median: 5.5
```
