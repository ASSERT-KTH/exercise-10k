## Exercise
Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def array_intersection(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Find the intersection of two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The intersection of the two arrays.
    """
    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(array_intersection(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [4, 5]
```

```python
def array_intersection_ordered(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Find the intersection of two arrays, preserving the original order.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: The intersection of the two arrays, in the original order.
    """
    return [x for x in arr1 if x in arr2]

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(array_intersection_ordered(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5]
```
