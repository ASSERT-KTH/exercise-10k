## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is the same as the original string (i.e., it's a palindrome). The program should print 'Yes' if the string is a palindrome and 'No' otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    if s == s[::-1]:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

is_palindrome(input())
```

## Generated Output
```
Yes
```
