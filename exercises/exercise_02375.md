## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and time taken.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_speed(distance, time):
    """
    Calculate the speed of an object given the distance traveled and time taken.

    Args:
        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object in meters.
        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.
    """
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero.")
    speed = distance / time
    return speed

def main():
    # Get user input
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in meters: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time taken in seconds: "))

    # Calculate speed
    try:
        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)
        print(f"The speed of the object is {speed:.2f} meters per second.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance traveled in meters: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpp_nk_did.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpp_nk_did.py", line 19, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in meters: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 5'
```
