## Exercise
Create a function to find the difference of two dictionaries and return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in the first dictionary but not in the second dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dict_difference(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function calculates the difference between two dictionaries.
    
    It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in the first dictionary but not in the second dictionary.
    
    Parameters:
    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the difference
    diff_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the first dictionary
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        # Check if the key is not present in the second dictionary or its value is different
        if key not in dict2 or value != dict2[key]:
            # Add the key-value pair to the difference dictionary
            diff_dict[key] = value
    
    # Return the difference dictionary
    return diff_dict

# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}
print(dict_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```
