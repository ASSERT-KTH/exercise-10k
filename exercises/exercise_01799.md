## Exercise
Create a function to partition a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a given condition and return the resulting partitioned dictionaries.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_dict(input_dict, condition):
    """
    Partitions a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be partitioned.
        condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns True or False.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple of two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains the key-value pairs for which the condition is True, 
               and the second dictionary contains the key-value pairs for which the condition is False.
    """

    # Initialize two empty dictionaries to store the partitioned key-value pairs
    dict_true = {}
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs for which the condition is False
    dict_false = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # Check the condition for the current key-value pair
        if condition(key, value):
            # If the condition is True, add the key-value pair to dict_true
            dict_true[key] = value
        else:
            # If the condition is False, add the key-value pair to dict_false
            dict_false[key] = value

    # Return the two partitioned dictionaries as a tuple
    return dict_true, dict_false


# Example usage:
# Define a condition function that checks if the value is greater than 10
def condition(key, value):
    return value > 10

# Create a sample dictionary
sample_dict = {'a': 5, 'b': 15, 'c': 8, 'd': 20}

# Partition the dictionary using the condition function
dict_true, dict_false = partition_dict(sample_dict, condition)

# Print the partitioned dictionaries
print("Dictionary with values greater than 10:", dict_true)
print("Dictionary with values less than or equal to 10:", dict_false)
```

## Generated Output
```
Dictionary with values greater than 10: {'b': 15, 'd': 20}
Dictionary with values less than or equal to 10: {'a': 5, 'c': 8}
```
