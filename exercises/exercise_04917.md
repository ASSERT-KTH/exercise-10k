```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int start, length, i;

    cout << "Enter the starting number: ";
    cin >> start;

    cout << "Enter the sequence length: ";
    cin >> length;

    for (i = 1; i <= length; i++) {
        cout << start << endl;
        start = start + 2;
    }
