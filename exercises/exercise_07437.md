## Exercise
Create a program that asks for a student's grade and checks if it is passing (60 or above) or failing. If the grade is passing, print 'Passing', otherwise print 'Failing'. Additionally, check if the grade is an A (90 or above), B (80-89), C (70-79), or D (60-69) and print the corresponding letter grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade():
    """
    Asks for a student's grade and checks if it is passing or failing.
    If the grade is passing, prints 'Passing', otherwise prints 'Failing'.
    Additionally, checks the letter grade (A, B, C, D) and prints it.
    """
    # Ask for the student's grade
    while True:
        try:
            grade = float(input("Please enter the student's grade: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Check if the grade is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
        print("Invalid grade. Grade should be between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        # Check if the grade is passing or failing
        if grade >= 60:
            print("Passing")
        else:
            print("Failing")

        # Check the letter grade
        if grade >= 90:
            print("Letter Grade: A")
        elif grade >= 80:
            print("Letter Grade: B")
        elif grade >= 70:
            print("Letter Grade: C")
        elif grade >= 60:
            print("Letter Grade: D")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_grade()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the student's grade: Passing
Letter Grade: B
```
