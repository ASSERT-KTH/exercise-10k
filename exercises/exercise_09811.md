## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to count the number of prime numbers between 1 and a given number (inclusive). A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_primes(n):
    # Initialize a counter for prime numbers
    prime_count = 0

    # Iterate over all numbers from 2 to n (inclusive)
    for num in range(2, n + 1):
        # Assume the number is prime
        is_prime = True

        # Check for divisors other than 1 and the number itself
        for divisor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % divisor == 0:
                # If a divisor is found, the number is not prime
                is_prime = False
                break

        # If the number is prime, increment the counter
        if is_prime:
            prime_count += 1

    return prime_count


def main():
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"Number of prime numbers between 1 and {n} (inclusive): {count_primes(n)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: Number of prime numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive): 4
```
