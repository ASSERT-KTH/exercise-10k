## Exercise
Write a program to create a new list using list comprehension and print the resulting list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Create a new list using list comprehension
    even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
    
    # Print the resulting list
    print("List of even squares:", even_squares)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
List of even squares: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```
