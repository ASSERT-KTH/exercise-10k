## Exercise
Calculate the variance given a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_variance(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The variance of the list of numbers.
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the list
    mean = np.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the variance using the formula
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)
    
    return variance

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
print("Variance:", variance)
```

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_variance(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers using NumPy.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The variance of the list of numbers.
    """
    return np.var(numbers, ddof=1)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
print("Variance:", variance)
```

## Generated Output
```
Variance: 2.5
```
