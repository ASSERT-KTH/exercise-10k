## Exercise
Write a program that takes four numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. The program should then output the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

void operation(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    int addition = a + b + c + d;
    int subtraction = a - b - c - d;
    int multiplication = a * b * c * d;
    int division = (float)a / (float)b / (float)c / (float)d;

    std::cout << "a + b + c + d = " << addition << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a - b - c - d = " << subtraction << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a * b * c * d = " << multiplication << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a / b / c / d = " << division << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d;
    std::cout << "Enter four numbers: ";
    std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
    std::cout << std::endl;

    operation(a, b, c, d);

    return 0;
}
```
