## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
    print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", calculate_factorial(num))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: Factorial of 5 is 120
```
