## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the output list should be [0, 2, 6].

## Reference Solution
```python
def multiply_by_index(lst):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with elements being the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []

    # Iterate over the input list with the index and value
    for i, val in enumerate(lst):
        # For each element, calculate the product of the element and its index
        product = val * i
        
        # Append the product to the result list
        result.append(product)

    # Return the result list
    return result

# Test the function
print(multiply_by_index([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [0, 2, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 2, 6]
```
