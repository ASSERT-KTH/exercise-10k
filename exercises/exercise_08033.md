## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to determine a student's grade based on their score.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the student's grade based on their score.
    
    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.
    
    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Example usage
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
