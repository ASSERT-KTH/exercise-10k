## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user, using conditional statements to determine the winner

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Asks the user for their choice and returns it."""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Plays the Rock, Paper, Scissors game."""
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

def main():
    play_again = "yes"
    while play_again.lower() == "yes":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: rock

It's a tie!
Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp00o6vjvf.py", line 43, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp00o6vjvf.py", line 40, in main
    play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
