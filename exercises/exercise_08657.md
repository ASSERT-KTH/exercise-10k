## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the sum of all elements in a list of lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_elements(list_of_lists):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a list of lists.

    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list containing lists of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all elements in the list of lists.
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0. This variable will store the sum of all elements in the list of lists.
    total_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists.
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # For each sublist, iterate over each element in the sublist.
        for element in sublist:
            # Add the current element to the total sum.
            total_sum += element

    # Return the total sum after iterating over all elements in the list of lists.
    return total_sum


# Example usage:
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(sum_of_elements(list_of_lists))  # Output: 45
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
