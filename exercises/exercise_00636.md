## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the discount amount and the final price of a product given the original price and discount percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate discount and final price
def calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):
    # Calculate discount amount
    discount_amount = (original_price * discount_percentage) / 100
    
    # Calculate final price
    final_price = original_price - discount_amount
    
    return discount_amount, final_price

# Main function
def main():
    # Input original price and discount percentage
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the product: "))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

    # Calculate discount and final price
    discount_amount, final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)

    # Print the results
    print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%")
    print(f"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the original price of the product: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_ir5zqej.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_ir5zqej.py", line 14, in main
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the product: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 10'
```
