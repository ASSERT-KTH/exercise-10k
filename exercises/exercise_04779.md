## Exercise
Write a program that calculates a student's GPA based on their grades. If the grade is 'A', the GPA is 4.0. If the grade is 'B', the GPA is 3.0. If the grade is 'C', the GPA is 2.0. If the grade is 'D', the GPA is 1.0. If the grade is 'F', the GPA is 0.0.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gpa(grades):
    """
    Calculate the GPA based on the given grades.

    Args:
        grades (list): A list of grades, where each grade is a string ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F').

    Returns:
        float: The calculated GPA.
    """
    # Define the GPA for each grade
    gpa_map = {
        'A': 4.0,
        'B': 3.0,
        'C': 2.0,
        'D': 1.0,
        'F': 0.0
    }

    # Initialize the total GPA and the count of grades
    total_gpa = 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate over each grade
    for grade in grades:
        # Check if the grade is valid
        if grade.upper() in gpa_map:
            # Add the GPA for the current grade to the total GPA
            total_gpa += gpa_map[grade.upper()]
            # Increment the count of grades
            count += 1
        else:
            print(f"Invalid grade: {grade}. Skipping...")

    # Check if there are any grades
    if count == 0:
        return 0

    # Calculate the average GPA
    average_gpa = total_gpa / count

    return average_gpa


def main():
    # Example usage
    grades = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F']
    gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)
    print(f"GPA: {gpa:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
GPA: 2.00
```
