## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Description: This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

# Put the value of n in a
a = 10  # change this value to test the program with different inputs

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to a (inclusive)
for i in range(1, a + 1):
    # Add the current number to the sum
    sum += i

# Print the result
print("The sum of all numbers from 1 to", a, "is:", sum)
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```
