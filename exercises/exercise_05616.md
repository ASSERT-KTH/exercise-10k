## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random password based on user input (e.g. length, character types), taking the user's input as parameters.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars):
    """
    Generate a random password based on user input.

    Args:
        length (int): The length of the password.
        use_uppercase (bool): Whether to include uppercase letters.
        use_numbers (bool): Whether to include numbers.
        use_special_chars (bool): Whether to include special characters.

    Returns:
        str: A random password based on user input.
    """

    # Define the characters that can be included in the password
    chars = string.ascii_lowercase
    if use_uppercase:
        chars += string.ascii_uppercase
    if use_numbers:
        chars += string.digits
    if use_special_chars:
        chars += string.punctuation

    # Ensure the password includes at least one of each required character type
    password = []
    if use_uppercase:
        password.append(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase))
    if use_numbers:
        password.append(random.choice(string.digits))
    if use_special_chars:
        password.append(random.choice(string.punctuation))
    password.append(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase))

    # Fill the rest of the password with random characters
    for _ in range(length - len(password)):
        password.append(random.choice(chars))

    # Shuffle the password to avoid the first characters always being in the same character type order
    random.shuffle(password)

    return ''.join(password)


def main():
    print("Password Generator")
    print("------------------")

    length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))
    use_uppercase = input("Include uppercase letters? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"
    use_numbers = input("Include numbers? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"
    use_special_chars = input("Include special characters? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

    if length < 1:
        print("Length must be at least 1.")
    elif (use_uppercase or use_numbers or use_special_chars) and length < 2:
        print("Length must be at least 2 if including uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.")
    elif (use_uppercase and use_numbers and use_special_chars) and length < 4:
        print("Length must be at least 4 if including uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.")
    else:
        password = generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars)
        print("Generated Password : ", password)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Password Generator
------------------
Enter the length of the password: Include uppercase letters? (yes/no): Include numbers? (yes/no): Include special characters? (yes/no):
