## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_even_sum():
    """
    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20.
    """
    even_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 21):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += i
    return even_sum

def main():
    even_sum = calculate_even_sum()
    print(f"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: {even_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: 110
```
