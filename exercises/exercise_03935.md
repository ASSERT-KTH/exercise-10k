## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the standard deviation of the numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the numbers.
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the variance of the numbers
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers
    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    return standard_deviation

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
print(f"The standard deviation of the numbers is: {standard_deviation}")
```

```python
import statistics

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the numbers.
    """
    return statistics.stdev(numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
print(f"The standard deviation of the numbers is: {standard_deviation}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The standard deviation of the numbers is: 1.4142135623730951
```
