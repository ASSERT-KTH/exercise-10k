## Exercise
Write a function that removes duplicates from a given list, preserving the original order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_duplicates(input_list):
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a given list, preserving the original order.
    
    Args:
        input_list (list): The list from which to remove duplicates.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed, preserving the original order.
    """
    
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the elements we've seen so far
    seen = {}
    
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # Check if the element is already in the 'seen' dictionary
        if element not in seen:
            # If it's not, add it to the 'seen' dictionary and the result list
            seen[element] = True  # The value doesn't matter, we're just using the dictionary for its fast lookup
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

# Test the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]))
```

## Generated Output

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
