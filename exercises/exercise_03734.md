## Exercise
Create a program that takes a password as input, checks if it's valid, and prints out a success message if it is.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validate a password based on the following criteria:
    - At least 8 characters long
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one digit
    - At least one special character
    """
    # Define the regular expression pattern
    pattern = r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*#?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*#?&]{8,}$"
    
    # Check if the password matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, password):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    # Get the password from the user
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    
    # Validate the password
    if validate_password(password):
        print("Password is valid.")
    else:
        print("Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:")
        print("- At least 8 characters long")
        print("- At least one uppercase letter")
        print("- At least one lowercase letter")
        print("- At least one digit")
        print("- At least one special character")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
