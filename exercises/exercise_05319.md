## Exercise
Create a function that uses the reduce function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a list of numbers using the reduce function.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the numbers in the list.
    """
    # Use the reduce function to apply the addition operation to all items in the list
    total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print("The sum of the numbers is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the numbers is: 15
```
