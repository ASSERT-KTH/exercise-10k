## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the average temperature given a list of temperatures for each day of the week. The program should take in a list of 7 temperatures as input and output the average temperature.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_temperature(temperatures):
    """
    Calculate the average temperature given a list of temperatures for each day of the week.

    Args:
        temperatures (list): A list of 7 temperatures, one for each day of the week.

    Returns:
        float: The average temperature.
    """

    # Check if the input list has 7 temperatures
    if len(temperatures) != 7:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have 7 temperatures")

    # Check if all temperatures are numbers
    if not all(isinstance(temp, (int, float)) for temp in temperatures):
        raise ValueError("All temperatures must be numbers")

    # Calculate the sum of all temperatures
    total_temperature = sum(temperatures)

    # Calculate the average temperature by dividing the sum by the number of temperatures
    average_temperature = total_temperature / len(temperatures)

    return average_temperature


def main():
    # Example usage:
    temperatures = [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
    average_temp = calculate_average_temperature(temperatures)
    print(f"The average temperature is: {average_temp:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average temperature is: 28.00
```
