## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary of meteorological data as input, where the keys are the names of cities and the values are dictionaries with temperature and humidity data. The inner dictionaries should have 'temperature' and 'humidity' as keys. The program should calculate and return the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_hottest_and_most_humid_city(meteorological_data):
    """
    This function finds the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.

    Args:
        meteorological_data (dict): A dictionary of meteorological data where the keys are the names of cities and the values are dictionaries with 'temperature' and 'humidity' as keys.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.
    """
    if not meteorological_data:
        return None, None

    hottest_city = max(meteorological_data, key=lambda city: meteorological_data[city]['temperature'])
    most_humid_city = max(meteorological_data, key=lambda city: meteorological_data[city]['humidity'])

    return hottest_city, most_humid_city

# Example usage:
meteorological_data = {
    'New York': {'temperature': 20, 'humidity': 60},
    'Los Angeles': {'temperature': 25, 'humidity': 50},
    'Chicago': {'temperature': 18, 'humidity': 70},
    'Houston': {'temperature': 22, 'humidity': 80}
}

hottest_city, most_humid_city = find_hottest_and_most_humid_city(meteorological_data)

print(f'Hottest city: {hottest_city}')
print(f'Most humid city: {most_humid_city}')
```

## Generated Output
```
Hottest city: Los Angeles
Most humid city: Houston
```
