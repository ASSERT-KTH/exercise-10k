## Exercise
Write a function called 'is_within_range' that checks if a given number is within a specified range (inclusive).

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_within_range(num, lower, upper):
    """
    Checks if a given number is within a specified range (inclusive).

    Args:
        num (int): The number to check.
        lower (int): The lower bound of the range (inclusive).
        upper (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input number is an integer
    # This is because the problem statement doesn't specify what to do with floats
    # We'll assume that the input number should be an integer
    if not isinstance(num, int):
        raise TypeError("The input number must be an integer.")

    # Next, we need to check if the lower and upper bounds are integers
    # This is because the problem statement doesn't specify what to do with floats
    # We'll assume that the lower and upper bounds should be integers
    if not isinstance(lower, int) or not isinstance(upper, int):
        raise TypeError("The lower and upper bounds must be integers.")

    # Now, we need to check if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound
    # This is because the range is inclusive, so the lower bound should be less than or equal to the upper bound
    if lower > upper:
        raise ValueError("The lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.")

    # Finally, we can check if the number is within the range
    # We'll use the built-in comparison operators to check if the number is greater than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound
    return lower <= num <= upper
```
