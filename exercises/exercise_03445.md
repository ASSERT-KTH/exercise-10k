## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user, where the computer generates a random choice and the program determines the winner

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """
    Returns the computer's random choice.
    """
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """
    Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
    """
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper") or \
         (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        elif user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
