## Exercise
Develop a program that simulates a coin flip, where the user can choose to flip a coin and the program generates a random result (heads or tails)

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    """
    Simulate a coin flip and return the result (heads or tails).
    """
    result = random.choice(['heads', 'tails'])
    return result

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Coin Flip Simulator!")
    while True:
        user_input = input("Would you like to flip a coin? (yes/no): ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'yes':
            result = coin_flip()
            print(f"The result is: {result}")
        elif user_input.lower() == 'no':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```

Would you like to flip a coin? (yes/no): Invalid input. Please try again.
Would you like to flip a coin? (yes/no):
