## Exercise
Create a program that plays Hangman with the user. The program generates a random word, and the user has to guess the word by suggesting letters. After each guess, the program tells the user if the letter appears in the word or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# List of words to choose from
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

def hangman():
    # Choose a random word from the list
    word = random.choice(word_list)
    word_length = len(word)

    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores
    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length
    guessed_letters = []
    tries = 6

    print("Let's play Hangman!")
    print(display_hangman(tries))
    print(' '.join(guessed_word))
    print("\n")

    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:
        guess = input("Please guess a letter: ").lower()

        if len(guess) != 1:
            print("Please guess one letter at a time.")
        elif guess in guessed_letters:
            print("You already guessed this letter.")
        elif guess not in word:
            tries -= 1
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
            print(f"Incorrect! You have {tries} tries left.")
            print(display_hangman(tries))
            print(' '.join(guessed_word))
            print("\n")
        else:
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
            word_as_list = list(word)
            indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]
            for index in indices:
                guessed_word[index] = guess
            print(' '.join(guessed_word))
            print("\n")

    if '_' not in guessed_word:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the word.")
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, you ran out of tries. The word was {word}.")
