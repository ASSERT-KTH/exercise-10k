## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    """Ask the user for a number and print whether it's prime."""
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 7 is a prime number.
```
