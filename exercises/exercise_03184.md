## Exercise
Write a program that takes a year as input and uses if/else statements to determine if it's a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    """
    Determine if a year is a leap year.

    A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, 
    except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. 
    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the year is a leap year
    if year % 4 == 0:  # If the year is evenly divisible by 4
        if year % 100 == 0:  # Unless it's a century year
            if year % 400 == 0:  # Unless it's evenly divisible by 400
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False


def main():
    # Get the year from the user
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    # Check if the year is a leap year
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
