## Exercise
Declare a constant variable and understand its purpose

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a constant variable
PI = 3.14159

# Attempting to reassign a new value will result in an error
try:
    PI = 2.0
except AttributeError:
    print("Cannot reassign a constant variable")
```

```python
from typing import Final

# Declare a constant variable using the final type hint
PI: Final = 3.14159

# Attempting to reassign a new value will result in a warning
# Note: This is not enforced at runtime, but rather by linters and IDEs
PI = 2.0  # This will raise a warning, but not an error
```

## Generated Output
