## Exercise
Create a program that takes three numbers as input and prints out the maximum of the three.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max(a, b, c):
    """
    This function finds the maximum of three numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.
        c (int): The third number.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum of the three numbers.
    """
    return max(a, b, c)


def main():
    # Get the three numbers from the user
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    c = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

    # Find and print the maximum
    max_num = find_max(a, b, c)
    print("The maximum of the three numbers is:", max_num)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmplcqel831.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmplcqel831.py", line 18, in main
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1, 2, 3'
```
