## Exercise
Write a program to find the maximum flow in a flow network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, source, sink, parent):
    """
    Breadth-first search to find an augmenting path.
    
    Args:
    graph (list): Residual graph.
    source (int): Source node.
    sink (int): Sink node.
    parent (list): Parent nodes for the augmenting path.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if an augmenting path is found, False otherwise.
