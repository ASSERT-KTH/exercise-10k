## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the average of all elements in a given array of numbers. The program should take an array as input, sum all the elements, and then divide by the total number of elements to get the average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def average(arr):
    s = 0
    for i in arr:
        s += i
    return s / len(arr)

print(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

## Generated Output
