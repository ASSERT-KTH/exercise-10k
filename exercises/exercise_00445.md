## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), then performs the operation and prints out the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Get user input for two numbers
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
        return

    # Get user input for operator
    operator = input("Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")

    # Perform the operation based on the operator
    if operator == "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operator == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operator == "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operator == "/":
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
            return
    else:
        print("Invalid operator. Please enter +, -, *, or /.")
        return

    # Print the result
    print(f"The result of {num1} {operator} {num2} is {result}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: Enter the second number: Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): The result of 2.0 + 3.0 is 5.0.
```
