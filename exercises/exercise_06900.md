## Exercise
Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers. The function should also take an optional parameter that, if True, returns the sum of all the odd numbers instead.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_odd_numbers(num_list, sum_odd=False):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list.
    If the optional parameter sum_odd is True, it returns the sum of all odd numbers instead.

    Parameters:
    num_list (list): A list of integers.
    sum_odd (bool): An optional parameter to choose between summing even or odd numbers. Default is False.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of either all even or all odd numbers in the list.
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the numbers
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in num_list:
        # Check if the sum_odd parameter is False, meaning we want to sum even numbers
        if not sum_odd:
            # Check if the current number is even by using the modulus operator (%)
            # If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, the number is even
            if num % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even number to the total sum
                total_sum += num
        # If the sum_odd parameter is True, we want to sum odd numbers
        else:
            # Check if the current number is odd by using the modulus operator (%)
            # If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is not 0, the number is odd
            if num % 2 != 0:
                # Add the odd number to the total sum
                total_sum += num
    
    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list
    return total_sum
