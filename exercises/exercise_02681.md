## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints 'Positive' if the number is greater than 0, 'Negative' if the number is less than 0, and 'Zero' if the number is equal to 0.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This is a comment - anything following the "#" symbol is ignored by the interpreter.

# Ask the user for an integer input
print("Enter an integer:")
x = int(input())

if x > 0: # This is a conditional statement - it checks if the number is greater than 0
    print("Positive") # If the condition is true, it prints "Positive"
elif x < 0: # This is another conditional statement - it checks if the number is less than 0
    print("Negative") # If the condition is true, it prints "Negative"
elif x == 0: # This is another conditional statement - it checks if the number is equal to 0
    print("Zero") # If the condition is true, it prints "Zero"
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter an integer:
Positive
```
