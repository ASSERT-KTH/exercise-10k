## Exercise
Write a program that checks the weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.) and prints a corresponding message

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_weather(weather):
    """
    Checks the weather and prints a corresponding message.

    Args:
        weather (str): The current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

    Returns:
        None
    """
    weather_conditions = {
        "sunny": "It's a beautiful day! Enjoy the sunshine.",
        "rainy": "Don't forget your umbrella! It's raining outside.",
        "cloudy": "The weather is a bit gloomy today. Stay cozy.",
        "snowy": "Winter is here! Wrap up warm and enjoy the snow.",
        "windy": "Hold onto your hat! It's a windy day today.",
        "foggy": "Be careful on the roads. The fog is reducing visibility."
    }

    if weather.lower() in weather_conditions:
        print(weather_conditions[weather.lower()])
    else:
        print("Unknown weather condition. Please try again.")

def main():
    # Example usage
    weather_conditions = ["sunny", "rainy", "cloudy", "snowy", "windy", "foggy"]
    for weather in weather_conditions:
        print(f"Weather: {weather.capitalize()}")
        check_weather(weather)
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
