## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a coin flip using a while loop and asks the user if they want to flip again.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    """Simulates a coin flip and returns the result."""
    return "Heads" if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else "Tails"

def main():
    """Asks the user if they want to flip a coin and repeats until they choose to stop."""
    while True:
        print(f"You got: {coin_flip()}")
        response = input("Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): ")
        if response.lower() != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
You got: Heads
Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): You got: Heads
Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpgpdfbm09.py", line 16, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpgpdfbm09.py", line 11, in main
    response = input("Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
