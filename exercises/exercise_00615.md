## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the average of a set of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the input numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Get the number of values from the user
    num_values = int(input("Enter the number of values: "))

    # Initialize an empty list to store the numbers
    numbers = []

    # Get the numbers from the user
    for i in range(num_values):
        num = float(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
        numbers.append(num)

    # Calculate and print the average
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average is: {average:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of values: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcxtydn04.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcxtydn04.py", line 16, in main
    num_values = int(input("Enter the number of values: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 2 3 4 5'
```
