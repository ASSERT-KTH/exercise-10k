## Exercise
Create a function that implements a simple game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Hangman.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Tic Tac Toe game in Python

board = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the game board

def print_board():
    """
    Prints the current state of the game board.
    """
    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])
    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])
    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])

    print()
    print(row1)
    print(row2)
    print(row3)
    print()

def has_won(player):
    """
    Checks if the given player has won the game.

    Args:
        player (str): The player to check for (either 'X' or 'O').

    Returns:
        bool: True if the player has won, False otherwise.
    """
    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for combo in winning_combos:
        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] == player:
            return True
    return False

def is_draw():
    """
    Checks if the game is a draw (i.e., all squares are filled and no player has won).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the game is a draw, False otherwise.
    """
    return ' ' not in board and not has_won('X') and not has_won('O')

def main():
    current_player = 'X'
    while True:
        print_board()
        move = input("Player {}, enter your move (1-9): ".format(current_player))
        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':
            print("Invalid move, try again.")
            continue
        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player
        if has_won(current_player):
            print_board()
            print("Player {} wins! Congratulations!".format(current_player))
            break
        elif is_draw():
            print_board()
            print("It's a draw!")
            break
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
