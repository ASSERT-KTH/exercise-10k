    Merge two lists into a single list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to merge.
        list2 (list): The second list to merge.

    Returns:
        list: The merged list.
    """
    return list1 + list2

# Example usage:
def main():
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]
    merged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)
    print("Merged List:", merged_list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
