## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a weight and calculates the corresponding shipping cost using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight):
    """
    Calculate shipping cost based on weight.

    Args:
        weight (float): Weight of the package in pounds.

    Returns:
        float: Shipping cost.
    """
    if weight <= 2:
        return 3.00
    elif weight <= 6:
        return 5.00
    elif weight <= 10:
        return 7.00
    else:
        return 10.00 + (weight - 10) * 0.50

def main():
    # Get weight from user
    weight = float(input("Enter weight in pounds: "))

    # Calculate and display shipping cost
    shipping_cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight)
    print(f"Shipping cost: ${shipping_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter weight in pounds: Shipping cost: $7.00
```
