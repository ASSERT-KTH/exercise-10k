## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the discount for a customer based on their age. If the customer is 65 or older, they receive a 10% discount. If they are between 18 and 64 (inclusive), they receive a 5% discount. If they are under 18, they receive a 20% discount. The program should take the customer's age and the original price as input and output the price after the discount.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    int a, p;

    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
    std::cin >> a;

    std::cout << "Enter the original price: ";
    std::cin >> p;

    if (a >= 65) {
        p = std::floor(p * 0.9);
    } else if (a >= 18 && a <= 64) {
        p = std::floor(p * 0.95);
    } else {
        p = std::floor(p * 0.8);
    }

    std::cout << "The final price after discount is: " << p << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
