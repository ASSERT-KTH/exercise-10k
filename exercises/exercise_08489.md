## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The system should take the account balance and the transaction amount as inputs. If the transaction amount is greater than the account balance, the system should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the system should subtract the transaction amount from the account balance and print the new balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bank_transaction_system(account_balance, transaction_amount):
    if transaction_amount > account_balance:
        print("Insufficient funds")
    else:
        account_balance -= transaction_amount
        print("Your new balance is: ", account_balance)

# Example usage
account_balance = 1000
transaction_amount = 500
bank_transaction_system(account_balance, transaction_amount)
```

## Generated Output
```
Your new balance is:  500
```
