## Exercise
Create a program that uses Newton's method to find the square root of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def newton_sqrt(n, precision=0.00001):
    """
    Calculate the square root of a number using Newton's method.

    Args:
        n (float): The number to find the square root of.
        precision (float): The desired precision of the result. Defaults to 0.00001.

    Returns:
        float: The approximate square root of the given number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of negative number")

    # Initial guess
    x = n / 2

    while True:
        # Newton's method formula: x_new = (x + n / x) / 2
        x_new = (x + n / x) / 2

        # Check if the difference between the current and new estimates is within the desired precision
        if abs(x - x_new) < precision:
            return x_new

        # Update the estimate
        x = x_new


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 9
    sqrt = newton_sqrt(num)
    print(f"The square root of {num} is approximately {sqrt}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The square root of 9 is approximately 3.0
```
