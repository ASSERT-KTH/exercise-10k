## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are in either list but not in both.

## Reference Solution
```python
def symmetric_difference(list1, list2):
    """
    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing elements that are in either list but not in both.

    Parameters:
    list1 (list): The first input list.
    list2 (list): The second input list.

    Returns:
    list: A new list containing elements that are in either list but not in both.
    """

    # Convert the input lists to sets for efficient set operations
    set1 = set(list1)
    
    # Convert the second list to a set for the same reason
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets using the ^ operator
    # The ^ operator returns a set with elements in either the set on the left or the right, but not both
    symmetric_diff = set1 ^ set2
    
    # Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it
    # We use list() function to convert the set back to a list because the problem requires a list as output
    return list(symmetric_diff)

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
print(symmetric_difference(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 5, 6]
```
