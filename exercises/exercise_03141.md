## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    even_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 == 0)
    return even_sum

def main():
    # Example usage
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = sum_even_numbers(n)
    print(f"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
```
