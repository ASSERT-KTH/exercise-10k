Write a program to create a new list using list comprehension.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Original list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Create a new list using list comprehension
    doubled_numbers = [num * 2 for num in numbers]

    # Print the original and new lists
    print("Original list:", numbers)
    print("New list with doubled numbers:", doubled_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
