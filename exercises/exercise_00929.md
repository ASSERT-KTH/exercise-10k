## Exercise
Write a program that creates a simple chatbot using if/else statement

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to handle user input
def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to the simple chatbot!")
    print("Type 'hello' to start a conversation.")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit the conversation.")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").lower()

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_input == "quit":
            print("Bot: Goodbye!")
            break

        # Check for basic greetings
        elif user_input == "hello":
            print("Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?")
        elif user_input == "hi":
            print("Bot: Hi! What's on your mind?")
        elif user_input == "hey":
            print("Bot: Hey! How can I help you?")

        # Check for basic queries
        elif user_input == "how are you":
            print("Bot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!")
        elif user_input == "what is your name":
            print("Bot: My name is Simple Chatbot.")
        elif user_input == "what can you do":
            print("Bot: I can have basic conversations and answer simple questions.")

        # Default response for unknown queries
        else:
            print("Bot: Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?")

# Call the chatbot function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```

## Generated Output
