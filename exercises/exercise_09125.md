## Exercise
Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the specified operation on the numbers and prints the result. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    Performs the specified arithmetic operation on two numbers.

    Args:
    num1 (float): The first number.
    num2 (float): The second number.
    operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.

    Returns:
    float: The result of the arithmetic operation.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions
    operations = {
        'addition': lambda x, y: x + y,
        'subtraction': lambda x, y: x - y,
        'multiplication': lambda x, y: x * y,
        'division': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')
    }

    # Check if the operation is supported
    if operation not in operations:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation. Supported operations are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division")

    # Perform the operation and return the result
    return operations[operation](num1, num2)


def main():
    # Get the numbers and operation from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    print("Available operations:")
    print("1. Addition")
    print("2. Subtraction")
    print("3. Multiplication")
    print("4. Division")

    choice = int(input("Enter the number of your chosen operation: "))

    operations = {
        1: 'addition',
        2: 'subtraction',
        3: 'multiplication',
        4: 'division'
    }

    if choice not in operations:
        print("Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.")
        return

    operation = operations[choice]

    # Perform the operation and print the result
    try:
        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)
        print(f"The result of {operation} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpz4_hall6.py", line 32, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 + 3'
