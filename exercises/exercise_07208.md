## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the average grade of a student using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade():
    # Get the number of grades from the user
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))

    # Initialize the sum of grades to 0
    total_grades = 0

    # Loop through each grade
    for i in range(num_grades):
        # Get the grade from the user
        grade = float(input(f"Enter grade {i+1}: "))

        # Add the grade to the total
        total_grades += grade

    # Calculate the average grade
    average_grade = total_grades / num_grades

    # Display the average grade
    print(f"The average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}")

# Call the function
calculate_average_grade()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of grades: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpjfwrifrm.py", line 23, in <module>
    calculate_average_grade()
  File "/tmp/tmpjfwrifrm.py", line 3, in calculate_average_grade
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[90, 80, 70, 60]'
```
