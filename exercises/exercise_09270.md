## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should use a basic algorithm to reverse the string, such as iterating over the input string from the end to the start.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed = ''
    length = len(s)
    for index in range(length):
        reversed += s[length - 1 - index]
    return reversed

s = "Hello World"
print(reverse_string(s))
```
