## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for the current temperature and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the temperature is above 25, print 'It's hot outside'; if the temperature is between 15 and 25, print 'It's mild outside'; if the temperature is below 15, print 'It's cold outside'

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_temperature_message():
    """
    Asks the user for the current temperature and prints a message based on the temperature.
    """
    # Ask the user for the current temperature
    temperature = float(input("Please enter the current temperature: "))

    # Determine the message based on the temperature
    if temperature > 25:
        message = "It's hot outside"
    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:
        message = "It's mild outside"
    else:
        message = "It's cold outside"

    # Print the message
    print(message)


def main():
    # Call the function to get the temperature message
    get_temperature_message()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the current temperature: It's mild outside
```
