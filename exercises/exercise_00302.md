## Exercise
Write a function that returns the element at a specified index in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_element_at_index(lst, index):
    """
    Returns the element at a specified index in a given list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        index (int): The index of the element to be retrieved.

    Returns:
        any: The element at the specified index if it exists, otherwise None.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list
    # This is because list indices in Python start at 0 and go up to len(list) - 1
    if index < 0 or index >= len(lst):
        
        # If the index is out of bounds, we return None
        # This could also be handled by raising an exception, depending on the requirements
        return None
    
    # If the index is within bounds, we can simply return the element at that index
    # We use the built-in list indexing syntax for this
    return lst[index]
```
