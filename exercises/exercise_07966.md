## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate the basics of network programming using sockets.

## Reference Solution
```python
import socket

def start_server():
    # Create a socket object
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server's IP address and port
    host = '127.0.0.1'
    port = 12345

    # Bind the socket to the host and port
    server_socket.bind((host, port))

    # Listen for incoming connections
    server_socket.listen(5)
    print(f"Server listening on {host}:{port}")

    while True:
        # Accept an incoming connection
        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {address} established")

        # Receive data from the client
        data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
        print(f"Received message from client: {data}")

        # Send a response back to the client
        response = "Hello from server!"
        client_socket.send(response.encode())

        # Close the client socket
        client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()
```

```python
import socket

def start_client():
    # Create a socket object
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server's IP address and port
    host = '127.0.0.1'
    port = 12345

    # Connect to the server
    client_socket.connect((host, port))
    print(f"Connected to server {host}:{port}")

    # Send a message to the server
    message = "Hello from client!"
    client_socket.send(message.encode())

    # Receive a response from the server
    response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Received response from server: {response}")

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_client()
```
