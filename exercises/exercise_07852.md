## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score using if/else statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Main function
def main():
    # Get the student's score from the user
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score (out of 100): "))

    # Validate the score
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        # Calculate the grade
        grade = calculate_grade(score)

        # Print the grade
        print(f"The student's grade is {grade}.")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (out of 100): The student's grade is B.
