## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is a negative number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Test the function
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
try:
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: Factorial of 5 is 120
```
