## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_char(string, char):
    """
    This function takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
    
    Parameters:
    string (str): The input string.
    char (str): The character to be searched in the string.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of times the character appears in the string.
    """
    return string.count(char)

def main():
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
    if len(char) != 1:
        print("Please enter a single character.")
    else:
        print(f"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Enter a character: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpde0czso6.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpde0czso6.py", line 16, in main
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
