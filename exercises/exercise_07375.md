## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements, and then doubles the value of each element. The program should output the modified list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_and_double(lst):
    lst.reverse()
    return [x * 2 for x in lst]

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(reverse_and_double(lst))
```

## Generated Output
```
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```
