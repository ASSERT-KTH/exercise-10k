## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary where the keys and values are inverted. If the input dictionary has non-unique values, the resulting dictionary should have the last key-value pair from the input dictionary. Handle potential errors for non-dict inputs and non-hashable types as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def invert_dict(input_dict):
    """
    Inverts a dictionary, making the values keys and the keys values.
    If the input dictionary has non-unique values, the resulting dictionary will have the last key-value pair from the input dictionary.
    Handles potential errors for non-dict inputs and non-hashable types as values.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be inverted.

    Returns:
        dict: The inverted dictionary.
    """

    # Check if the input is a dictionary, raise a TypeError if it's not
    if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a dictionary")

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inverted key-value pairs
    inverted_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # Try to add the value as a key and the key as a value in the inverted dictionary
        try:
            # If the value is not hashable, this will raise a TypeError
            inverted_dict[value] = key
        except TypeError:
            # If the value is not hashable, raise a ValueError with a descriptive message
            raise ValueError(f"Value '{value}' is not hashable and cannot be used as a key")

    # Return the inverted dictionary
    return inverted_dict
```
