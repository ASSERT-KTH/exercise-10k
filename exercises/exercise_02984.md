## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the given list of numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average of {numbers} is {average}")
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate an empty list
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
