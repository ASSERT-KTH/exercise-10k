## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and breadth.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_rectangle_properties(length, breadth):
    """
    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        breadth (float): The breadth of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
    """
    area = length * breadth
    perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
    return area, perimeter

def main():
    # Get the length and breadth from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    breadth = float(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))

    # Calculate the area and perimeter
    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, breadth)

    # Print the results
    print(f"Area: {area} square units")
    print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter} units")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpadv78c8y.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpadv78c8y.py", line 18, in main
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'length = 5, breadth = 3'
```
