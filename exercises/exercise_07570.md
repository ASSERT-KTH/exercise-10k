## Exercise
Write a function that uses assertions to verify the correctness of its input or internal state.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a list. If it's not, we raise an AssertionError.
    assert isinstance(numbers, list), "Input must be a list"

    # Then, we check if the list is not empty. If it is, we raise an AssertionError.
    assert len(numbers) > 0, "List cannot be empty"

    # Next, we check if all elements in the list are numbers. If any element is not a number, we raise an AssertionError.
    assert all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers), "All elements in the list must be numbers"

    # Now that we've verified the correctness of our input, we can calculate the average.
    # We use the sum function to add up all the numbers in the list, and then divide by the length of the list.
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Finally, we return the calculated average.
    return average

# Test the function
print(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
```

## Generated Output
```
3.0
```
