## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a bank account manager. The program should allow the user to deposit, withdraw, or check their balance, and print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposit a specified amount into the account."""
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Withdraw a specified amount from the account."""
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        elif amount <= 0:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")

    def check_balance(self):
        """Print the current account balance."""
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Manager")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: $"))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: $"))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Bank Account Manager
1. Deposit

3. Check Balance
4. Exit
