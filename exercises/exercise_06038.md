## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of the even numbers. If the list contains an odd number greater than 10, raise a ValueError.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a given list.
    If the list contains an odd number greater than 10, it raises a ValueError.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of even numbers in the list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list contains an odd number greater than 10.
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0
    total_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd and greater than 10
        if num % 2 != 0 and num > 10:
            # If the condition is met, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("The list contains an odd number greater than 10")

        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is even, calculate its square and add it to the total sum
            total_sum += num ** 2

    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list
    return total_sum
```
