## Exercise
Write a program that takes the principal, rate, and time as input and prints the simple interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the simple interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money.
        rate (float): The interest rate (in percent).
        time (float): The time period (in years).

    Returns:
        float: The simple interest.
    """
    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    return simple_interest

def main():
    # Get user input
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in percent): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate and print the simple interest
    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)
    print(f"The simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp31e9aac3.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp31e9aac3.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
