## Exercise
Create a program that reads a string from the user and prints it out character by character with a delay between each character.

## Reference Solution
```python
import time

def print_string_with_delay(input_string, delay=0.1):
    """
    Prints the input string character by character with a specified delay.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The string to be printed.
        delay (float, optional): The delay between each character in seconds. Defaults to 0.1.
    """

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Print the character
        print(char, end='', flush=True)
        
        # Wait for the specified delay
        time.sleep(delay)

def main():
    # Get the input string from the user
    input_string = input("Please enter a string: ")

    # Print the string with a delay
    print_string_with_delay(input_string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
