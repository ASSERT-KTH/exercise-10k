## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
import itertools

def combine_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Returns a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first input array.
        arr2 (list): The second input array.

    Returns:
        list: A new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.
    """
    return list(itertools.product(arr1, arr2))

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']

result = combine_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
[(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'c'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```
