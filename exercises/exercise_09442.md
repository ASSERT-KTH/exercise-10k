## Exercise
Create a program that takes a score as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """Calculate the grade based on the score."""
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    """Get the score from the user and print the corresponding grade."""
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                grade = calculate_grade(score)
                print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score (0-100): Your grade is: B
```
