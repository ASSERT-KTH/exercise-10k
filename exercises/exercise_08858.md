## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the sum of cubed numbers of a list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_cubes(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubed numbers in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of cubed numbers in the list.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.
    """
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):
        raise TypeError("List must contain only numeric values")

    return sum(num ** 3 for num in numbers)


# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_cubes(numbers)
print(f"The sum of cubed numbers is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of cubed numbers is: 225
```
