## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for a password and checks if it meets the following conditions: at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, contains at least one lowercase letter, contains at least one digit. Print out a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validate a password based on the given conditions.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one digit
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        return False

    return True


def main():
    # Ask the user for a password
    password = input("Please enter a password: ")

    # Validate the password
    if validate_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following conditions:")
        print("* At least 8 characters long")
        print("* Contains at least one uppercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one lowercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one digit")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
