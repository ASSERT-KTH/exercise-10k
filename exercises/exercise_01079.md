## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to print the Fizz Buzz sequence up to a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """
    Prints the Fizz Buzz sequence up to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The number up to which the sequence should be printed.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("Fizz Buzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)


def main():
    # Ask the user for the number up to which the sequence should be printed
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Print the Fizz Buzz sequence
    fizz_buzz(n)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
