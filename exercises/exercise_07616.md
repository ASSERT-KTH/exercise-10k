## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
    list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Create a list to store the Fibonacci numbers
    fibonacci_sequence = [a, b]
    
    # Generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers
    for _ in range(2, n):
        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two
        next_number = a + b
        
        # Update the previous two numbers for the next iteration
        a, b = b, next_number
        
        # Append the new Fibonacci number to the list
        fibonacci_sequence.append(next_number)
    
    return fibonacci_sequence

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 10
    print(f"The first {n} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:")
    print(generate_fibonacci(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
