## Exercise
Create a program that manages a bank account. The program allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. The program uses if-else statements to check for valid transactions.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive number.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")
        elif amount <= 0:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive number.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
