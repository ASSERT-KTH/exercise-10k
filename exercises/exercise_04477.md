## Exercise
Write a program to find the maximum element in a list that meets a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_element(lst, condition):
    """
    Find the maximum element in a list that meets a specific condition.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list of numbers.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if the condition is met, False otherwise.

    Returns:
        The maximum element in the list that meets the condition, or None if no such element exists.
    """
    max_element = None
    for element in lst:
        if condition(element):
            if max_element is None or element > max_element:
                max_element = element
    return max_element

# Define the condition function
def greater_than_3(num):
    return num > 3

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9]
max_num = find_max_element(numbers, greater_than_3)

if max_num is not None:
    print(f"The maximum element greater than 3 is: {max_num}")
else:
    print("No element greater than 3 found in the list.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The maximum element greater than 3 is: 9
```
