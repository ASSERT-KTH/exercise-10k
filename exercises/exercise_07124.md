## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers given as input. The program should take a list of numbers as input, add them up, and then divide by the total count of numbers to find the average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    num = int(input("Enter the number of values: "))
    sum = 0
    for i in range(num):
        val = float(input("Enter value #{}: ".format(i+1)))
        sum += val
    avg = sum / num
    print("The average is:", avg)

main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of values: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpw3y365dl.py", line 10, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpw3y365dl.py", line 2, in main
    num = int(input("Enter the number of values: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 20 30 40 50'
```
