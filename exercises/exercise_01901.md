## Exercise
Write a program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers input by the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def perform_arithmetic_operations():
    # Get the first number from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

    # Get the second number from the user
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Perform addition
    addition = num1 + num2

    # Perform subtraction
    subtraction = num1 - num2

    # Perform multiplication
    multiplication = num1 * num2

    # Perform division (with error handling)
    if num2 != 0:
        division = num1 / num2
    else:
        division = "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"

    # Print the results
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}")
    print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}")

# Call the function
perform_arithmetic_operations()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd5j067z1.py", line 31, in <module>
    perform_arithmetic_operations()
  File "/tmp/tmpd5j067z1.py", line 4, in perform_arithmetic_operations
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5'
```
