## Exercise
Write a program to take user input and respond with a pre-defined response based on the input

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary to map user inputs to responses
responses = {
    "hello": "Hello! How are you today?",
    "goodbye": "Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.",
    "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
    "what's your name": "My name is ChatBot.",
    "default": "I didn't understand that. Please try again."
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """
    Returns a pre-defined response based on the user input.
    
    Args:
        user_input (str): The user's input.
    
    Returns:
        str: The corresponding response.
    """
    # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    user_input = user_input.lower()
    
    # Check if the user input matches a key in the responses dictionary
    for key in responses:
        if key in user_input:
            return responses[key]
    
    # If no match is found, return the default response
    return responses["default"]

def main():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == "quit":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        
        response = get_response(user_input)
        print("ChatBot:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
You: ChatBot: Hello! How are you today?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9zmf75iq.py", line 45, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9zmf75iq.py", line 35, in main
    user_input = input("You: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
