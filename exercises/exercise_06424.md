## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers and sum them up.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the average
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate over the numbers using a for loop
    for num in numbers:
        # Add each number to the total
        total += num
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements
    average = total / len(numbers)
    
    # Return the average
    return average

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", average)
```

```python
if len(numbers) == 0:
    return None  # or some other value to indicate an error
```

## Generated Output
```
The average is: 3.0
```
