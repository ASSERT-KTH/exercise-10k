## Exercise
Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
