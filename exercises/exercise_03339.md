## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy a given condition, using a lambda function.

## Reference Solution
```python
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]))
print(even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
```
