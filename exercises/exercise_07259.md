## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a student's grade is passing or failing based on their score. If the score is 50 or above, the grade is passing; otherwise, it's failing.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int score;
    string name;
    cout << "Enter score: ";
    cin >> score;
    cout << "Enter name: ";
    cin >> name;

    if (score >= 50) {
        cout << name << " is passing." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << name << " is failing." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
