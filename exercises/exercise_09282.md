## Exercise
Create a program that takes three numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. The program should then output the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y, z;
    int resultAdd, resultSub, resultMult, resultDiv;

    cout << "Enter three numbers (x, y, z): ";
    cin >> x >> y >> z;

    resultAdd = x + y + z;
    resultSub = x - y - z;
    resultMult = x * y * z;
    resultDiv = x / y / z;

    cout << "Addition: " << resultAdd << endl;
    cout << "Subtraction: " << resultSub << endl;
    cout << "Multiplication: " << resultMult << endl;
    cout << "Division: " << resultDiv << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
