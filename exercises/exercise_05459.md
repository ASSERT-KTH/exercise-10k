## Exercise
Write a program that takes a story with missing words as input and fills them in with user input

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input(prompt):
    """Gets user input for a specific prompt."""
    return input(prompt)

def fill_in_the_blanks(story):
    """Fills in the blanks in a story with user input."""
    print("Please provide the following words:")
    words = {
        "noun": get_user_input("Enter a noun: "),
        "adjective": get_user_input("Enter an adjective: "),
        "verb": get_user_input("Enter a verb: "),
        "place": get_user_input("Enter a place: "),
        "person": get_user_input("Enter a person's name: ")
    }
    return story.format(**words)

def main():
    story = """
    Yesterday, I saw a very {adjective} {noun} walking down the street.
    I was walking to the {place} when I saw it {verb} towards me.
    I was with my friend {person} and we were both very surprised.
    """
    print("Original Story:")
    print(story)
    filled_in_story = fill_in_the_blanks(story)
    print("\nFilled-in Story:")
    print(filled_in_story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
