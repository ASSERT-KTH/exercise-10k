## Exercise
Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a list of factorials from 1 to the given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_factorials(n):
    """
    Calculate and return a list of factorials from 1 to the given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for calculating factorials.

    Returns:
        list: A list of factorials from 1 to the given number.
    """
    factorials = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the factorial using the math library
        factorial = math.factorial(i)
        factorials.append(factorial)
    return factorials

# Example usage:
def main():
    num = 5
    result = calculate_factorials(num)
    print(f"Factorials from 1 to {num}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Factorials from 1 to 5: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
```
