## Exercise
Create a program that processes a dictionary containing student information. The dictionary should have student names as keys and another dictionary as values. The inner dictionary should contain the keys 'grades' and 'attendance'. The program should calculate the average grade for each student, and then print out the student's name, average grade, and attendance. If a student has an average grade above 90, mark them as 'Excellent', between 80 and 90 as 'Good', between 70 and 80 as 'Fair', and below 70 as 'Needs Improvement'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def process_student_info(student_info):
    """
    Process a dictionary containing student information.

    Args:
        student_info (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and another dictionary as values.
            The inner dictionary should contain the keys 'grades' and 'attendance'.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    for student, info in student_info.items():
        # Calculate the average grade
        average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])

        # Determine the grade status
        if average_grade >= 90:
            grade_status = 'Excellent'
        elif average_grade >= 80:
            grade_status = 'Good'
        elif average_grade >= 70:
            grade_status = 'Fair'
        else:
            grade_status = 'Needs Improvement'

        # Print out the student's information
        print(f"Student Name: {student}")
        print(f"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}")
        print(f"Attendance: {info['attendance']}%")
        print(f"Grade Status: {grade_status}")
        print("------------------------")


# Example usage:
student_info = {
    "John Doe": {
        "grades": [85, 90, 78, 92, 88],
        "attendance": 95
    },
    "Jane Doe": {
        "grades": [70, 75, 80, 85, 90],
        "attendance": 90
    },
    "Bob Smith": {
        "grades": [60, 65, 70, 75, 80],
        "attendance": 85
    }
}

process_student_info(student_info)
```

## Generated Output
```
Student Name: John Doe
Average Grade: 86.60
Attendance: 95%
Grade Status: Good
------------------------
Student Name: Jane Doe
Average Grade: 80.00
Attendance: 90%
Grade Status: Good
------------------------
Student Name: Bob Smith
Average Grade: 70.00
Attendance: 85%
Grade Status: Fair
