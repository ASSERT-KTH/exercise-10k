## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        # Generate computer choice
        choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        # Print choices
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")

        # Determine winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif user_choice == "rock":
            if computer_choice == "scissors":
                print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
            else:
                print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
        elif user_choice == "paper":
            if computer_choice == "rock":
                print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
            else:
                print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
        elif user_choice == "scissors":
            if computer_choice == "paper":
                print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
            else:
                print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")

        # Play again
        play_again = input("\nPlay again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        while play_again not in ["yes", "no"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: paper

Paper covers rock! You lose.

Play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmphk583gte.py", line 46, in <module>
    play_game()
  File "/tmp/tmphk583gte.py", line 39, in play_game
    play_again = input("\nPlay again? (yes/no): ").lower()
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
