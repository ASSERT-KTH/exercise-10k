## Exercise
Create a function that takes in two numbers and an operator, and returns the result of the operation. The operator can be +, -, *, or /.

## Reference Solution
```python
def math_operation(num1, num2, operator):
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operator (str): The operator to use. Can be +, -, *, or /.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operator is not one of +, -, *, or /.
        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is / and num2 is 0.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding functions
    operations = {
        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,
        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,
        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,
        '/': lambda x, y: x / y
    }

    # Check if the operator is valid
    if operator not in operations:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operator. Must be +, -, *, or /.")

    # Check for division by zero
    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")

    # Perform the operation and return the result
    return operations[operator](num1, num2)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20
    print(math_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0
```

## Generated Output
```
12
8
20
5.0
```
