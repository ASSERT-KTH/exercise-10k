## Exercise
Write a function to find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window_substring(s, t):
    """
    Find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search in.
    t (str): The string containing the characters to search for.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring that contains all characters of t. If no such substring exists, returns an empty string.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in t
    t_count = Counter(t)
    required_chars = len(t_count)

    # Initialize variables to track the minimum window substring
    left = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    min_window = ""

    # Initialize variables to track the current window substring
    formed_chars = 0
    window_counts = {}

    # Iterate over the string s
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add the current character to the window counts
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        # If the added character is in t and its frequency in the window is equal to its frequency in t,
        # increment the formed_chars count
        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed_chars += 1

        # While the window contains all characters of t and the left pointer is not at the beginning of the window,
        # try to shrink the window from the left
        while left <= right and formed_chars == required_chars:
            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                min_length = right - left + 1
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]

            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counts
            character = s[left]
            window_counts[character] -= 1

            # If the removed character is in t and its frequency in the window is less than its frequency in t,
            # decrement the formed_chars count
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed_chars -= 1

            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1

    # Return the minimum window substring
    return min_window

# Example usage:
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window_substring(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
