## Exercise
Write a program to generate a pattern of numbers using a for loop. The pattern should start with 1 and each subsequent number should be one more than the previous number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_pattern(n):
    """
    Generates a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the pattern.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers in the pattern.
    """
    pattern = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        pattern.append(i)
    return pattern

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms in the pattern: "))
    pattern = generate_pattern(n)
    print("Pattern:")
    for num in pattern:
        print(num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms in the pattern: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_pmrcfov.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_pmrcfov.py", line 17, in main
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms in the pattern: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'None'
```
