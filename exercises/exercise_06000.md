## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a value as input, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in the list if it exists

## Reference Solution
```python
def last_occurrence_index(lst, value):
    """
    Returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in the list if it exists.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        value: The value to search for.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the last occurrence of the value, or -1 if not found.
    """
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):
        if lst[i] == value:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
    value = 2
    index = last_occurrence_index(lst, value)
    if index != -1:
        print(f"The last occurrence of {value} is at index {index}.")
    else:
        print(f"{value} not found in the list.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The last occurrence of 2 is at index 3.
```
