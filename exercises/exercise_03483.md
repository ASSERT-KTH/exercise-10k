## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 - num2

# Get the two numbers from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate and print the difference
difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)
print("The difference between {:.2f} and {:.2f} is {:.2f}".format(num1, num2, difference))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpv9vidr2n.py", line 15, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 4'
```
