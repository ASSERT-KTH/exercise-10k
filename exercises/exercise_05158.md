## Exercise
Find the average age of students in a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_age(students):
    """
    Calculate the average age of students in a dictionary.

    Args:
        students (dict): Dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.

    Returns:
        float: The average age of the students.
    """
    # Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not students:
        return 0

    # Calculate the sum of ages
    total_age = sum(students.values())

    # Calculate the average age
    average_age = total_age / len(students)

    return average_age


# Example usage
students = {
    "John": 20,
    "Alice": 22,
    "Bob": 21,
    "Charlie": 19
}

average_age = calculate_average_age(students)
print(f"The average age of the students is: {average_age:.2f}")
```
