## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to sum all the numbers from 1 to 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_numbers(n):
    """
    Sums all the numbers from 1 to n using a while loop.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    total = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        total += i
        i += 1
    return total

def main():
    n = 10
    result = sum_numbers(n)
    print(f"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```
