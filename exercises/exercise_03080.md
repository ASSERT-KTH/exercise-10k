## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the surface area of a rectangular prism given its length, width, and height.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_surface_area(length, width, height):
    """
    Calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangular prism.
        width (float): The width of the rectangular prism.
        height (float): The height of the rectangular prism.

    Returns:
        float: The surface area of the rectangular prism.
    """
    # Calculate the surface area
    surface_area = 2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height)

    return surface_area

def main():
    # Get the dimensions from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height: "))

    # Calculate the surface area
    surface_area = calculate_surface_area(length, width, height)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The surface area of the rectangular prism is: {surface_area:.2f} square units")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9f9b9unh.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9f9b9unh.py", line 20, in main
    length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5, 3, 2'
