## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to give the user 5 chances to guess a randomly generated number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 5
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    print("You have 5 attempts to guess it.")
    
    for attempt in range(attempts):
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} of {attempts}: ")
        
        # Check if the user's guess is a valid integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempt + 1} attempts.")
            return
        
        # Provide feedback to the user
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
    
    # If the user has used up all their attempts, reveal the number
    print(f"Sorry, you didn't guess the number. The number was {number_to_guess}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 5 attempts to guess it.
Attempt 1 of 5: Too low! Try again.
Attempt 2 of 5:
