## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, output 'Invalid score'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_to_letter(score):
    if 90 <= score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    elif 80 <= score <= 89:
        return 'B'
    elif 70 <= score <= 79:
        return 'C'
    elif 60 <= score <= 69:
        return 'D'
    elif 0 <= score <= 59:
        return 'F'
    else:
        return 'Invalid score'

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
letter = convert_to_letter(score)
print("Your grade is: ", letter)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is:  B
```
