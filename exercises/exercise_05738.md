## Exercise
Create a function that uses lambda functions to sort a list of tuples based on the second element.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_tuples(tuples_list):
    """
    This function sorts a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.
    
    Args:
        tuples_list (list): A list of tuples.
    
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of tuples.
    """
    
    # First, we check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(tuples_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    
    # Then, we check if all elements in the list are tuples
    if not all(isinstance(t, tuple) for t in tuples_list):
        raise TypeError("All elements in the list must be tuples")
    
    # We use the built-in sorted function in Python, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.
    # We pass a lambda function as the key argument to specify that we want to sort based on the second element of each tuple.
    # The lambda function takes a tuple and returns its second element (index 1).
    sorted_list = sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Finally, we return the sorted list
    return sorted_list

# Example usage:
tuples_list = [(3, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4)]
print(sort_tuples(tuples_list))  # Output: [(2, 4), (3, 6), (1, 9)]
```

## Generated Output
```
[(2, 4), (3, 6), (1, 9)]
```
