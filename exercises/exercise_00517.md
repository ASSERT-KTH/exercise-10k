## Exercise
Write a program to partition a given list into two separate lists based on a specific condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Partition a list into two separate lists based on a specific condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list to be partitioned.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists: one with elements that satisfy the condition and another with elements that don't.
    """
    list1 = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]
    list2 = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]
    return list1, list2

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    condition = lambda x: x % 2 == 0  # Condition: even numbers

    even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, condition)

    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
    print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
