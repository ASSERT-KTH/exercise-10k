## Exercise
Create a program that classifies a student's grade based on their score. The program should take an integer score between 0 and 100 as input and output the corresponding grade. The grading scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60). Use conditional statements to implement this logic.

## Reference Solution
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def grade(score):
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
        return 'D'
    elif score >= 0 and score <= 59:
        return 'F'

def main():
    score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
    grade_letter = grade(score)
    print(f"Your grade is: {grade_letter}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score (0-100): Your grade is: B
```
