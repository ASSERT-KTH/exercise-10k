## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop or a while loop, where n is the input to the program.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  int sum = 0;

  std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i * i;
  }

  std::cout << "The sum of squares of numbers from 1 to " << n << " is " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
