## Exercise
Write a function to find the longest common subsequence of two input strings. The longest common subsequence is a subsequence that appears in the same order in both strings, but it may not be contiguous.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
    """
    Find the longest common subsequence of two input strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first input string.
        str2 (str): The second input string.

    Returns:
        str: The longest common subsequence of str1 and str2.
    """
    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
    dp = [[0] * (len(str2) + 1) for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]

    # Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array
    lcs = []
    i, j = len(str1), len(str2)
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    # Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order
    return "".join(reversed(lcs))

# Example usage:
str1 = "AGGTAB"
str2 = "GXTXAYB"
print(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "GTAB"
```

## Generated Output
```
GTAB
```
