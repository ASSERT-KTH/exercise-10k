    Returns:
        str: The most frequent character in the string.
    """
    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_counts = Counter(s)
    
    # Return the most frequent character
    return char_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

# Example usage
