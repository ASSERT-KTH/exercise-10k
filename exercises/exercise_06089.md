## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to keep playing a game of rock, paper, scissors until the user decides to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'Tie'
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'User'
    return 'Computer'

def main():
    play_again = 'y'
    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
        
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
        
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'Tie':
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        else:
            print(f"{winner} wins!")
        
        play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")
        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter y or n: ").lower()

    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
Computer chose: paper
Computer wins!

Play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp78hw0n_6.py", line 41, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp78hw0n_6.py", line 34, in main
    play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
