## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula. The formula should be: sequence[n] = 2 * sequence[n-1] + 1, where sequence[0] = 1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(n):
    """
    Generate a sequence of numbers based on the formula: sequence[n] = 2 * sequence[n-1] + 1,
    where sequence[0] = 1.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.
    """
    sequence = [1]  # Initialize the sequence with the first term

    # Generate the rest of the sequence
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_term = 2 * sequence[i - 1] + 1
        sequence.append(next_term)

    return sequence


def main():
    # Example usage:
    n = 10  # Number of terms in the sequence
    sequence = generate_sequence(n)
    print("Sequence:", sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Sequence: [1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023]
```
