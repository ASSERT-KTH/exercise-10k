## Exercise
Write a program to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            next_term = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_term)
        return fib_sequence

# Example usage
num_terms = 10
fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(num_terms)
print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:")
print(fib_sequence)
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
