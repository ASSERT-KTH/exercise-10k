## Exercise
Create a function that uses the map, filter, and reduce functions to process a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def process_numbers(numbers):
    """
    This function processes a list of numbers by squaring even numbers, 
    filtering out odd numbers, and then summing up the remaining numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the squares of even numbers in the list.
    """

    # Use map to square each number in the list
    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

    # Use filter to keep only even numbers
    even_squares = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, squared_numbers))

    # Use reduce to sum up the remaining numbers
    sum_of_even_squares = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, even_squares, 0)

    return sum_of_even_squares


# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = process_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of squares of even numbers:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squares of even numbers: 56
```
