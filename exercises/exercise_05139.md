## Exercise
Write a program to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within a given array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):
    """
    Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not arr:
        return 0

    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position.
    lengths = [1] * len(arr)

    # Iterate over the array to fill the lengths list.
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], lengths[j] + 1)

    # Return the maximum length found.
    return max(lengths)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
    print("Array:", arr)
    print("Length of the longest increasing subsequence:", longest_increasing_subsequence(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Array: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
Length of the longest increasing subsequence: 6
```
