## Exercise
Create a list to store multiple variables and then perform operations on the list

## Reference Solution
```python
# Create a list to store multiple variables
variables = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Print the original list
print("Original List:", variables)

# Perform operations on the list
# Append a new variable to the end of the list
variables.append(60)
print("List after appending 60:", variables)

# Insert a new variable at a specific index
variables.insert(2, 25)
print("List after inserting 25 at index 2:", variables)

# Remove the first occurrence of a variable
variables.remove(20)
print("List after removing 20:", variables)

# Get the index of a variable
index = variables.index(40)
print("Index of 40:", index)

# Sort the list in ascending order
variables.sort()
print("List after sorting:", variables)

# Reverse the list
variables.reverse()
print("List after reversing:", variables)

# Get the length of the list
length = len(variables)
print("Length of the list:", length)

# Access a variable at a specific index
variable = variables[0]
print("Variable at index 0:", variable)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
List after appending 60: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
List after inserting 25 at index 2: [10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60]
List after removing 20: [10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 40: 3
List after sorting: [10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60]
List after reversing: [60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 10]
Length of the list: 6
Variable at index 0: 60
