## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a bank account and allows the user to deposit and withdraw money

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.

        Args:
            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount cannot be negative")
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the account balance.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount cannot be negative")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount

    def get_balance(self):
        """
        Returns the current account balance.

        Returns:
            float: The account balance.
        """
        return self.balance


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:

        print("1. Deposit money")
        print("2. Withdraw money")
        print("3. Check balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
                account.deposit(amount)
                print(f"Deposit successful. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")
        elif choice == "2":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
                account.withdraw(amount)
                print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}")
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
