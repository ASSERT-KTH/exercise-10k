## Exercise
Create a program that implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. Use a for loop to iterate over the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def insertion_sort(numbers):
    """
    Sorts a list of numbers using the insertion sort algorithm.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of numbers.
    """

    # Iterate over the list of numbers, starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Store the current element to be inserted
        current_element = numbers[i]

        # Initialize a pointer to the previous element
        j = i - 1

        # Shift elements greater than the current element to the right
        while j >= 0 and numbers[j] > current_element:
            numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j]
            j -= 1

        # Insert the current element at its correct position
        numbers[j + 1] = current_element

    return numbers


# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", insertion_sort(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
