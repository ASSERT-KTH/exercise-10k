## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a key function as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique value returned by the key function, and the corresponding value is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def group_by_key(lst, key_func):
    """
    This function takes a list and a key function as input, 
    and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique value 
    returned by the key function, and the corresponding value 
    is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list to be grouped.
        key_func (function): A function that takes an element of the list as input and returns a key.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each key is a unique value returned by the key function, 
              and the corresponding value is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped elements
    grouped_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in lst:
        # Calculate the key for the current element using the key function
        key = key_func(element)
        
        # If the key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value
        if key not in grouped_dict:
            # This is done to avoid a KeyError when trying to append to a non-existent key
            grouped_dict[key] = []
        
        # Append the current element to the list of its corresponding key in the dictionary
        grouped_dict[key].append(element)
    
    # Return the dictionary with the grouped elements
    return grouped_dict
```
