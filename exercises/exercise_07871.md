## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a word contains a specific character using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_character(word, char):
    """
    Checks if a word contains a specific character.

    Args:
        word (str): The word to check.
        char (str): The character to look for.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the word contains the character, False otherwise.
    """
    if char in word:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage:
word = input("Enter a word: ")
char = input("Enter a character: ")

if check_character(word, char):
    print(f"The word '{word}' contains the character '{char}'.")
else:
    print(f"The word '{word}' does not contain the character '{char}'.")
```

```python
def check_character(word, char):
    return char in word
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a word: Enter a character: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkqhr2ehe.py", line 19, in <module>
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```

```
