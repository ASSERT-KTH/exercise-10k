## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the total cost of items after applying discounts based on the total amount spent. If the total amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount. If the total amount is greater than $50 but less than or equal to $100, apply a 5% discount. For amounts less than or equal to $50, no discount is applied.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate total cost after discount
def calculate_total_cost(items):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of items after applying discounts.

    Args:
        items (list): A list of item prices.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost after discount.
    """
    # Calculate the total amount spent
    total_amount = sum(items)

    # Apply discounts based on the total amount spent
    if total_amount > 100:
        discount = 0.10  # 10% discount
    elif 50 < total_amount <= 100:
        discount = 0.05  # 5% discount
    else:
        discount = 0.00  # No discount

    # Calculate the total cost after discount
    total_cost = total_amount * (1 - discount)

    return total_cost


# Example usage
def main():
    # List of item prices
    items = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

    # Calculate the total cost after discount
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(items)

    # Print the result
    print("Total cost after discount: $", round(total_cost, 2))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Total cost after discount: $ 180.0
```
