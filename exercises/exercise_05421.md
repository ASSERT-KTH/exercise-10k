## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. If the score is above 90, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 90, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 80, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 70, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    score = float(input("Enter the score: "))

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score: The grade is: B
```
