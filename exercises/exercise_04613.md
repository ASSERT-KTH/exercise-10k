## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """
    Calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.
        height (float): The height of the cylinder.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the cylinder.
    """
    if radius < 0 or height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius and height must be non-negative")

    volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height
    return volume

def main():
    # Example usage
    radius = 5.0  # in units (e.g., meters, centimeters)
    height = 10.0  # in units (e.g., meters, centimeters)

    volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)
    print(f"The volume of the cylinder is {volume:.2f} cubic units")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The volume of the cylinder is 785.40 cubic units
```
