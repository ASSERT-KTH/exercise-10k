## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Gets user's name and age from input."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Age should be a number.")
    return name, age

def print_greeting(name, age):
    """Prints out a greeting message with the user's name and their age in 5 years."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.")
    print(f"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.")

def main():
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print_greeting(name, age)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Hello, John! You are currently 25 years old.
In 5 years, you will be 30 years old.
