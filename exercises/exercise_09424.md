## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the square of each number using a lambda expression

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the function
square_numbers = lambda numbers: list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)

print("Original Numbers:", numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)
```

```python
def square_numbers(numbers):
    return [x**2 for x in numbers]
```

## Generated Output
```
Original Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
