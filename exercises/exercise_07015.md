## Exercise
You are given a dictionary containing student information where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary with keys 'age' and 'grades' which is a list of their grades. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and return the result as a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(student_info):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each student.

    Args:
    student_info (dict): A dictionary containing student information.
                         Each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary
                         with keys 'age' and 'grades' which is a list of their grades.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades.
    """
    average_grades = {}
    for student, info in student_info.items():
        # Check if the student has any grades
        if info['grades']:
            # Calculate the average grade
            average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])
            average_grades[student] = average_grade
        else:
            average_grades[student] = None  # or any other value to indicate no grades

    return average_grades


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    student_info = {
        'John': {'age': 20, 'grades': [90, 85, 95]},
        'Alice': {'age': 22, 'grades': [88, 92, 89]},
        'Bob': {'age': 21, 'grades': []}
    }

    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(student_info)
    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():
        if average_grade is not None:
            print(f"The average grade for {student} is {average_grade:.2f}")
        else:
            print(f"{student} has no grades")
```

## Generated Output
```
The average grade for John is 90.00
The average grade for Alice is 89.67
Bob has no grades
```
