## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance_2d(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in 2D space.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The first point (x1, y1)
        point2 (tuple): The second point (x2, y2)

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

def calculate_distance_3d(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in 3D space.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The first point (x1, y1, z1)
        point2 (tuple): The second point (x2, y2, z2)

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points
    """
    x1, y1, z1 = point1
    x2, y2, z2 = point2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2 + (z2 - z1)**2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 2D points
    point1_2d = (1, 2)
    point2_2d = (4, 6)
    distance_2d = calculate_distance_2d(point1_2d, point2_2d)
    print(f"Distance between {point1_2d} and {point2_2d} in 2D space: {distance_2d}")

    # 3D points
    point1_3d = (1, 2, 3)
    point2_3d = (4, 6, 8)
    distance_3d = calculate_distance_3d(point1_3d, point2_3d)
    print(f"Distance between {point1_3d} and {point2_3d} in 3D space: {distance_3d}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) in 2D space: 5.0
Distance between (1, 2, 3) and (4, 6, 8) in 3D space: 7.0710678118654755
```
