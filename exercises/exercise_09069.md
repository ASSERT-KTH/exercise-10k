## Exercise
Write a program that checks the temperature and sends an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold using if statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_temperature(temperature, threshold):
    """
    Checks the temperature and sends an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature.
        threshold (float): The temperature threshold.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    if temperature > threshold:
        print(f"Temperature alert: {temperature}°C exceeds the threshold of {threshold}°C")
    else:
        print(f"Temperature is within normal range: {temperature}°C")

def main():
    # Define the temperature and threshold
    temperature = 35.0  # Current temperature in °C
    threshold = 30.0  # Temperature threshold in °C

    # Check the temperature and send an alert if necessary
    check_temperature(temperature, threshold)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Temperature alert: 35.0°C exceeds the threshold of 30.0°C
```
