## Exercise
Create a function that groups a list of tuples by a given key and applies a having condition to filter the groups.

## Reference Solution
```python
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def group_and_filter(tuples, key, having_condition):
    """
    This function groups a list of tuples by a given key and applies a having condition to filter the groups.

    Args:
        tuples (list): A list of tuples.
        key (int): The index of the tuple element to group by.
        having_condition (function): A function that takes a group as input and returns True if the group should be included in the output, False otherwise.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples that satisfy the having condition.
    """

    # First, we sort the tuples based on the key
    sorted_tuples = sorted(tuples, key=itemgetter(key))

    # Then, we group the sorted tuples by the key
    grouped_tuples = groupby(sorted_tuples, key=itemgetter(key))

    # We initialize an empty list to store the filtered groups
    filtered_groups = []

    # We iterate over each group
    for _, group in grouped_tuples:
        # We convert the group to a list because groupby returns an iterator
        group_list = list(group)

        # We apply the having condition to the group
        if having_condition(group_list):
            # If the condition is met, we add the group to the filtered groups
            filtered_groups.extend(group_list)

    # Finally, we return the filtered groups
    return filtered_groups

# Example usage:
tuples = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
key = 0
having_condition = lambda group: len(group) > 1

print(group_and_filter(tuples, key, having_condition))
```

## Generated Output
```
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
```
