## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and then prints a Mad Libs story using these words.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for noun, verb, and adjective"""
    noun = input("Enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
    adjective = input("Enter an adjective: ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

def print_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective):
    """Print Mad Libs story using user input"""
    story = f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. " \
            f"Suddenly, it started to {verb} and everyone was surprised."
    print(story)

def main():
    """Main function"""
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    print_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a noun: Enter a verb: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpx0vmp5c5.py", line 20, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpx0vmp5c5.py", line 16, in main
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpx0vmp5c5.py", line 4, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
