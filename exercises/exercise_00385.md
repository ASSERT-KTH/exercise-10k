## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
    return distance

def main():
    # Get the coordinates of the two points
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Calculate the distance
    point1 = (x1, y1)
    point2 = (x2, y2)
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpl75ccq4i.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpl75ccq4i.py", line 21, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '(1, 2) (4, 6)'
```
