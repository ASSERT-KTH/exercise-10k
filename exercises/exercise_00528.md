## Exercise
Implement a function to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start, end):
    """
    Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

    Args:
    graph (dict): Adjacency list representation of the graph.
    start (node): Starting node.
    end (node): Ending node.

    Returns:
    tuple: Shortest distance and path from start to end.
    """
    # Initialize distances and previous nodes
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    previous = {node: None for node in graph}

    # Priority queue to store nodes to visit
    queue = [(0, start)]

    while queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

        # Skip if current node is already visited with shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Visit neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Update distance and previous node if shorter path found
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # Build the shortest path
    path = []
    current_node = end
    while current_node is not None:
        path.append(current_node)
        current_node = previous[current_node]
    path.reverse()

    return distances[end], path


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
    }

    start_node = 'A'
    end_node = 'D'

    distance, path = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)
    print(f"Shortest distance from {start_node} to {end_node}: {distance}")
    print(f"Path: {' -> '.join(path)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Shortest distance from A to D: 4
Path: A -> B -> C -> D
```
