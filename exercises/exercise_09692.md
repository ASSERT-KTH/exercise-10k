## Exercise
Create a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to n, but with a twist. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Loopy' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, print 'Printer' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'LoopyPrinter'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_numbers(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print('LoopyPrinter')
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print('Loopy')
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print('Printer')
        else:
            print(i)

# Test the function
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print_numbers(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1
2
Loopy
4
Printer
Loopy
7
8
Loopy
Printer
```
