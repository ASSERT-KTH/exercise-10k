Create a program that counts the number of lines in a given text using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_lines(text):
    """

    """
    line_count = 0
    for line in text.split('\n'):
        line_count += 1
    return line_count

# Example usage
text = """This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the third line."""
print(count_lines(text))
```

```python
def count_lines(text):
    return len(text.split('\n'))

# Example usage
text = """This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the third line."""
print(count_lines(text))
```
