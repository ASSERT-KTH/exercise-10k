## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    score = float(input("Enter your score: "))
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Your grade is {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is B
```
