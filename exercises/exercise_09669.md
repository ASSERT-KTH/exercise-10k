## Exercise
Write a program that asks for two strings and combines them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_strings():
    """
    Asks for two strings and combines them into a single string.
    """
    # Ask for the first string
    str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")

    # Ask for the second string
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

    # Combine the strings
    combined_str = str1 + str2

    # Print the combined string
    print("Combined string: ", combined_str)

def main():
    combine_strings()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first string: Enter the second string: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmprombvea5.py", line 21, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmprombvea5.py", line 18, in main
    combine_strings()
  File "/tmp/tmprombvea5.py", line 9, in combine_strings
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
