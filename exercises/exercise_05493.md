## Exercise
Write a program to find the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_missing_number(sequence):
    """
    Find the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.

    Args:
    sequence (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The missing number in the sequence.
    """
    # Calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete
    complete_sum = sum(range(min(sequence), max(sequence) + 1))

    # Calculate the actual sum of the sequence
    actual_sum = sum(sequence)

    # The missing number is the difference between the complete sum and the actual sum
    missing_number = complete_sum - actual_sum

    return missing_number

# Example usage
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5]
missing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)
print("The missing number is:", missing_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
The missing number is: 4
```
