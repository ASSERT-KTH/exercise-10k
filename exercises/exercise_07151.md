## Exercise
Create a function to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters: length and width. It should return a dictionary with the keys 'area' and 'perimeter' containing the respective calculated values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):
    """
    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

    Parameters:
    length (float): The length of the rectangle.
    width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the keys 'area' and 'perimeter' with their respective calculated values.
    """

    # First, we need to calculate the area of the rectangle. The formula for this is length * width.
    area = length * width
    
    # Next, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for this is 2 * (length + width).
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    
    # Now, we need to create a dictionary to store our results. We'll use the keys 'area' and 'perimeter' as specified.
    result = {}
    
    # Add the calculated area to the dictionary.
    result['area'] = area
    
    # Add the calculated perimeter to the dictionary.
    result['perimeter'] = perimeter
    
    # Finally, return the dictionary containing our results.
    return result

# Example usage:
print(calculate_rectangle_properties(5, 3))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'area': 15, 'perimeter': 16}
```
