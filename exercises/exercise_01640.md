## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique character in the string and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character.

## Reference Solution
```python
def char_frequency(string):
    """
    Returns a dictionary where each key is a unique character in the string 
    and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    frequency = {}
    for char in string:
        if char in frequency:
            frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency[char] = 1
    return frequency

def main():
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    print(char_frequency(string))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}
```
