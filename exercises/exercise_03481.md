## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

# Get the numbers from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate and print the sum
result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpj3m77lop.py", line 15, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
