## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their respective grades as input. The program should then calculate the average grade and print out the student names with their grades, along with the average grade. If a student's grade is above the average, mark it as 'Above Average', if it's below the average, mark it as 'Below Average', and if it's equal to the average, mark it as 'Average'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade(grades):
    """
    Calculate the average grade and print out the student names with their grades,
    along with the average grade.

    Args:
        grades (dict): A dictionary of student names and their respective grades.
    """

    # Calculate the sum of all grades
    total_grade = sum(grades.values())

    # Calculate the average grade
    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)

    # Print the average grade
    print(f"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}")

    # Print each student's name, grade, and their status compared to the average
    for student, grade in grades.items():
        if grade > average_grade:
            status = 'Above Average'
        elif grade < average_grade:
            status = 'Below Average'
        else:
            status = 'Average'

        print(f"{student}: {grade:.2f} - {status}")


# Example usage:
grades = {
    "John": 85,
    "Alice": 90,
    "Bob": 78,
    "Charlie": 92,
    "David": 88
}

calculate_average_grade(grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
Average Grade: 86.60
John: 85.00 - Below Average
Alice: 90.00 - Above Average
Bob: 78.00 - Below Average
Charlie: 92.00 - Above Average
David: 88.00 - Above Average
```
