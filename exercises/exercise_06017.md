## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a name, a location, and an object, and prints out a story using those words

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for name, location, and object."""
    name = input("Please enter a name: ")
    location = input("Please enter a location: ")
    object_name = input("Please enter an object: ")
    return name, location, object_name

def generate_story(name, location, object_name):
    """Generate a story using the user input."""
    story = f"""
Once upon a time, in the beautiful {location}, there lived a person named {name}.
{name} was known for their love of adventure and one day, they stumbled upon a mysterious {object_name}.
As soon as {name} touched the {object_name}, they were transported to a magical world.
In this world, {name} encountered strange creatures and had many exciting experiences.
But in the end, {name} returned to {location} with their trusty {object_name} by their side.
"""
    return story

def main():
    """Main function to run the program."""
    name, location, object_name = get_user_input()
    story = generate_story(name, location, object_name)
    print("Here is your story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a name: Please enter a location: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkyec3gjw.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkyec3gjw.py", line 21, in main
    name, location, object_name = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpkyec3gjw.py", line 4, in get_user_input
    location = input("Please enter a location: ")
