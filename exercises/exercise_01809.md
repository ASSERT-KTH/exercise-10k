## Exercise
Write a program that scores a quiz based on user answers, using conditional statements to determine the correct answers

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the quiz questions and answers
quiz_questions = {
    "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": "Jupiter",
    "Which programming language is this quiz written in?": "Python",
    "What is the largest mammal?": "Blue whale",
    "What is the chemical symbol for gold?": "Au"
}

def quiz():
    # Initialize the score
    score = 0

    # Iterate over the quiz questions
    for question, answer in quiz_questions.items():
        # Ask the user for their answer
        user_answer = input(question + " ")

        # Check if the user's answer is correct
        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\n")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.")

# Start the quiz
quiz()
```
