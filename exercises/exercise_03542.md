## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(list_to_filter, condition):
    filter_list = []
    for element in list_to_filter:
        if condition(element):
            filter_list.append(element)
    return filter_list

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

def is_divisible_by_two(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

divisible_by_two = filter_list(numbers, is_divisible_by_two)

def is_divisible_by_three(num):
    return num % 3 == 0

divisible_by_three = filter_list(numbers, is_divisible_by_three)
```
