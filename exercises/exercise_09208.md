## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The function should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(input_str):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
    
    It handles strings of any length and does not use any built-in string reversal functions.
    
    Parameters:
    input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.
    
    Returns:
    str: The reversed string.
    """
    
    # Initialize an empty string to store the reversed string
    reversed_str = ""
    
    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current character index
    # We start from the end of the string and move backwards to the beginning
    i = len(input_str) - 1
    
    # Continue the loop until we have processed all characters in the string
    while i >= 0:
        # In each iteration, append the current character to the reversed string
        # We use the index i to access the current character in the input string
        reversed_str += input_str[i]
        
        # Decrement the index to move to the previous character in the next iteration
        i -= 1
    
    # After the loop, the reversed string is complete, so we return it
    return reversed_str

# Test the function
print(reverse_string("Hello World"))  # Output: "dlroW olleH"
```

## Generated Output
```
dlroW olleH
```
