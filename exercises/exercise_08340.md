## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is an even number. After printing the even numbers, the program should print out the sum of all the even numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_even_numbers():
    # Initialize sum
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through numbers 1 to 10
    for i in range(1, 11):
        # Check if the number is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Print the even number
            print(i)
            # Add the even number to the sum
            total_sum += i
    
    # Print the sum of all even numbers
    print("Sum of even numbers:", total_sum)

# Call the function
print_even_numbers()
```

## Generated Output
```
