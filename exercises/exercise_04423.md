    total = 0
    for grade in grades:
        total += grade
    return total / len(grades)


def main():
    grades = [90, 80, 70, 95, 85]
    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)
    print(f"The average grade is: {average_grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def calculate_average_grade(grades):
    if not grades:
        return None
    total = 0
    for grade in grades:
