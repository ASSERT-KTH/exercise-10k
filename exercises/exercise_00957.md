## Exercise
Write a program that prints all permutations of a list of numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import itertools

def print_permutations(numbers):
    """
    Prints all permutations of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    """
    # Generate all permutations of the list of numbers
    permutations = itertools.permutations(numbers)

    # Print each permutation
    for i, permutation in enumerate(permutations):
        print(f"Permutation {i+1}: {permutation}")

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print_permutations(numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Permutation 1: (1, 2, 3)
Permutation 2: (1, 3, 2)
Permutation 3: (2, 1, 3)
Permutation 4: (2, 3, 1)
Permutation 5: (3, 1, 2)
Permutation 6: (3, 2, 1)
```
