## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then validates if the age is within the range of 18 to 65. If the age is valid, print out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is not valid, ask for the age again until a valid age is entered.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <exception>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int age;

    // Ask for name and age
    cout << "What is your name? ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "What is your age? ";
    cin >> age;

    // Validate age
    while (age < 18 || age > 65) {
        cout << "Invalid age. Please enter an age between 18 and 65: ";
        cin >> age;
    }

    // Print greeting
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
