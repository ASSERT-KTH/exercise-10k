## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, a person is eligible to vote if they are 18 years old or more.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility():
    """
    Asks for a person's age and checks if they are eligible to vote.
    """
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_voting_eligibility()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your age: You are not eligible to vote.
```
