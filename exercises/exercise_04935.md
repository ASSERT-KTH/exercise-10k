## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The program should use the formula volume = side_length ** 3 to calculate the volume.

## Reference Solution
```python
def cube_volume():
    s = float(input("Enter side length of cube: "))
    volume = s ** 3
    print(f"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f}")

cube_volume()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter side length of cube: The volume of the cube is: 125.00
```
