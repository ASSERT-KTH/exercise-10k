## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and an element as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.

## Reference Solution
```python
def first_occurrence_index(lst, ele):
    if lst is None:
        return -1
    try:
        return lst.index(ele)
    except ValueError:
        return -1

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
ele = 5
print(first_occurrence_index(lst, ele))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
```
4
```
