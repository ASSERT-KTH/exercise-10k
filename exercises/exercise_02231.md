## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and a partition value as input, and returns two arrays: one with elements less than the partition value, and one with elements greater than or equal to the partition value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def Partition(arr, p):
    left = [x for x in arr if x < p]
    right = [x for x in arr if x >= p]

    return left, right

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
p = 5

left, right = Partition(arr, p)

print(left)
print(right)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
