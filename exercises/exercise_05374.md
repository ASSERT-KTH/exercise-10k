## Exercise
Write a program to find the intersection of two or more lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def list_intersection(*lists):
    """
    Finds the intersection of two or more lists.

    Args:
        *lists: Variable number of lists to find the intersection of.

    Returns:
        A new list containing only the elements that are common to all input lists.
    """
    if not lists:
        return []

    # Initialize the intersection with the first list
    intersection = set(lists[0])

    # Iterate over the remaining lists and update the intersection
    for lst in lists[1:]:
        intersection &= set(lst)

    return list(intersection)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    list3 = [3, 4, 5, 9, 10]

    intersection = list_intersection(list1, list2, list3)
    print("Intersection:", intersection)

    # Output:
    # Intersection: [4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
Intersection: [4, 5]
```
