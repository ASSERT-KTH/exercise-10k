## Exercise
Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_char(string, char):
    return string.count(char)

string = input("Enter a string: ")
char = input("Enter a character: ")

print(f"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.")
```

```python
def count_char(string, char):
    count = 0
    for c in string:
        if c == char:
            count += 1
    return count

string = input("Enter a string: ")
char = input("Enter a character: ")

print(f"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Enter a character: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpyty1qjn6.py", line 5, in <module>
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```

```
Enter a string: Enter a character: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkvwxtzdz.py", line 9, in <module>
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
