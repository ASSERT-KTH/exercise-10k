## Exercise
Create a function to find the maximum flow in a flow network from a source node to a sink node.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, source, sink, parent):
    """
    Breadth-first search to check if there is a path from source to sink.

    Args:
    graph (list): The residual graph.
    source (int): The source node.
    sink (int): The sink node.
    parent (list): The parent array to store the augmenting path.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there is a path from source to sink, False otherwise.

    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(source)

    Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow in a flow network.

    Args:

    Returns:

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = [[0, 16, 13, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 10, 12, 0, 0],
             [0, 4, 0, 0, 14, 0],

    source = 0
    sink = 5

    print("Maximum flow:", max_flow)

## Generated Output
```
Maximum flow: 23
