## Exercise
Write a program that responds to basic user queries. The program should print out a greeting message and then repeatedly ask the user for input and respond accordingly.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary to store responses to basic user queries
responses = {
    'hello': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?',
    'help': 'You can ask me anything, and I will do my best to help.',
    'exit': 'Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.',
    'default': 'Sorry, I did not understand that. Please try again.'
}

def main():
    # Print out a greeting message
    print("Welcome to the chat program! Type 'hello' to start, 'help' for assistance, or 'exit' to quit.")

    while True:
        # Ask the user for input
        user_input = input("You: ").lower()

        # Check if the user wants to exit the program
        if user_input == 'exit':
            print("Program: ", responses['exit'])
            break

        # Check if the user needs help
        elif user_input == 'help':
            print("Program: ", responses['help'])

        # Check if the user says hello
        elif user_input == 'hello':
            print("Program: ", responses['hello'])

        # If the user's input does not match any of the above conditions, print the default response
        else:
            print("Program: ", responses['default'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chat program! Type 'hello' to start, 'help' for assistance, or 'exit' to quit.
You: Program:  Hello! How can I assist you today?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp7oakb5g0.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp7oakb5g0.py", line 15, in main
    user_input = input("You: ").lower()
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
