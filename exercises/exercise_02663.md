## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string, a substring to replace, and a replacement string as input, and returns the modified string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def replace_string(s, sub, rep):
    l = len(sub)
    res = ""
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i:i + l] == sub:
            res += rep
            i += l
        else:
            res += s[i]
            i += 1
    return res

s = "Hello, world! Hello again!"
sub = "Hello"
rep = "Goodbye"
print(replace_string(s, sub, rep))
```

## Generated Output
```
Goodbye, world! Goodbye again!
```
