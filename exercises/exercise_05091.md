## Exercise
Write a program that takes the current temperature and weather condition as input and prints out a message describing the weather.

## Reference Solution
```python
def describe_weather(temperature, condition):
    """
    Prints out a message describing the weather based on the given temperature and condition.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
        condition (str): The current weather condition (e.g. "sunny", "cloudy", "rainy", etc.).
    """
    print(f"The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")

def main():
    # Get the current temperature and weather condition from the user
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    condition = input("Enter the current weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.): ")

    # Describe the weather
    describe_weather(temperature, condition)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def describe_weather(temperature, condition):
    if temperature < 0:
        print(f"It's freezing outside! The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")
    elif temperature < 10:
        print(f"It's cold outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")
    elif temperature < 20:
        print(f"It's mild outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")
    elif temperature < 30:
        print(f"It's warm outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")
    else:
        print(f"It's hot outside! The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.")

    if condition == "sunny":
        print("Don't forget your sunscreen!")
    elif condition == "rainy":
        print("You might want to bring an umbrella.")
    elif condition == "cloudy":
        print("It's a good day to stay indoors.")

def main():
    # Get the current temperature and weather condition from the user
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    condition = input("Enter the current weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.): ")

    # Describe the weather
    describe_weather(temperature, condition)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius:
