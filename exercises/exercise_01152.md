## Exercise
Create a program that plays Tic Tac Toe with the user. The program should generate a random move for the computer and let the user make moves.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# Initialize the game board
def initialize_board():
    return [' ' for _ in range(9)]

# Print the game board
def print_board(board):
    print(f' {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} ')
    print('-----------')
    print(f' {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} ')
    print('-----------')
    print(f' {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} ')

# Check if a player has won
def check_win(board, player):
    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] == player:
            return True
    return False

# Check if the game is a draw
def check_draw(board):
    return ' ' not in board

# Get the computer's move
def get_computer_move(board):
    available_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == ' ']
    return random.choice(available_moves)

# Main game loop
def play_game():
    board = initialize_board()
    current_player = 'X'
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        if current_player == 'X':
            move = input("Enter your move (1-9): ")
            if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':
                print("Invalid move, try again.")
                continue
            board[int(move) - 1] = 'X'
            if check_win(board, 'X'):
                print_board(board)
                print("You win!")
                break
            elif check_draw(board):
                print_board(board)
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            current_player = 'O'
        else:
            move = get_computer_move(board)
            board[move] = 'O'
            print(f"Computer's move: {move + 1}")
            if check_win(board, 'O'):
                print_board(board)
                print("Computer wins!")
                break
            elif check_draw(board):
                print_board(board)
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            current_player = 'X'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
