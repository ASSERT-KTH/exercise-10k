## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to determine the movie rating based on the user's age and the movie's rating.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_movie_rating(user_age, movie_rating):
    """
    Determine the movie rating based on the user's age and the movie's rating.

    Args:
        user_age (int): The user's age.
        movie_rating (str): The movie's rating (G, PG, PG-13, R).

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the user is allowed to watch the movie.
    """
    if movie_rating == "G":
        return "You are allowed to watch this movie."
    elif movie_rating == "PG":
        if user_age >= 8:
            return "You are allowed to watch this movie with parental guidance."
        else:
            return "You are not allowed to watch this movie."
    elif movie_rating == "PG-13":
        if user_age >= 13:
            return "You are allowed to watch this movie with parental guidance."
        else:
            return "You are not allowed to watch this movie."
    elif movie_rating == "R":
        if user_age >= 17:
            return "You are allowed to watch this movie."
        else:
            return "You are not allowed to watch this movie."
    else:
        return "Invalid movie rating."

def main():
    user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    movie_rating = input("Enter the movie's rating (G, PG, PG-13, R): ")
    print(determine_movie_rating(user_age, movie_rating))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9bnafdai.py", line 38, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9bnafdai.py", line 33, in main
    user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '18 PG-13'
```
