## Exercise
Create a function to find the first occurrence of a substring within a given string. The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring(main_string, sub_string):
    """
    This function finds the first occurrence of a substring within a given string.
    
    Args:
        main_string (str): The string in which we are searching for the substring.
        sub_string (str): The substring that we are searching for.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.
    """

    # First, we check if the main string and the substring are not None
    if main_string is None or sub_string is None:
        raise ValueError("Neither the main string nor the substring can be None")

    # We use Python's built-in str.find() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring
    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1
    # This method is case-sensitive and considers 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings
    index = main_string.find(sub_string)

    # We return the index, which is either the position of the substring or -1
    return index
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
