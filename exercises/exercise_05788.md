## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Parameters:
    point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).
    point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).

    Returns:
    float: The distance between the two points.
    """

    # First, we need to unpack the coordinates from the input tuples
    x1, y1 = point1
    
    # We do the same for the second point
    x2, y2 = point2
    
    # Then, we calculate the difference in x and y coordinates
    # This is done by subtracting the corresponding coordinates of the two points
    dx = x2 - x1
    
    # Same for the y coordinates
    dy = y2 - y1
    
    # The distance formula is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2), so we calculate the squares first
    # We use the ** operator to raise a number to a power
    dx_squared = dx ** 2
    
    # Same for the y difference
    dy_squared = dy ** 2
    
    # Now we add the squares together
    sum_of_squares = dx_squared + dy_squared
    
    # Finally, we take the square root of the sum to get the distance
    # We use the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root
    distance = math.sqrt(sum_of_squares)
    
    # We return the calculated distance
    return distance

# Example usage:
point1 = (1, 2)
point2 = (4, 6)
print(calculate_distance(point1, point2))
