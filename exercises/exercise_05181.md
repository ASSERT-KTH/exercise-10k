## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. If the guess is higher than the number, print 'too high'. If the guess is lower than the number, print 'too low'. If the guess is correct, print 'you won!' and exit the program.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high")
        else:
            print("You won!")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
