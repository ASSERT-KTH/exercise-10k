## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the compound interest given the principal, rate, and time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency=1):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
    - principal (float): The initial amount of money.
    - rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal).
    - time (int): The time the money is invested for in years.
    - compounding_frequency (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
    - float: The amount of money accumulated after the given time, including interest.
    - float: The compound interest.
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounding_frequency)**(compounding_frequency*time)
    interest = amount - principal
    return amount, interest


def main():
    # Example usage
    principal = 1000  # Initial amount of money
    rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (5%)
    time = 5  # Time in years
    compounding_frequency = 1  # Compounded annually

    amount, interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency)

    print(f"Principal: ${principal:.2f}")
    print(f"Annual Interest Rate: {rate*100}%")
    print(f"Time: {time} years")
    print(f"Compounding Frequency: {compounding_frequency} time(s) per year")
    print(f"Amount after {time} years: ${amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Compound Interest: ${interest:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Principal: $1000.00
Annual Interest Rate: 5.0%
Time: 5 years
Compounding Frequency: 1 time(s) per year
Amount after 5 years: $1276.28
Compound Interest: $276.28
```
