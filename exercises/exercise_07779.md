## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The message should be in the format 'Hello, <name>!'. Ensure the program handles different types of input, such as names with multiple words or special characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_greeting(name):
    """
    This function takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message.
    
    Parameters:
    name (str): The user's name
    
    Returns:
    None
    """

    # Now, we will use an f-string to format the greeting message with the provided name
    greeting_message = f"Hello, {name}!"

    # Finally, we print the greeting message
    print(greeting_message)


def main():
    """
    This is the main function where we take the user's name as input and call the print_greeting function.
    
    Returns:
    None
    """

    # We use the input function to get the user's name
    # The input function returns a string, so we don't need to do any type conversion
    user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

    # We call the print_greeting function with the user's name
    print_greeting(user_name)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # We call the main function when the script is run
    main()
```
