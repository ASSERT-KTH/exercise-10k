## Exercise
Store a decimal number in a float variable and perform basic arithmetic operations on it.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define float variables
num1 = 10.5
num2 = 2.8

# Basic arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Print results
print(f"Number 1: {num1}")
print(f"Number 2: {num2}")
print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Number 1: 10.5
Number 2: 2.8
Addition: 10.5 + 2.8 = 13.3
Subtraction: 10.5 - 2.8 = 7.7
Multiplication: 10.5 * 2.8 = 29.4
Division: 10.5 / 2.8 = 3.7500000000000004
