## Exercise
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices separately. The function should return a list or array with two elements, where the first element is the sum of elements at even indices and the second element is the sum of elements at odd indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_odd_indices(array):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices in a given array.

    Args:
        array (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list with two elements, where the first element is the sum of elements at even indices and the second element is the sum of elements at odd indices.
    """

    # Initialize two variables to store the sum of elements at even and odd indices
    even_sum = 0
    
    # Initialize the variable for odd sum
    odd_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the array with the index and value
    for i, num in enumerate(array):
        
        # Check if the index is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # If the index is even, add the value to the even sum
            even_sum += num
        else:
            # If the index is odd, add the value to the odd sum
            odd_sum += num
    
    # Return a list with the even sum and the odd sum
    return [even_sum, odd_sum]

# Test the function
print(sum_even_odd_indices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))
```
