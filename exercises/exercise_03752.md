## Exercise
Create a program to generate Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows in Pascal's triangle.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.
    """
    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]
    for i in range(2, n):
        for j in range(1, i):
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
    return triangle

def print_pascals_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print Pascal's triangle in a readable format.

    Args:
        triangle (list): A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - len(row)), end='')
        for num in row:
            print(f'{num} ', end='')
        print()

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows:     1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
```
