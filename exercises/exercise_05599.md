## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def power_function(base, exponent):
    """
    This function calculates the power of a given base and exponent.
    
    Parameters:
    base (float): The base number
    exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised
    
    Returns:
    float: The result of the base raised to the power of the exponent
    """

    # First, we need to check if the inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(base, (int, float)) or not isinstance(exponent, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both base and exponent must be numbers")

    # Now, we use the built-in ** operator in Python to calculate the power.
    # This operator returns the value of the left operand raised to the power of the right operand.
    result = base ** exponent

    # Finally, we return the calculated result.
    return result
```
