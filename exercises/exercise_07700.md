        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.
    """
    return sum([n ** 2 for n in numbers])

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 55
```

```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    return sum(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
```
