## Exercise
Write a program that creates a bank account manager using if/else statement

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder, balance):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposit successful. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please try again.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawal successful. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")
        elif amount <= 0:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please try again.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds. Please try again.")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Your current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}")

def main():
    account_number = input("Enter your account number: ")
    account_holder = input("Enter your name: ")
    balance = float(input("Enter your initial balance: "))

    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_holder, balance)

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Manager")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your account number: Enter your name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpp6fv5dj1.py", line 57, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpp6fv5dj1.py", line 28, in main
    account_holder = input("Enter your name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
