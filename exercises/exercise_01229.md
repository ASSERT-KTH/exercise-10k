## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a matrix based on a given number of rows and columns.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Output:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9

# Explanation:
# This code uses nested for loops to print a matrix based on the given number of rows and columns.
# The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.
# The value of the cell is calculated as (row * numColumns) + column + 1, where row and column are 0-based indices.
# This ensures that the values are printed in a continuous sequence from 1 to numRows * numColumns.

numRows = 3
numColumns = 3

for row in range(numRows):
    for column in range(numColumns):
        print((row * numColumns) + column + 1, end=' ')
    print()
```

## Generated Output
```
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9
```
