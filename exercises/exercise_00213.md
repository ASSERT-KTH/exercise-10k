## Exercise
Create a function that prompts the user for their name and returns it.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function called 'get_user_name' that will prompt the user for their name and return it.
def get_user_name():
    """
    This function prompts the user for their name and returns it.

    Returns:
        str: The user's name.
    """

    # Use the built-in 'input' function in Python to prompt the user for their name.
    # The string 'Please enter your name: ' is used as a prompt to inform the user what to do.
    user_name = input('Please enter your name: ')

    # Return the user's name.
    # This will make the name available to the part of the program that called this function.
    return user_name

# Call the function and store the result in a variable.
# This is an example of how you might use this function in a larger program.
user_name = get_user_name()

# Print the user's name to the console.
# This is just an example of what you might do with the user's name after you've got it.
print('Hello, ' + user_name + '!')
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Hello, John!
```
