## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the surface area of a sphere

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_surface_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the surface area of a sphere.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.

    Returns:
        float: The surface area of the sphere.
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")

    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return surface_area

# Example usage:
radius = 5
surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)
print(f"The surface area of the sphere with radius {radius} is {surface_area:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The surface area of the sphere with radius 5 is 314.16
```
