## Exercise
Create a function that takes some parameters and returns a new function that is customized based on those parameters.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining our function. This function will take some parameters and return a new function.
def create_function(param1, param2):
    """
    This function creates and returns a new function based on the provided parameters.
    
    Args:
        param1 (str): The first parameter.
        param2 (str): The second parameter.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function that is customized based on the provided parameters.
    """

    # Now, we define the new function inside our original function. This new function will have access to the parameters of the original function.
    def new_function(name):
        # The new function will print out a greeting message with the provided name and the parameters from the original function.
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {param1} and from {param2}.")

    # Finally, we return the new function.
    return new_function

# Now, let's test our function by creating a new function with some parameters.
new_func = create_function("awesome", "New York")

# We can now use our new function to print out a greeting message.
new_func("John")
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello, John! You are awesome and from New York.
```
