## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize the counter variable
i = 1

# Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
while i <= 10:
    # Check if the current number is 5
    if i == 5:
        # If it is 5, skip to the next iteration of the loop
        i += 1
        continue
    # If it's not 5, print the number
    print(i)
    # Increment the counter variable
    i += 1
```

## Generated Output
