## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def concat_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """Concatenates two arrays into one."""
    return arr1 + arr2

# Example usage:
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = concat_arrays(array1, array2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
