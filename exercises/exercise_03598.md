## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_distance(speed, time):
    """
    Calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.

    Args:
        speed (float): The speed of the object in meters per second.
        time (float): The time traveled in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The distance traveled in meters.
    """
    distance = speed * time
    return distance

def main():
    print("Distance Calculator Program")
    print("----------------------------")

    speed = float(input("Enter the speed in meters per second: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))

    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)

    print(f"The distance traveled is {distance} meters.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Distance Calculator Program
----------------------------
Enter the speed in meters per second: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8cv3n5uh.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp8cv3n5uh.py", line 19, in main
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed in meters per second: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 2'
