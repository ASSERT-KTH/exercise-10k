## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def char_frequency(string):
    """
    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the input string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.
    """
    frequency = {}
    for char in string:
        if char in frequency:
            frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency[char] = 1
    return frequency

# Example usage:
def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    frequency = char_frequency(input_string)
    print("Character Frequency:")
    for char, freq in frequency.items():
        print(f"{char}: {freq}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
from collections import Counter

def char_frequency(string):
    """
    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the input string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.
    """
    return Counter(string)

# Example usage remains the same as before.
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Character Frequency:
h: 1
e: 1
l: 3
o: 2
 : 1
w: 1
r: 1
d: 1
```
