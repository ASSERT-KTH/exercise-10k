## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the energy consumption of a device based on its usage. The program should use if/else statements to determine the energy consumption category.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_energy_consumption(device_name, usage_hours, power_consumption):
    """
    Calculate the energy consumption of a device.

    Args:
    - device_name (str): The name of the device.
    - usage_hours (float): The number of hours the device is used per day.
    - power_consumption (float): The power consumption of the device in watts.

    Returns:
    - energy_consumption (float): The daily energy consumption of the device in watt-hours.
    - category (str): The energy consumption category of the device.
    """
    # Calculate the energy consumption in watt-hours
    energy_consumption = usage_hours * power_consumption

    # Determine the energy consumption category
    if energy_consumption <= 10:
        category = "Low"
    elif energy_consumption <= 50:
        category = "Moderate"
    elif energy_consumption <= 100:
        category = "High"
    else:
        category = "Very High"

    return energy_consumption, category


def main():
    # Example usage
    device_name = "Laptop"
    usage_hours = 8
    power_consumption = 65  # watts

    energy_consumption, category = calculate_energy_consumption(
        device_name, usage_hours, power_consumption
    )

    print(f"Device: {device_name}")
    print(f"Daily Energy Consumption: {energy_consumption} Wh")
    print(f"Energy Consumption Category: {category}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Device: Laptop
Daily Energy Consumption: 520 Wh
Energy Consumption Category: Very High
```
