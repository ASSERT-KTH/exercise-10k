## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the distance given the speed and time. The program should use the formula distance = speed * time to calculate the distance.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_distance(speed, time):
    """
    Calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.

    Args:
        speed (float): The speed of the object in units per second.
        time (float): The time traveled in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The distance traveled in units.
    """
    distance = speed * time
    return distance

def main():
    # Get user input for speed and time
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed in units per second: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))

    # Calculate the distance
    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The distance traveled is {distance} units.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the speed in units per second: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp0kvynkpf.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp0kvynkpf.py", line 17, in main
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed in units per second: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 2'
```
