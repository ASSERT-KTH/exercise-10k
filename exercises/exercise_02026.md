## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the tax amount based on the income. The program should use if/else statements to determine the tax rate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount based on the income.
    
    Args:
        income (float): The income amount.
    
    Returns:
        float: The tax amount.
    """
    if income <= 10000:
        tax_rate = 0
    elif income <= 20000:
        tax_rate = 0.10
    elif income <= 50000:
        tax_rate = 0.20
    else:
        tax_rate = 0.30
    
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)
    print(f"Your tax amount is: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Your take-home pay is: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $Your tax amount is: $10000.00
Your take-home pay is: $40000.00
```
