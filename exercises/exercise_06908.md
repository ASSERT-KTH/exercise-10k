## Exercise
Write a program to classify a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def classify_grade(score):
    """
    Classify a student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
        score (int): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Test the function
    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]
    for score in scores:
        grade = classify_grade(score)
        print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Score: 95, Grade: A
Score: 85, Grade: B
Score: 75, Grade: C
Score: 65, Grade: D
Score: 55, Grade: F
```
