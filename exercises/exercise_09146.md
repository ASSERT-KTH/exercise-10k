## Exercise
Create two float variables and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them, then print out the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Create two float variables
    num1 = 10.5
    num2 = 2.5

    # Perform basic arithmetic operations
    addition = num1 + num2
    subtraction = num1 - num2
    multiplication = num1 * num2
    division = num1 / num2

    # Print the results
    print("Results of Arithmetic Operations:")
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}")
    print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Results of Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: 10.5 + 2.5 = 13.0
Subtraction: 10.5 - 2.5 = 8.0
Multiplication: 10.5 * 2.5 = 26.25
Division: 10.5 / 2.5 = 4.2
```
