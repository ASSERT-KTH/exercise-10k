## Exercise
Create a function called 'calculate_area' that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns the area of the circle. The function should also handle invalid input, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle if the input is valid, otherwise None.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a number. If it's not, we immediately return None.
    if not isinstance(radius, (int, float)):
        return None

    # Next, we check if the radius is negative. If it is, we return None because a circle cannot have a negative radius.
    if radius < 0:
        return None

    # Now that we've validated our input, we can calculate the area of the circle using the formula πr^2.
    # We use the math.pi constant for π and the ** operator for exponentiation.
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

    # Finally, we return the calculated area.
    return area
```
