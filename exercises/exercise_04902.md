## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the grade boundaries
grade_boundaries = {
    'A': (90, 100),
    'B': (80, 89),
    'C': (70, 79),
    'D': (60, 69),
    'F': (0, 59)
}

# Define the main function
def get_grade(score):
    # Check if the score is within the boundaries of each grade
    for grade, boundaries in grade_boundaries.items():
        if boundaries[0] <= score <= boundaries[1]:
            return grade

# Get the student's score from the user
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Get the grade based on the score
grade = get_grade(score)

# Print the grade
print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
