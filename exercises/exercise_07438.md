## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student passed or failed based on a conditional statement. The passing grade is 50.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int grade;

    cout << "Enter the grade: ";
    cin >> grade;

    if (grade >= 50) {
        cout << "The student has passed." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The student has failed." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
