## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to print out all the even numbers from 1 to n, where n is a number provided by the user. The program should also calculate the sum of these even numbers and print it out at the end.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Variable Lifetime Program

def outer_function():
    """
    This function demonstrates the concept of variable lifetime.
    """
    # Static variable
    static_var = 10

    def inner_function():
        # Automatic variable
        auto_var = 20
        print("Inside inner_function: ")
        print(f"Static variable: {static_var}")
        print(f"Automatic variable: {auto_var}")

    inner_function()
    print("Inside outer_function: ")
    print(f"Static variable: {static_var}")
    try:
        print(f"Automatic variable: {auto_var}")
    except NameError:
        print("Automatic variable is not accessible here.")

# Dynamic variable
dynamic_var = None

def main():
    global dynamic_var
    dynamic_var = 30
    outer_function()
    print("In main function: ")
    print(f"Dynamic variable: {dynamic_var}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Inside inner_function: 
Static variable: 10
Automatic variable: 20
Inside outer_function: 
Static variable: 10
Automatic variable is not accessible here.
In main function: 
Dynamic variable: 30
```
