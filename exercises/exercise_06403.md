## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use if/else statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100."

    # Use if/else statements to determine the grade
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Main function
def main():
    # Ask the user for their score
    score = float(input("Enter your score: "))

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print("Your grade is:", grade)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
