## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each element in the original list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_numbers(nums):
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        result.append(num ** 2)
    return result

my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(square_numbers(my_numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
