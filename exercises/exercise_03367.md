## Exercise
Use a for loop to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])

    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(generate_fibonacci(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
