## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the cost of driving a car given the distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and fuel price.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_driving_cost(distance, fuel_efficiency, fuel_price):
    """
    Calculate the cost of driving a car given the distance traveled, 
    fuel efficiency, and fuel price.

    Args:
    distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.
    fuel_efficiency (float): The fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon.
    fuel_price (float): The price of fuel in dollars per gallon.

    Returns:
    float: The cost of driving the car for the given distance.
    """
    # Calculate the amount of fuel consumed
    fuel_consumed = distance / fuel_efficiency
    
    # Calculate the cost of driving
    driving_cost = fuel_consumed * fuel_price
    
    return driving_cost

def main():
    # Get user input
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in miles: "))
    fuel_efficiency = float(input("Enter the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon: "))
    fuel_price = float(input("Enter the price of fuel in dollars per gallon: "))

    # Calculate the driving cost
    driving_cost = calculate_driving_cost(distance, fuel_efficiency, fuel_price)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The cost of driving the car for {distance} miles is ${driving_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance traveled in miles: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpb6hh4a92.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpb6hh4a92.py", line 24, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in miles: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 25 2.50'
