## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the original string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string word;
    std::cout << "Enter a word: ";
    std::cin >> word;
    int len = word.length();
    std::string rev = "";

    for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        rev += word[i];
    }

    std::cout << "Reversed word: " << rev << std::endl;

    if (rev == word) {
        std::cout << "The word is a palindrome." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The word is not a palindrome." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
