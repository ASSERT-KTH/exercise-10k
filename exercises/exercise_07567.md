## Exercise
Create a function that uses the interpreter to evaluate a string as Python code.

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_string(code_str):
    """
    Evaluate a string as Python code.

    Args:
        code_str (str): A string containing Python code.

    Returns:
        The result of the evaluated code.
    """

    # First, we need to import the eval function from the builtins module.
    # However, in Python, eval is a built-in function, so we don't need to import it.
    
    # The eval function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.
    try:
        # We use the eval function to evaluate the string as Python code.
        # The eval function returns the result of the evaluated code.
        result = eval(code_str)
        
        # We return the result of the evaluated code.
        return result
    
    except Exception as e:
        # If an error occurs during the evaluation, we catch the exception and print the error message.
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        
        # We return None to indicate that an error occurred.
        return None

# Example usage:
print(evaluate_string("1 + 2"))  # Outputs: 3
print(evaluate_string("a = 5"))  # Outputs: None
print(evaluate_string("a"))  # Outputs: An error occurred: name 'a' is not defined
```

## Generated Output
```
3
An error occurred: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
None
An error occurred: name 'a' is not defined
None
```
