## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user. The user can choose to play again or quit after each game.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Return the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

def main():
    """Main program loop"""
    play_again = 'y'
    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose rock, computer chose rock.
It's a tie!

Do you want to play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmezcbu_x.py", line 37, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmezcbu_x.py", line 33, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
