## Exercise
Write a program that generates an arithmetic progression of a given length with a given common difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_arithmetic_progression(length, common_difference, start=0):
    """
    Generates an arithmetic progression of a given length with a given common difference.

    Args:
        length (int): The length of the arithmetic progression.
        common_difference (int): The common difference of the arithmetic progression.
        start (int, optional): The starting value of the arithmetic progression. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the arithmetic progression.
    """
    return [start + i * common_difference for i in range(length)]

# Example usage:
length = 10
common_difference = 2
start = 1

progression = generate_arithmetic_progression(length, common_difference, start)
print("Arithmetic Progression:")
print(progression)
```

## Generated Output
```
Arithmetic Progression:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
```
