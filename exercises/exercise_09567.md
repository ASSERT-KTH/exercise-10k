## Exercise
Create a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should have a specified number of rows, and each row should have a specified number of asterisks. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 3 asterisks per row, the program should print a pattern with 5 rows, each containing 3 asterisks. Use loops (for/while) to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_asterisk_pattern():
    """
    Prints a pattern of asterisks based on user input.
    """
    
    # Get the number of rows from the user
    num_rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
    
    # Get the number of asterisks per row from the user
    num_asterisks = int(input("Enter the number of asterisks per row: "))
    
    # Use a for loop to print each row
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Use a for loop to print each asterisk in the row
        for j in range(num_asterisks):
            print("*", end=" ")
        # Move to the next line after printing each row
        print()

# Call the function to start the program
print_asterisk_pattern()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzdo0n6fw.py", line 21, in <module>
    print_asterisk_pattern()
  File "/tmp/tmpzdo0n6fw.py", line 7, in print_asterisk_pattern
    num_rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5 3'
