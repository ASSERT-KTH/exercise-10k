## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), score >= 80 (B), score >= 70 (C), score >= 60 (D), score < 60 (F). Handle cases where the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

def grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    elif score < 60:
        return 'F'
    elif score < 0 or score > 100:
        return 'Bad score'

# Test the function
print(grade(59))  # Output: F
print(grade(60))  # Output: D
print(grade(61))  # Output: D
print(grade(70))  # Output: C
print(grade(80))  # Output: B
print(grade(90))  # Output: A
print(grade(100))  # Output: A
```

## Generated Output
```
