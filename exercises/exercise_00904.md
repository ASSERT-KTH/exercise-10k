## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a given variable is valid according to certain rules (e.g., it must be an integer between 1 and 100).

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_variable(var):
    """
    Checks if a given variable is a valid integer between 1 and 100.

    Args:
        var: The variable to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the variable is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we check if the variable is an integer
    if not isinstance(var, int):
        return False  # If it's not an integer, it's not valid

    # Next, we check if the integer is between 1 and 100
    if not 1 <= var <= 100:
        return False  # If it's not between 1 and 100, it's not valid

    # If the variable passes both checks, it's valid
    return True


# Example usage:
print(validate_variable(50))  # Should print: True
print(validate_variable(150))  # Should print: False
print(validate_variable("50"))  # Should print: False
```

## Generated Output
```
True
False
False
```
