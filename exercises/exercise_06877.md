## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Version: 1.0

# Define the voting age
voting_age = 18

# Get the user's name and store it in a variable
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Get the user's age and store it in a variable
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Print a personalized greeting message
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote
if age >= voting_age:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Add a blank line at the end of the output
print()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Hello, John Doe!
You are eligible to vote.
```
