## Exercise
Create a program to determine the type of a bank account based on the account balance. If the account balance is above $10000, it is a premium account. If the account balance is between $1000 and $10000, it is a standard account. If the account balance is below $1000, it is a basic account.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_account_type(balance):
    """
    Determine the type of a bank account based on the account balance.

    Args:
        balance (float): The account balance.

    Returns:
        str: The type of the bank account.
    """
    if balance > 10000:
        return "Premium"
    elif 1000 <= balance <= 10000:
        return "Standard"
    else:
        return "Basic"


# Example usage:
def main():
    balance = float(input("Enter the account balance: $"))
    account_type = determine_account_type(balance)
    print(f"The account type is: {account_type}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the account balance: $The account type is: Standard
```
