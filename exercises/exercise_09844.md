## Exercise
Create a function that takes in a list of authors and their corresponding book titles. The function should then return a dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles. If an author has no books, they should not be included in the dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def create_author_book_dict(authors_and_books):
    """
    This function takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an author's name and a list of their book titles.
    It returns a dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles.
    If an author has no books, they are not included in the dictionary.

    Args:
        authors_and_books (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains an author's name and a list of their book titles.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the authors and their books
    author_book_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each author and their books in the input list
    for author, books in authors_and_books:
        
        # Check if the author has any books
        if books:
            
            # If the author has books, add them to the dictionary
            # This will overwrite any existing entry for the author, but since we're not modifying existing books, this is fine
            author_book_dict[author] = books

    # Return the dictionary of authors and their books
    return author_book_dict


# Example usage:
authors_and_books = [
    ("Author1", ["Book1", "Book2"]),
    ("Author2", []),
    ("Author3", ["Book3", "Book4"]),
]

print(create_author_book_dict(authors_and_books))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'Author1': ['Book1', 'Book2'], 'Author3': ['Book3', 'Book4']}
```
