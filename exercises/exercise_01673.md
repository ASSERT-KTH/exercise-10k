## Exercise
Write a program that takes the income as input and calculates the total tax based on the following criteria: for the first 10000, the rate is 10%, for the next 20000, the rate is 15%, and for any additional income, the rate is 20% using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    float income, tax;

    std::cout << "Enter your income: ";
    std::cin >> income;

    if (income <= 10000) {
        tax = income * 0.1;
    } else if (income <= 30000) {
        tax = 1000 + ((income - 10000) * 0.15);
    } else {
        tax = 1000 + 3000 + ((income - 30000) * 0.2);
    }

    std::cout << "Total tax: " << tax << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
