## Exercise
Write a program that takes the distance traveled and time as input and outputs the speed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_speed(distance, time):
    """
    Calculate the speed of an object.

    Args:
        distance (float): Distance traveled in meters.
        time (float): Time taken in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: Speed in meters per second.
    """
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero.")
    speed = distance / time
    return speed

def main():
    # Get user input
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in meters: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time taken in seconds: "))

    try:
        # Calculate speed
        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)
        print(f"The speed is {speed} meters per second.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance traveled in meters: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqwl0iqz6.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqwl0iqz6.py", line 19, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in meters: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 2'
```
