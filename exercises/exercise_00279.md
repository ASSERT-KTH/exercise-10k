## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax amount and total cost of a product given its price and tax rate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculates the tax amount and total cost of a product.

    Args:
        price (float): The price of the product.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g. 8% = 0.08).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the tax amount and total cost.
    """
    tax_amount = price * tax_rate
    total_cost = price + tax_amount
    return tax_amount, total_cost

def main():
    # Example usage
    price = 100.0  # Price of the product
    tax_rate = 0.08  # Tax rate (8%)

    tax_amount, total_cost = calculate_tax(price, tax_rate)

    print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")
    print(f"Tax Rate: {tax_rate*100:.0f}%")
    print(f"Tax Amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
