## Exercise
Create a program that takes the amount of electricity consumed as input and calculates the total bill based on the following criteria: for the first 50 units, the rate is 0.50 per unit, for the next 100 units, the rate is 0.75 per unit, and for any additional units, the rate is 1.20 per unit using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_bill(units_consumed):
    """
    Calculate the total electricity bill based on the units consumed.

    The rates are as follows:
    - For the first 50 units, the rate is 0.50 per unit
    - For the next 100 units, the rate is 0.75 per unit
    - For any additional units, the rate is 1.20 per unit

    Args:
        units_consumed (float): The amount of electricity consumed in units.

    Returns:
        float: The total electricity bill.
    """

    # Check if units consumed is within valid range
    if units_consumed < 0:
        raise ValueError("Units consumed cannot be negative.")

    # Initialize the total bill
    total_bill = 0.0

    # Calculate the bill for the first 50 units
    if units_consumed > 50:
        total_bill += 50 * 0.50  # Rate is 0.50 per unit for the first 50 units
        remaining_units = units_consumed - 50
    else:
        total_bill += units_consumed * 0.50  # Rate is 0.50 per unit for the first 50 units
        remaining_units = 0

    # Calculate the bill for the next 100 units
    if remaining_units > 100:
        total_bill += 100 * 0.75  # Rate is 0.75 per unit for the next 100 units
        remaining_units -= 100
    else:
        total_bill += remaining_units * 0.75  # Rate is 0.75 per unit for the next 100 units
        remaining_units = 0

    # Calculate the bill for any additional units
    if remaining_units > 0:
        total_bill += remaining_units * 1.20  # Rate is 1.20 per unit for any additional units

    return total_bill


def main():
    # Take the amount of electricity consumed as input
    units_consumed = float(input("Enter the amount of electricity consumed in units: "))

    # Calculate and display the total bill
    total_bill = calculate_bill(units_consumed)
    print(f"Total Electricity Bill: ${total_bill:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount of electricity consumed in units: Total Electricity Bill: $77.50
```
