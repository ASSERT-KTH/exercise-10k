## Exercise
Write a program that asks for two strings and checks if the first string ends with the second string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_string_ending():
    """
    Asks for two strings and checks if the first string ends with the second string.
    """
    # Get the first string from the user
    str1 = input("Please enter the first string: ")

    # Get the second string from the user
    str2 = input("Please enter the second string: ")

    # Check if the first string ends with the second string
    if str1.endswith(str2):
        print(f"'{str1}' ends with '{str2}'")
    else:
        print(f"'{str1}' does not end with '{str2}'")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_string_ending()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the first string: Please enter the second string: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpysgi28dz.py", line 19, in <module>
    check_string_ending()
  File "/tmp/tmpysgi28dz.py", line 9, in check_string_ending
    str2 = input("Please enter the second string: ")
