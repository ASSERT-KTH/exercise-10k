## Exercise
Write a program that greets the user based on the time of day. If the time is between 6am and 12pm, print 'Good morning', between 12pm and 5pm print 'Good afternoon', otherwise print 'Good evening'. Assume the user inputs the time in 24-hour format.

## Reference Solution
```python
def greet_user(time):
    """
    Greets the user based on the time of day.

    Args:
        time (int): Time in 24-hour format.

    Returns:
        str: Greeting message.
    """
    if 6 <= time <= 12:  # 6am to 12pm
        return 'Good morning'
    elif 12 < time <= 17:  # 12pm to 5pm
        return 'Good afternoon'
    else:  # Otherwise
        return 'Good evening'

def main():
    # Get user input
    time = int(input("Enter the time in 24-hour format (HH): "))

    # Validate user input
    if not 0 <= time <= 23:
        print("Invalid time. Please enter a time between 0 and 23.")
    else:
        # Print greeting message
        print(greet_user(time))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
