## Exercise
Given an array of stock prices, find the maximum possible profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock at most twice. The function should take in an array of stock prices as input and return the maximum possible profit.

## Reference Solution
```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    buy1 = buy2 = float('-inf')
    sell1 = sell2 = 0
    for price in prices:
        buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
        sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)
        buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)
        sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)
    return sell2

# Example usage
prices = [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]
print(maxProfit(prices))  # Output: 6
```

## Generated Output
```
6
