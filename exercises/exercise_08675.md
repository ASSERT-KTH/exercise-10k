## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and uses them to fill in the blanks in a story.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for noun, verb, and adjective."""
    noun = input("Enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
    adjective = input("Enter an adjective: ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

def tell_story(noun, verb, adjective):
    """Tell a story with the given words."""
    story = f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. " \
            f"Suddenly, it started to {verb} and {verb} and {verb} some more. " \
            f"The {noun} was so happy that it {verb} all the way home."
    return story

def main():
    """Main function."""
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    story = tell_story(noun, verb, adjective)
    print("Here is your story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a noun: Enter a verb: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwawz5pj2.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwawz5pj2.py", line 17, in main
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpwawz5pj2.py", line 4, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
