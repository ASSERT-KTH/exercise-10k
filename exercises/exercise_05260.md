## Exercise
Write a program to generate a sequence of numbers based on a given formula or pattern.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sequence_generator(formula, n):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.

    Args:
        formula (str): A string representing the formula to generate the sequence.
                       The formula should be in the format of a Python expression,
                       where 'n' represents the term number.
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers representing the generated sequence.
    """
    sequence = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Replace 'n' in the formula with the current term number
        term = eval(formula.replace('n', str(i)))
        sequence.append(term)
    return sequence

def main():
    print("Sequence Generator Program")
    print("---------------------------")

    # Get the formula from the user
    formula = input("Enter the formula (e.g., 'n**2', '2*n', etc.): ")

    # Get the number of terms from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    # Generate the sequence
    sequence = sequence_generator(formula, n)

    # Print the generated sequence
    print("Generated Sequence:")
    print(sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Sequence Generator Program
---------------------------
Enter the formula (e.g., 'n**2', '2*n', etc.): Enter the number of terms: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp836113ud.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp836113ud.py", line 29, in main
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
