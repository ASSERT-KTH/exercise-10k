## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring(string, substring):
    """
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.
    
    Args:
    string (str): The input string.
    substring (str): The substring to search for.
    
    Returns:
    int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    """
    return string.find(substring)

# Example usage:
string = "Hello, World!"
substring = "World"
index = find_substring(string, substring)
if index != -1:
    print(f"The substring '{substring}' is found at index {index}.")
else:
    print(f"The substring '{substring}' is not found in the string.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The substring 'World' is found at index 7.
```
