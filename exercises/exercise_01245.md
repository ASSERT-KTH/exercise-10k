## Exercise
Write a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and applies it to a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_to_list(func, numbers):
    """
    Applies a given function to a list of numbers.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to apply to the list of numbers.
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to apply the function to.

    Returns:
        list: A list of results after applying the function to each number.
    """
    return [func(num) for num in numbers]

# Example usage:
def square(x):
    """Returns the square of a number."""
    return x ** 2

def double(x):
    """Returns the double of a number."""
    return x * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_numbers = apply_to_list(square, numbers)
print("Squared numbers:", squared_numbers)

doubled_numbers = apply_to_list(double, numbers)
print("Doubled numbers:", doubled_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Doubled numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
