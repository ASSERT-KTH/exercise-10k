## Exercise
Write a program that takes in an age and outputs the corresponding age group using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def classify_age(age):
    """
    Classify age into different groups.

    Args:
        age (int): The age to be classified.

    Returns:
        str: The age group.
    """
    if age < 0:
        return "Invalid age"
    elif age <= 12:
        return "Child"
    elif age <= 19:
        return "Teenager"
    elif age <= 64:
        return "Adult"
    else:
        return "Senior Citizen"

def main():
    # Get user input
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

    # Classify age
    age_group = classify_age(age)

    # Print result
    print(f"Your age group is: {age_group}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your age: Your age group is: Adult
```
