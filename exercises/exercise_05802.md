## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while guess != number_to_guess:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        
        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        if not guess.isdigit():
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Convert the input to an integer
        guess = int(guess)
        
        # Check if the guess is in the correct range
        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the attempt counter
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number to guess
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
    
    # Print a success message
    print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too high! Try again.
Take a guess:

    guess = input("Take a guess: ")
