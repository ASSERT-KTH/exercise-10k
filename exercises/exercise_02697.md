## Exercise
Write a program that takes a person's income as input and calculates their tax based on the following conditions: the tax rate is 10% for incomes below $10,000, 20% for incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, and 30% for incomes above $20,000.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Variables
income = 0
taxRate = 0
tax = 0

# Get user input
income = int(input("Enter your income: "))

# Determine tax rate
if income < 10000:
    taxRate = 0.1
elif income < 20000:
    taxRate = 0.2
else:
    taxRate = 0.3

# Calculate tax
tax = income * taxRate

# Print results
print("Your income is: $", income)
print("Your tax rate is: ", taxRate)
print("Your tax is: $", tax)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: Your income is: $ 15000
Your tax rate is:  0.2
Your tax is: $ 3000.0
```
