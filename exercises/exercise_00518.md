## Exercise
Given two arrays of integers, write a program to merge them into a single array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Merge two arrays of integers into a single array.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array of integers.
        arr2 (list): The second array of integers.

    Returns:
        list: The merged array of integers.
    """
    return arr1 + arr2

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

merged_array = merge_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(merged_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

```python
def merge_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)

# Example usage:
arr1 = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
arr2 = [6, 7, 3, 4, 10]

merged_array = merge_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(merged_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
