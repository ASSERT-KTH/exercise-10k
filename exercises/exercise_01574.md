## Exercise
Create a function that uses a lambda function to filter a list of numbers and return the numbers greater than a given threshold.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(threshold, numbers):
    """
    This function filters a list of numbers and returns the numbers greater than a given threshold.

    Args:
        threshold (int): The threshold value to filter numbers.
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be filtered.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers greater than the threshold.
    """

    # First, we define the function with two parameters: threshold and numbers.
    
    # We use the built-in filter() function in Python, which constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.
    # The filter() function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable.
    # We use a lambda function as the first argument, which is a small anonymous function that takes one argument and returns True if the number is greater than the threshold, and False otherwise.
    filtered_numbers = filter(lambda x: x > threshold, numbers)
    
    # The filter() function returns an iterator, so we need to convert it to a list using the list() function.
    # This is because the problem statement asks for a list as output.
    result = list(filtered_numbers)
    
    # Finally, we return the list of numbers greater than the threshold.
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
threshold = 5
print(filter_numbers(threshold, numbers))  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Generated Output
```
[6, 7, 8, 9]
```
