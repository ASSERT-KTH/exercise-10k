## Exercise
Write a program that takes the total cost of a meal as input and calculates the tip based on the following conditions: the tip is 15% of the total cost for good service, 20% for excellent service, and 10% for poor service.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the tip
def calculateTip(totalCost, service):
    if service == "good":
        tip = totalCost * 0.15
    elif service == "fair":
        tip = totalCost * 0.20
    elif service == "bad":
        tip = totalCost * 0.10
    else:
        return "Invalid service rating"
    return tip

# Define a function to convert a string to title case
def convertToTitleCase(word):
    return word.title()

# Main program
totalCost = float(input("Enter the total cost of the meal: "))
service = input("Enter the service rating (good, fair, or bad): ")
service = convertToTitleCase(service)

# Calculate and display the tip
tip = calculateTip(totalCost, service)
print(f"Tip: ${tip:.2f}")
print(f"Total amount to pay: ${totalCost + tip:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total cost of the meal: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd_y0h_o4.py", line 18, in <module>
    totalCost = float(input("Enter the total cost of the meal: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100, good'
```
