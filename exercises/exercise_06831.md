## Exercise
Create a program that calculates an employee's net salary based on their gross salary and tax bracket. The tax brackets are as follows: 10% for gross salaries up to $10,000, 20% for gross salaries between $10,001 and $20,000, and 30% for gross salaries above $20,000. Use conditional statements to determine the tax bracket and calculate the net salary.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the gross_salary variable
gross_salary = 40000

# Define the tax rates and brackets
tax_rate = 0.10
if gross_salary > 10000:
    tax_rate = 0.20
if gross_salary > 20000:
    tax_rate = 0.30

# Calculate the tax_amount
tax_amount = gross_salary * tax_rate

# Calculate the net_salary
net_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount

# Print the results
print("Gross Salary: ", gross_salary)
print("Tax Amount: ", tax_amount)
print("Net Salary: ", net_salary)
```

## Generated Output
```
Gross Salary:  40000
Tax Amount:  12000.0
Net Salary:  28000.0
```
