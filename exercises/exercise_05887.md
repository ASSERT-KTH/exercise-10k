## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a function as input and returns a new list containing the results of applying the function to each element of the original list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function_to_list(input_list, func):
    """
    This function takes a list and a function as input, applies the function to each element of the list, 
    and returns a new list containing the results.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list of elements to be processed.
        func (function): The function to be applied to each element of the list.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the results of applying the function to each element of the original list.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of applying the function to each element of the input list.
    result_list = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input list.
    for element in input_list:
        # Apply the function to the current element and store the result in a variable.
        result = func(element)
        
        # Append the result to the result list.
        result_list.append(result)

    # Return the result list after all elements have been processed.
    return result_list

# Example usage:
# Define a simple function that squares a number.
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Create a list of numbers.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the square function to each number in the list and print the results.
print(apply_function_to_list(numbers, square))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
