## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the discount on a product based on its price. If the price is above 100, the discount is 10%. If the price is between 50 and 100, the discount is 5%. If the price is below 50, the discount is 0%.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int price;

    std::cout << "Enter the price: ";
    std::cin >> price;

    double discount = 0;
    double discountPrice = 0;
    double savedAmount = 0;

    if (price > 100) {
        discount = (price * 10) / 100.0;
    } else if (price > 50) {
        discount = (price * 5) / 100.0;
    }

    discountPrice = price - discount;
    savedAmount = discount;

    std::cout << "Original price: " << price << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Discount: " << discount << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Discount price: " << discountPrice << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Amount saved: " << savedAmount << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
