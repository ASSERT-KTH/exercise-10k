## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of their squares

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list.
        ValueError: If the list contains non-numeric values.
    """
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    try:
        return sum([n ** 2 for n in numbers])
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError("List must contain only numeric values")

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 55
```

## Generated Output
```
55
```
