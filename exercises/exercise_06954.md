## Exercise
Create a function that takes the length and width of a rectangle as arguments and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    """
    This function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input values are valid. 
    # We assume that the length and width should be non-negative numbers.
    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Length and width must be numbers.")
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width cannot be negative.")

    # Now, we can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width.
    # This is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.
    area = length * width

    # Finally, we return the calculated area.
    return area
```
