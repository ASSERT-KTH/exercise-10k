## Exercise
Write a program that declares a tuple variable and prints its elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a tuple variable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the tuple
print("My Tuple: ", my_tuple)

# Print each element of the tuple
for i in range(len(my_tuple)):
    print("Element at index", i, "is:", my_tuple[i])
```

```python
# Declare a tuple variable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the tuple
print("My Tuple: ", my_tuple)

# Print each element of the tuple
for element in my_tuple:
    print("Element:", element)
```

```python
# Declare a tuple variable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the tuple
print("My Tuple: ", my_tuple)

# Print each element of the tuple
for index, element in enumerate(my_tuple):
    print("Element at index", index, "is:", element)
```

## Generated Output
```
My Tuple:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Element at index 0 is: 1
Element at index 1 is: 2
Element at index 2 is: 3
Element at index 3 is: 4
Element at index 4 is: 5
```
