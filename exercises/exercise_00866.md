## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a number and outputs the next number in the sequence based on the following conditions: if the number is even, the next number is the current number divided by 2, if the number is odd, the next number is the current number multiplied by 3 and added 1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def next_collatz_number(n):
    """
    Generates the next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): The current number in the sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The next number in the sequence.
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # If the number is even, divide by 2
        return n // 2
    else:
        # If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
        return n * 3 + 1

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    next_num = next_collatz_number(num)
    print("The next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence is:", next_num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence is: 3
```
