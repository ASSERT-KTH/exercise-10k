## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the tax given the income and tax rate.

```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount given the income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income amount.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax amount.
    """
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount


def main():
    # Get user input
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.25 for 25%): "))

    # Calculate and display the tax amount
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)
    print(f"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Net income: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
