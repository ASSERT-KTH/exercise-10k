## Exercise
Create a program that displays a weather forecast based on the temperature using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def display_weather_forecast(temperature):
    """
    Displays a weather forecast based on the temperature.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
    """
    if temperature < 0:
        print("It's freezing! Wear warm clothing and stay indoors.")
    elif 0 <= temperature < 10:
        print("It's cold. Wear a jacket and gloves to stay warm.")
    elif 10 <= temperature < 20:
        print("It's mild. Perfect weather for outdoor activities.")
    elif 20 <= temperature < 30:
        print("It's warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen and stay hydrated.")
    else:
        print("It's hot! Stay indoors during the hottest part of the day and drink plenty of water.")

def main():
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    display_weather_forecast(temperature)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
