## Exercise
Find the mode age of students in a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_mode_age(students):
    """
    Find the mode age of students in a dictionary.

    Args:
        students (dict): Dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.

    Returns:
        int or list: The mode age(s) of students.
    """
    # Extract ages from the dictionary
    ages = list(students.values())

    # Count the frequency of each age
    age_counts = Counter(ages)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_count = max(age_counts.values())

    # Find all ages with the maximum frequency
    mode_ages = [age for age, count in age_counts.items() if count == max_count]

    return mode_ages

# Example usage:
students = {
    "John": 20,
    "Alice": 22,
    "Bob": 20,
    "Charlie": 20,
    "David": 22
}

mode_ages = find_mode_age(students)
print("Mode age(s):", mode_ages)
```

## Generated Output
```
Mode age(s): [20]
```
