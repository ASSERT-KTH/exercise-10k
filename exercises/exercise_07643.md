## Exercise
Create a function to check if a given number is a prime number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a prime number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"Is {num} a prime number? {is_prime(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 2 a prime number? True
Is 3 a prime number? True
Is 4 a prime number? False
Is 5 a prime number? True
Is 6 a prime number? False
Is 7 a prime number? True
Is 8 a prime number? False
Is 9 a prime number? False
