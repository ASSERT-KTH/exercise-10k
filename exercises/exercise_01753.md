## Exercise
Given a list of integers, write a program to partition it into two sublists based on a specific condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_list(numbers, condition):
    """
    Partition a list of integers into two sublists based on a specific condition.

    Args:
    - numbers (list): The list of integers to be partitioned.
    - condition (function): A function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the numbers that satisfy the condition, and the second list contains the numbers that do not satisfy the condition.
    """
    satisfied = [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]
    not_satisfied = [num for num in numbers if not condition(num)]
    return satisfied, not_satisfied

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

def is_even(num):
    """Check if a number is even."""
    return num % 2 == 0

even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, is_even)

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
