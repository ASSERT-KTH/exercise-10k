## Exercise
Create a program that tells jokes with user-inputted names and locations.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to tell a joke
def tell_joke(name, location):
    # Define a list of joke templates
    joke_templates = [
        f"Why did {name} go to {location}? Because they heard the Wi-Fi was great!",
        f"I told {name} to meet me at {location}, but they're always running late!",
        f"{name} went to {location} and found a {random.choice(['million-dollar bill', 'magic wand', 'unicorn'])}!",
        f"What did {name} say when they arrived at {location}? 'I'm finally here!'",
        f"{name} is going to {location} to learn how to {random.choice(['surf', 'ski', 'dance'])}!"
    ]

    # Select a random joke template and print it
    print(random.choice(joke_templates))

# Main function
def main():
    # Ask the user for their name and a location
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    location = input("Please enter a location: ")

    # Tell a joke with the user's input
    tell_joke(name, location)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter a location: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpb4klfflw.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpb4klfflw.py", line 22, in main
    location = input("Please enter a location: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
