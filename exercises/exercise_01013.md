## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the longest repeated substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_repeated_substring(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    end_pos = 0
    
    # Create a 2D array for dynamic programming
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == s[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                if dp[i][j] > max_len:
                    max_len = dp[i][j]
                    end_pos = j
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0
    
    return s[end_pos - max_len: end_pos]

# Example usage:
s = "abcabcbb"
print("Longest repeated substring:", longest_repeated_substring(s))
```

## Generated Output
```
Longest repeated substring: abc
```
