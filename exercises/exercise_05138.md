## Exercise
Write a program to find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
    
    Args:
    s (str): The string to search for the minimum window.
    t (str): The string containing the characters to search for.
    
    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. If no such window exists, returns an empty string.
    """
    
    # Base case: If `t` is longer than `s`, return an empty string
    if len(t) > len(s):
        return ""
    
    # Create a counter for the characters in `t`
    t_count = Counter(t)
    
    # Initialize the required character count to the length of `t`
    required = len(t_count)
    
    # Initialize the left and right pointers
    left = 0
    
    # Initialize the minimum window substring and its length
    min_window = ""
    min_window_len = float('inf')
    
    # Initialize the formed character count to 0
    formed = 0
    
    # Create a counter for the characters in the window
    window_counts = {}
    
    # Iterate over the string `s` with the right pointer
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add the character at the right pointer to the window counts
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1
        
        # If the character is in `t` and its count in the window is equal to its count in `t`, increment the formed count
        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed += 1
        
        # While the window contains all characters of `t` and the left pointer is less than the right pointer
        while left <= right and formed == required:
            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_window_len:
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]
                min_window_len = right - left + 1
            
            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counts
            character = s[left]
            window_counts[character] -= 1
            
            # If the character is in `t` and its count in the window is less than its count in `t`, decrement the formed count
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed -= 1
            
            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1
    
    # Return the minimum window substring
    return min_window

# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
