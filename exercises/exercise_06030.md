## Exercise
Write a closure function that returns another function with access to its own scope. Use the function to create a counter that increments each time it is called.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a closure function that returns another function with access to its own scope.
def create_counter():
    """
    Creates a counter that increments each time it is called.
    
    Returns:
        function: A function that returns the current count and increments it.
    """
    # Initialize the counter variable in the outer function's scope.
    count = 0
    
    # Define the inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.
    def increment():
        nonlocal count  # Use the nonlocal keyword to indicate that we want to modify the outer function's variable.
        result = count  # Store the current count in a local variable.
        count += 1  # Increment the counter.
        return result  # Return the current count.
    
    # Return the inner function, which has access to the outer function's scope.
    return increment

# Create a counter by calling the create_counter function.
counter = create_counter()

# Test the counter by calling it multiple times and printing the result.
print(counter())  # Output: 0
print(counter())  # Output: 1
print(counter())  # Output: 2
```

## Generated Output
```
0
1
2
```
