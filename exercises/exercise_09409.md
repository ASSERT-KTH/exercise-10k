## Exercise
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
num_terms = 10
print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:")
print(fibonacci(num_terms))
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
