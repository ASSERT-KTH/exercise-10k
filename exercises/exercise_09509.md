## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The program should then print the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input, performs addition, subtraction, 
    multiplication, and division operations, and prints the results.
    
    Parameters:
    num1 (float): The first number.
    num2 (float): The second number.
    """
    # Check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero error
    if num2 == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        # Perform addition
        addition_result = num1 + num2
        print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}")

        # Perform subtraction
        subtraction_result = num1 - num2
        print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}")

        # Perform multiplication
        multiplication_result = num1 * num2
        print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}")

        # Perform division
        division_result = num1 / num2
        print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}")

# Take two numbers as input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Call the function to perform arithmetic operations
perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpngkcen6v.py", line 32, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 2'
```
