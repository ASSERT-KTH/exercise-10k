## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the standard deviation.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the input list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the variance
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the standard deviation
    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    return standard_deviation

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
print(f"The standard deviation is: {std_dev}")
```

```python
import statistics

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the input list.

    Raises:
        StatisticsError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    return statistics.stdev(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
print(f"The standard deviation is: {std_dev}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The standard deviation is: 1.4142135623730951
```
