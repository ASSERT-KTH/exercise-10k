## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and an element as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the element in the list. If the element is not found, return -1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def last_occurrence(lst, elem):
    """
    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of an element in a list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to search in.
        elem: The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the last occurrence of the element. Returns -1 if the element is not found.
    """

    # Reverse the list to start searching from the end
    reversed_lst = lst[::-1]
    
    # Try to find the index of the element in the reversed list
    try:
        # The index method returns the index of the first occurrence of the element
        # Since we're searching in a reversed list, this will give us the index of the last occurrence in the original list
        idx = reversed_lst.index(elem)
        
        # Since we're working with a reversed list, we need to subtract the index from the length of the list minus one
        # This will give us the correct index in the original list
        idx = len(lst) - 1 - idx
        
        # Return the index
        return idx
    
    # If the element is not found, the index method will raise a ValueError
    except ValueError:
        # In this case, we return -1 as specified in the problem
        return -1
```
