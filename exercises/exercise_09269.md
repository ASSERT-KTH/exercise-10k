## Exercise
Write a program that finds the longest common subsequence of two input strings. The longest common subsequence is the longest sequence of characters that appears in the same order in both strings, but it may not be contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'abcdef' and 'zbcdfg' is 'bcdf'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
    """
    Find the longest common subsequence of two input strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first input string.
        str2 (str): The second input string.

    Returns:
        str: The longest common subsequence of str1 and str2.
    """
    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Build the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Reconstruct the LCS from the dynamic programming table
    lcs = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    # Return the LCS in the correct order
    return "".join(reversed(lcs))

# Example usage:
str1 = "abcdef"
str2 = "zbcdfg"
lcs = longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2)
print(f"The longest common subsequence of '{str1}' and '{str2}' is '{lcs}'")
```

## Generated Output
```
The longest common subsequence of 'abcdef' and 'zbcdfg' is 'bcdf'
```
