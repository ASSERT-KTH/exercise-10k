## Exercise
Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.
        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from both input arrays.
    """
    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)


def merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array efficiently.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.
        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from both input arrays.
    """
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    # Merge smaller elements first
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            result.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1

    # If there are remaining elements in arr1, append them to the result
    while i < len(arr1):
        result.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1

    # If there are remaining elements in arr2, append them to the result
    while j < len(arr2):
        result.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1

    return result


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]

    print("Merging using built-in sort:")
    print(merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))

    print("\nMerging efficiently:")
    print(merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Merging using built-in sort:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Merging efficiently:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
