## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and prints out a Mad Libs story using those words

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input
def get_user_input():
    """
    Asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective.
    """
    noun = input("Please enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Please enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): ")
    adjective = input("Please enter an adjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

# Define a function to generate the Mad Libs story
def generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective):
    """
    Generates a Mad Libs story using the provided words.
    """
    story_templates = [
        f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. "
        f"Suddenly, it started to {verb} and ran away.",
        f"I saw a {adjective} {noun} in the park. It was {verb} around and having fun.",
        f"The {adjective} {noun} was feeling very {adjective} and decided to {verb} through the fields."
    ]
    return random.choice(story_templates)

# Main function
def main():
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    story = generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective)
    print("\nHere is your Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a noun: Please enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppo1reaod.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmppo1reaod.py", line 29, in main
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmppo1reaod.py", line 10, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Please enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
