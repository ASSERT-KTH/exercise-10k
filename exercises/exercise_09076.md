## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a simple game show and asks the user a series of questions using if statements to determine the winner

## Reference Solution
```python
# Game Show Simulator

# Initialize score and question counter
score = 0
question_counter = 1

# Question 1
print(f"Question {question_counter}: What is the capital of France?")
answer1 = input("Enter your answer: ")
if answer1.lower() == "paris":
    score += 1
    print("Correct!\n")
else:
    print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Paris.\n")
question_counter += 1

# Question 2
print(f"Question {question_counter}: Which planet is the largest in our solar system?")
answer2 = input("Enter your answer: ")
if answer2.lower() == "jupiter":
    score += 1
    print("Correct!\n")
else:
    print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Jupiter.\n")
question_counter += 1

# Question 3
print(f"Question {question_counter}: Who painted the famous painting 'The Starry Night'?")
answer3 = input("Enter your answer: ")
if answer3.lower() == "vincent van gogh":
    score += 1
    print("Correct!\n")
else:
    print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Vincent Van Gogh.\n")
question_counter += 1

# Determine the winner
if score >= 2:
    print(f"Congratulations! You won with a score of {score} out of 3.")
else:
    print(f"Sorry, you lost with a score of {score} out of 3. Better luck next time!")
```

## Generated Output
```
Question 1: What is the capital of France?
Enter your answer: Incorrect. The correct answer is Paris.

Question 2: Which planet is the largest in our solar system?
Enter your answer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcxhlwbg7.py", line 19, in <module>
    answer2 = input("Enter your answer: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
