## Exercise
Write a program that determines the weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity. If the temperature is above 25°C and the humidity is above 60%, the forecast is 'Rain'. If the temperature is below 15°C and the humidity is below 40%, the forecast is 'Sunny'. If the temperature and humidity are between these ranges, the forecast is 'Cloudy'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Libraries
import sys

# Defining Variables
temperature = 20
humidity = 80

# Defining the Function
def forecast(temperature, humidity):
    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:
        return 'Rain'
    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 40:
        return 'Sunny'
    else:
        return 'Cloudy'

# Calling the Function
f = forecast(temperature, humidity)

# Printing the Result
print(f)
```

## Generated Output
```
Cloudy
```
