## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.
    """
    return sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1))


def main():
    # Example usage:
    n = 5
    result = sum_of_squares(n)
    print(f"The sum of squares from 1 to {n} is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def sum_of_squares_formula(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n using the formula.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.
    """
    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6


def main():
    # Example usage:
    n = 5
    result = sum_of_squares_formula(n)
    print(f"The sum of squares from 1 to {n} is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of squares from 1 to 5 is: 55
```
