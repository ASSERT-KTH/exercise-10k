## Exercise
Create a program that processes student data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary contains student names as keys and their respective grades as values. The program should calculate the average grade, find the student with the highest grade, and print out all students with grades above the average.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the dictionary
student_data = {
    'John': 80,
    'Emily': 90,
    'Michael': 70,
    'Sarah': 85,
    'William': 95,
    'Olivia': 75,
    'David': 65,
    'Ava': 85,
    'Joseph': 70,
    'Isabella': 90,
    'James': 80,
    'Sophia': 85,
    'Robert': 75,
    'Mia': 90,
    'Richard': 70,
    'Charlotte': 85
}

# Calculate the average grade
average_grade = sum(student_data.values()) / len(student_data)
print(f'Average grade: {average_grade}')

# Find the student with the highest grade
highest_grade = max(student_data.values())
print(f'Highest grade: {highest_grade}')

# Find the student with the highest grade
highest_grade_student = [name for name, grade in student_data.items() if grade == highest_grade]
print(f'Student(s) with the highest grade: {highest_grade_student}')

# Find students with grades above the average
above_average_students = {name: grade for name, grade in student_data.items() if grade > average_grade}
print(f'Students with grades above the average: {above_average_students}')
```

## Generated Output
```
Average grade: 80.625
Highest grade: 95
Student(s) with the highest grade: ['William']
Students with grades above the average: {'Emily': 90, 'Sarah': 85, 'William': 95, 'Ava': 85, 'Isabella': 90, 'Sophia': 85, 'Mia': 90, 'Charlotte': 85}
```
