## Exercise
Create a function that measures the execution time of another function.

## Reference Solution
```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def measure_execution_time(func):
    """
    A decorator function to measure the execution time of another function.

    Args:
        func: The target function to be measured.

    Returns:
        A wrapped function that includes the execution time measurement.
    """
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        execution_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage:
@measure_execution_time
def example_function():
    """
    An example function that simulates a time-consuming operation.
    """
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation

example_function()
```

## Generated Output
```
Function 'example_function' executed in 1.0010 seconds.
```
