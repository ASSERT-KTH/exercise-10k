## Exercise
Declare two variables and compare them using different comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==).

## Reference Solution
```python
let a = 5;
let b = 5;

console.log(a == b);  // Output: True
console.log(a != b);  // Output: False

// JavaScript does not have a separate operator for "equals" like some other languages (e.g., === and .equals() in Java)
// However, it does have the "===' operator which checks for both value and type equality
console.log(a === b);  // Output: True
console.log(a !== b);  // Output: False
```
