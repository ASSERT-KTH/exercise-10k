## Exercise
Write a program that takes in the hour and minute and outputs the time in 12-hour format based on the following conditions: if the hour is 0, output '12:', if the hour is between 1 and 11, output the hour, if the hour is between 12 and 23, output the hour minus 12.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int hour, minute;

    cin >> hour >> minute;

    if (hour == 0) {
        cout << "12:" << minute << " AM" << endl;
    } else if (hour >= 1 && hour <= 11) {
        cout << hour << ":" << minute << " AM" << endl;
    } else if (hour >= 12 && hour <= 23) {
        cout << hour - 12 << ":" << minute << " PM" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
