## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    """

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.
    """
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
