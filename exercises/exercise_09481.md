## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should take an integer score as input and output the corresponding grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    # Check the score and return the corresponding grade
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

# Main program
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
grade = calculate_grade(score)
print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
