## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade. The grade is determined by the following rules: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, print 'Invalid score'. Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Read the score from the user
score = int(input("Enter the score: "))

# Use conditional statements to determine the grade
if (score <= 100) and (score >= 90):
    print("Grade is A")
elif (score < 90) and (score >= 80):
    print("Grade is B")
elif (score < 80) and (score >= 70):
    print("Grade is C")
elif (score < 70) and (score >= 60):
    print("Grade is D")
elif (score < 60) and (score >= 0):
    print("Grade is F")
else:
    print("Invalid score")

# Note: This code can be improved by using more concise conditional statements
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score: Grade is B
```
