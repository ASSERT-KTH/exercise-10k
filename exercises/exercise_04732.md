## Exercise
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. The function should handle the case where the input is not a number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_number(num):
    """
    This function takes a number as an argument and returns its square.
    If the input is not a number, it raises a TypeError.

    Args:
        num (int or float): The number to be squared.

    Returns:
        int or float: The square of the input number.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a number.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is not a number
    # We use isinstance to check if the input is either an integer or a float
    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
        # If the input is not a number, we raise a TypeError with a descriptive message
        raise TypeError("Input must be a number")

    # If the input is a number, we calculate its square using the ** operator
    # The ** operator in Python is used for exponentiation
    # In this case, we use ** 2 to calculate the square of the number
    squared_num = num ** 2

    # Finally, we return the squared number
    return squared_num
```
