## Exercise
Create two functions, one that doubles a number and another that triples a number, and use them to create a new function that sextuples a number

## Reference Solution
```python
def double(n):
    """
    Doubles a given number.

    Args:
        n (int or float): The number to double.

    Returns:
        int or float: The doubled number.
    """
    return n * 2


def triple(n):
    """
    Triples a given number.

    Args:
        n (int or float): The number to triple.

    Returns:
        int or float: The tripled number.
    """
    return n * 3


def sextuple(n):
    """
    Sextuples a given number by tripling it and then doubling the result.

    Args:
        n (int or float): The number to sextuple.

    Returns:
        int or float: The sextupled number.
    """
    # First, triple the number
    tripled = triple(n)
    # Then, double the tripled number
    sextupled = double(tripled)
    return sextupled


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number = 5
    print(f"Sextupling {number} gives: {sextuple(number)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sextupling 5 gives: 30
```
