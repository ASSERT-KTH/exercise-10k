## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a grouping function as input, groups the list into sublists based on the grouping function, and returns the grouped list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def group_list(input_list, grouping_function):
    """
    This function groups a list into sublists based on a given grouping function.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be grouped.
        grouping_function (function): A function that takes an element and returns a key for grouping.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each key is a group and each value is a list of elements in that group.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped lists
    grouped_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # Calculate the group key for the current element using the grouping function
        group_key = grouping_function(element)

        # If the group key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value
        if group_key not in grouped_dict:
            # This is a new group, so create a new list for it
            grouped_dict[group_key] = []

        # Add the current element to its corresponding group in the dictionary
        grouped_dict[group_key].append(element)

    # Return the dictionary of grouped lists
    return grouped_dict


# Example usage:
# Define a grouping function that groups numbers by their parity
def parity_grouping_function(num):
    return "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd"

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Group the list using the parity grouping function
grouped_numbers = group_list(numbers, parity_grouping_function)

# Print the grouped list
print(grouped_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'odd': [1, 3, 5], 'even': [2, 4, 6]}
```
