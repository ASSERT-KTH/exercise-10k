## Exercise
Write a program that takes two floating-point inputs from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations, and prints the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get input from user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
product_result = num1 * num2

# Print results
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum_result)
print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is", product_result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqq_i5kjl.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '3.5, 2.7'
```
