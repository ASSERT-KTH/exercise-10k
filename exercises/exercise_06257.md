## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and splits it into two dictionaries, one with even keys and one with odd keys

## Reference Solution
```python
def split_dict(input_dict):
    """
    Splits a dictionary into two dictionaries, one with even keys and one with odd keys.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary to be split.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains even keys, 
               and the second dictionary contains odd keys.
    """
    even_dict = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if isinstance(key, int) and key % 2 == 0}
    odd_dict = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if isinstance(key, int) and key % 2 != 0}

    return even_dict, odd_dict

# Example usage
def main():
    input_dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e', 6: 'f'}
    even_dict, odd_dict = split_dict(input_dict)

    print("Even Dictionary:")
    print(even_dict)
    print("\nOdd Dictionary:")
    print(odd_dict)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Even Dictionary:
{2: 'b', 4: 'd', 6: 'f'}

Odd Dictionary:
{1: 'a', 3: 'c', 5: 'e'}
```
