## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate the difference between let, const, and var.

## Reference Solution
```python
// Python does not have a direct equivalent of 'let' and 'const' like JavaScript.
// However, we can use the 'var' keyword to demonstrate the difference.

// 'var' is the most common keyword used to declare a variable in JavaScript.
// However, in Python, we don't need to use any keyword to declare a variable.

// Using 'var' (or no keyword in Python) allows the variable to be reassigned.
var x = 5;
x = 10;
console.log(x);  // prints 10

// Python has no direct equivalent of 'const' either, but we can use the 'final' type hint in Python 3.8+ to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned.
// However, this is only a hint and does not prevent reassignment.

// 'const' in JavaScript is used to declare a constant, which cannot be reassigned.
// In Python, we can use the 'final' type hint to achieve similar behavior.
// Note: This is only a hint and does not prevent reassignment.
const y = 5;
try {
    y = 10;
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Assignment to constant variable.");
}

// 'let' in JavaScript is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block it is declared in.
// In Python, variables are scoped to the nearest enclosing function or class.
// We can demonstrate this using a for loop.

// Using 'let' (or no keyword in Python) in a for loop means the variable is only accessible within the loop.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
try {
    console.log(i);
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Variable 'i' is not defined.");
}
```
