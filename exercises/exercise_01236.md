## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to play a game of rock paper scissors against the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "User"
    else:
        return "Computer"

def main():
    play_again = "y"
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
        
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
        
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == "Tie":
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        else:
            print(f"{winner} wins!")
        
        play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")
        while play_again.lower() not in ["y", "n"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter y for yes or n for no: ")

    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Computer chose: rock
Both players selected rock. It's a tie!

Play again? (y/n):
