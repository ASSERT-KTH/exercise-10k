## Exercise
Write a program that prints out a pattern of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence or a pyramid of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pyramid(n):
    """
    Prints a pyramid of numbers with n rows.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows in the pyramid.
    """
    num = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Print leading spaces
        print(" " * (n - i), end="")
        
        # Print numbers
        for _ in range(i):
            print(f"{num:2d}", end=" ")
            num += 1
        
        # Move to the next line
        print()

def main():
    # Example usage
    n = 5
    print(f"Pyramid of {n} rows:")
    print_pyramid(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Pyramid of 5 rows:
     1 
    2  3 
   4  5  6 
  7  8  9 10 
11 12 13 14 15
```
