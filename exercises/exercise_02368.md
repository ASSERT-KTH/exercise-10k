## Exercise
Write a program that generates an arithmetic sequence up to a given term.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n):
    """
    Generate an arithmetic sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        a (float): The first term of the sequence.
        d (float): The common difference between terms.
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the arithmetic sequence up to the nth term.
    """
    sequence = [a + i * d for i in range(n)]
    return sequence


def main():
    # Example usage
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term (a): "))
    common_difference = float(input("Enter the common difference (d): "))
    num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms (n): "))

    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)
    print("Arithmetic Sequence:")
    print(sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first term (a): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpp5cc8958.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpp5cc8958.py", line 19, in main
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term (a): "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 2 10'
```
