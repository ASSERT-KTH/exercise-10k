## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a function as input and groups the elements of the list by the result of applying the function to each element.

## Reference Solution
```python
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

# Test the group_by function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
groups = group_by(numbers, lambda x: x % 2)

for group in groups:
    print(list(group))
```

```python
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def group_by(input_list, key_fn):
    return groupby(sorted(input_list, key=key_fn), key=key_fn)

# Test the group_by function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
groups = group_by(numbers, lambda x: x % 2)

for group in groups:
    print(list(group))
```

## Generated Output
