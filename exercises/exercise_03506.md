## Exercise
Write a program that performs basic boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT) using variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define boolean variables
a = True
b = False

# Perform AND operation
and_result = a and b
print(f"a AND b: {and_result}")

# Perform OR operation
or_result = a or b
print(f"a OR b: {or_result}")

# Perform NOT operation
not_a = not a
not_b = not b
print(f"NOT a: {not_a}")
print(f"NOT b: {not_b}")

# Perform more complex operations
complex_and_result = (a and b) or (not a and not b)
print(f"(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT b): {complex_and_result}")

complex_or_result = (a or b) and (not a or not b)
print(f"(a OR b) AND (NOT a OR NOT b): {complex_or_result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
a AND b: False
a OR b: True
NOT a: False
NOT b: True
(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT b): False
(a OR b) AND (NOT a OR NOT b): True
```
