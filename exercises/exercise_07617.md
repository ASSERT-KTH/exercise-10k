## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user to guess a random number until they guess correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_random_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        # Ask the user to guess the number
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if user_guess < random_number:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > random_number:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_random_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcg48htec.py", line 34, in <module>

  File "/tmp/tmpcg48htec.py", line 12, in guess_random_number
    user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
