## Exercise
Develop a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user, taking the user's choice as input and generating a random choice for the computer.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        elif user_choice.lower() not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice.lower(), computer_choice))
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: rock

It's a tie!

Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit:
