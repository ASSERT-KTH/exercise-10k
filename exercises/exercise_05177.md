## Exercise
Write a function to convert a dictionary to a set of keys.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dict_to_set(dictionary):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary as input and returns a set of its keys.

    Parameters:
    dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
    set: A set of keys from the input dictionary.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a dictionary")

    # Since dictionaries in Python have a built-in method to return a view object that displays a list of all keys,
    # we can use this method to get all the keys from the dictionary
    keys_view = dictionary.keys()

    # We then convert the view object to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate values
    # However, since dictionary keys are already unique, this step is not strictly necessary
    keys_set = set(keys_view)

    # Finally, we return the set of keys
    return keys_set

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(dict_to_set(my_dict))  # Output: {'a', 'b', 'c'}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a', 'c', 'b'}
```
