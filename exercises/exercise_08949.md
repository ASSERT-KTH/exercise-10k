## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate the use of assignment operators.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a variable and assign a value
x = 10
print("Initial value of x:", x)

# Addition assignment operator
x += 5
print("Value of x after x += 5:", x)

# Subtraction assignment operator
x -= 3
print("Value of x after x -= 3:", x)

# Multiplication assignment operator
x *= 2
print("Value of x after x *= 2:", x)

# Division assignment operator
x /= 2
print("Value of x after x /= 2:", x)

# Modulus assignment operator
x %= 3
print("Value of x after x %= 3:", x)

# Exponentiation assignment operator
x **= 2
print("Value of x after x **= 2:", x)

# Floor division assignment operator
x = 10
x //= 3
print("Value of x after x //= 3:", x)
```

## Generated Output
```
Initial value of x: 10
Value of x after x += 5: 15
Value of x after x -= 3: 12
Value of x after x *= 2: 24
Value of x after x /= 2: 12.0
Value of x after x %= 3: 0.0
Value of x after x **= 2: 0.0
Value of x after x //= 3: 3
```
