## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their gift card balance and then asks them for the price of an item they want to buy. If the item price is less than or equal to the gift card balance, print a message indicating that the item can be purchased. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the item cannot be purchased.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the user's gift card balance
balance = float(input("Enter the balance on your gift card: "))

# Get the price of the item
price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))

# Check if the item can be purchased
if price <= balance:
    print("You can purchase this item.")
else:
    print("You cannot purchase this item.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the balance on your gift card: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6kgg2fil.py", line 2, in <module>
    balance = float(input("Enter the balance on your gift card: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 20'
```
