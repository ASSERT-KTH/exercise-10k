## Exercise
Create a program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input and then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should then be printed to the console.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle

# Get input from the user
length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Define a function to calculate the area
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width

# Define a function to calculate the perimeter
def rectangle_perimeter(length, width):
    return 2 * (length + width)

# Calculate the area and perimeter
area = rectangle_area(length, width)
perimeter = rectangle_perimeter(length, width)

# Print the results
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is:", perimeter)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp3o55davi.py", line 4, in <module>
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 5'
```
