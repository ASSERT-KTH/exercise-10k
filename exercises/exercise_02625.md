## Exercise
Write a program that takes a starting number and the number of terms as input and generates a sequence of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(start, terms):
    """
    Generate a sequence of numbers starting from 'start' with 'terms' number of terms.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.
        terms (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the sequence.
    """
    sequence = [start + i for i in range(terms)]
    return sequence


def main():
    # Get the starting number and the number of terms from the user
    start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
    terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    # Generate the sequence
    sequence = generate_sequence(start, terms)

    # Print the sequence
    print("The sequence is:")
    print(sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the starting number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp7gaixom5.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp7gaixom5.py", line 18, in main
    start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 5'
```
