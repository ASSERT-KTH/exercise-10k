## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the future value of an investment given the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the future value of an investment.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of the investment.
        annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.
        years (int): The number of years the money is invested.

    Returns:
        float: The future value of the investment.
    """
    future_value = principal * (1 + annual_interest_rate) ** years
    return future_value


def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    annual_interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage: ")) / 100
    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)

    print(f"The future value of the investment is: ${future_value:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpt_o4ufyg.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpt_o4ufyg.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 10'
