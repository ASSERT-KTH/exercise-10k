## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. The program should have two functions: one to calculate the grade and another to display the result. The grade calculation is as follows: scores 90 and above are Grade A, scores between 80 and 89 are Grade B, scores between 70 and 79 are Grade C, scores between 60 and 69 are Grade D, and scores below 60 are Grade F.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.
    
    Args:
    score (float): The score of the student.
    
    Returns:
    str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Define a function to display the result
def display_result(name, score, grade):
    """
    Display the result of the student.
    
    Args:
    name (str): The name of the student.
    score (float): The score of the student.
    grade (str): The grade of the student.
    """
    print(f"Student Name: {name}")
    print(f"Score: {score}")
    print(f"Grade: {grade}")

# Main function
def main():
    name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Calculate the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)

    # Display the result
    display_result(name, score, grade)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's name: Enter the student's score: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpeqkn4cdm.py", line 49, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpeqkn4cdm.py", line 40, in main
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
