## Exercise
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence between 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA' is 'BCBA' with a length of 4.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):
    """
    Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.

    Args:
        seq1 (str): The first sequence.
        seq2 (str): The second sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest common subsequence.
    """
    m, n = len(seq1), len(seq2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage
seq1 = "ABCBDAB"
seq2 = "BDCABA"
print("Length of longest common subsequence:", longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of longest common subsequence: 4
```
