## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax on a given income based on a simple tax bracket system (e.g., 10% on income up to $1000, 20% on income above $1000)

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculate tax on a given income based on a simple tax bracket system.

    The tax brackets are:
    - 10% on income up to $1000
    - 20% on income above $1000

    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax.
    """
    if income < 0:
        raise ValueError("Income cannot be negative")

    # Define the tax brackets
    tax_brackets = [
        (1000, 0.10),  # 10% on income up to $1000
        (float('inf'), 0.20)  # 20% on income above $1000
    ]

    tax = 0
    previous_bracket = 0

    for bracket, rate in tax_brackets:
        taxable_amount = min(income, bracket) - previous_bracket
        if taxable_amount > 0:
            tax += taxable_amount * rate
        if income <= bracket:
            break
        previous_bracket = bracket

    return tax


# Example usage:
income = 1500
tax = calculate_tax(income)
print(f"The tax on an income of ${income} is ${tax:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The tax on an income of $1500 is $200.00
```
