## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades for three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and store it in a new dictionary. Then, it should print out the student names along with their average grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): Dictionary containing student names as keys and their grades as values.

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Calculate the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of subjects
        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
        
        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade

    # Return the average_grades dictionary
    return average_grades


def print_average_grades(average_grades):
    """
    Print out the student names along with their average grades.

    Args:
        average_grades (dict): Dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    # Iterate over each student in the average_grades dictionary
    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():
        # Print out the student name and their average grade
        print(f"Student: {student}, Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}")


def main():
    # Example usage:
    grades_dict = {
        "John": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78},
        "Alice": {"Math": 92, "Science": 88, "English": 95},
        "Bob": {"Math": 76, "Science": 82, "English": 89}
    }

    # Calculate the average grades
    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)

    # Print out the average grades
    print_average_grades(average_grades)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Student: John, Average Grade: 84.33
Student: Alice, Average Grade: 91.67
Student: Bob, Average Grade: 82.33
```
