## Exercise
Write a program that takes an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score 90-100 is A, 80-89 is B, 70-79 is C, 60-69 is D, and below 60 is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """Function to calculate the grade based on the score."""
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    """Main function to get the score from the user and print the grade."""
    try:
        score = float(input("Enter your exam score: "))
        if score < 0 or score > 100:
            print("Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100.")
        else:
            grade = calculate_grade(score)
            print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output

Enter your exam score: Your grade is: B
