## Exercise
Create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user can play against the computer.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
