## Exercise
Check the type of a variable and perform actions based on its type.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_type(var):
    """
    This function checks the type of a variable and performs actions based on its type.

    Parameters:
    var (any): The variable to be checked.

    Returns:
    str: A message indicating the type of the variable and the action taken.
    """

    # First, we'll check if the variable is an integer
    if isinstance(var, int):
        # If it's an integer, we'll print a message and perform some action (in this case, squaring the number)
        result = var ** 2
        return f"The variable is an integer. The square of {var} is {result}."

    # Next, we'll check if the variable is a string
    elif isinstance(var, str):
        # If it's a string, we'll print a message and perform some action (in this case, converting the string to uppercase)
        result = var.upper()
        return f"The variable is a string. The uppercase version of '{var}' is '{result}'."

    # Then, we'll check if the variable is a list
    elif isinstance(var, list):
        # If it's a list, we'll print a message and perform some action (in this case, printing the length of the list)
        result = len(var)
        return f"The variable is a list. The length of the list is {result}."

    # If the variable is none of the above types, we'll print a default message
    else:
        return f"The variable is of type {type(var).__name__}. No specific action is taken for this type."


# Test the function
print(check_type(5))  # Output: The variable is an integer. The square of 5 is 25.
print(check_type("hello"))  # Output: The variable is a string. The uppercase version of 'hello' is 'HELLO'.
print(check_type([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: The variable is a list. The length of the list is 3.
print(check_type(3.14))  # Output: The variable is of type float. No specific action is taken for this type.
```

## Generated Output
```
The variable is an integer. The square of 5 is 25.
The variable is a string. The uppercase version of 'hello' is 'HELLO'.
The variable is a list. The length of the list is 3.
The variable is of type float. No specific action is taken for this type.
