## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number (inclusive) using a for loop or a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_for(n):
    """Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a for loop."""
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def sum_even_while(n):
    """Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a while loop."""
    total = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
        i += 1
    return total

# Example usage
n = 10
print(f"Sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} (for loop): {sum_even_for(n)}")
print(f"Sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} (while loop): {sum_even_while(n)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 (for loop): 30
Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 (while loop): 30
```
