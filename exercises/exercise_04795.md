## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user to unscramble a word.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# List of words to choose from
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape"]

def scramble_word(word):
    """Scrambles a given word"""
    word_list = list(word)
    random.shuffle(word_list)
    return "".join(word_list)

def main():
    # Choose a random word from the list
    original_word = random.choice(words)
    
    # Scramble the word
    scrambled_word = scramble_word(original_word)
    
    # Ask the user to unscramble the word
    print("Unscramble the word: ", scrambled_word)
    user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
    
    # Check the user's answer
    if user_answer.lower() == original_word:
        print("Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed", original_word)
    else:
        print("Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is", original_word)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
