## Exercise
Create a program that plays rock paper scissors with the user. If the user chooses rock and the computer chooses scissors, the user wins. If the user chooses paper and the computer chooses rock, the user wins. If the user chooses scissors and the computer chooses paper, the user wins.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of rock paper scissors"""
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

def main():
    play_again = "y"
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (y/n): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
