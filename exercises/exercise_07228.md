## Exercise
Create a simple chatbot that responds to user input. The chatbot should greet the user, ask for their name, and then engage in a basic conversation. The conversation should include asking the user about their favorite color and responding with a personalized message.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello! I'm {self.name}. It's nice to meet you.")

    def ask_name(self):
        user_name = input("What's your name? ")
        return user_name

    def ask_favorite_color(self, user_name):
        favorite_color = input(f"Hi {user_name}, what's your favorite color? ")
        return favorite_color

    def respond_to_color(self, user_name, favorite_color):
        print(f"Ah, {favorite_color} is a great choice, {user_name}! I hope you get to see a lot of {favorite_color} in your day.")


def main():
    chatbot_name = "Llama"
    chatbot = Chatbot(chatbot_name)

    chatbot.greet()
    user_name = chatbot.ask_name()
    favorite_color = chatbot.ask_favorite_color(user_name)
    chatbot.respond_to_color(user_name, favorite_color)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello! I'm Llama. It's nice to meet you.
What's your name? Hi Hello, what's your favorite color? Ah, John is a great choice, Hello! I hope you get to see a lot of John in your day.
