## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the first number from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Get the second number from the user
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the sum
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmbdv64er.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
