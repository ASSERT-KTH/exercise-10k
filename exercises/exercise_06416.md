## Exercise
Write a program that takes the current weather as input and prints out a forecast. Use if/else statements to determine the forecast.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_forecast(weather):
    """
    Returns a forecast based on the current weather.

    Args:
        weather (str): The current weather (e.g. "sunny", "rainy", "cloudy", etc.)

    Returns:
        str: A forecast for the next day
    """
    if weather.lower() == "sunny":
        return "Expect a clear sky with plenty of sunshine tomorrow."
    elif weather.lower() == "rainy":
        return "There's a chance of scattered showers tomorrow, so don't forget your umbrella."
    elif weather.lower() == "cloudy":
        return "It's likely to be overcast tomorrow, with a high chance of light drizzle."
    elif weather.lower() == "windy":
        return "Hold onto your hat, as tomorrow is expected to be quite gusty."
    elif weather.lower() == "snowy":
        return "Get your scarf and gloves ready, as tomorrow is expected to be cold and snowy."
    else:
        return "Unable to determine forecast for unknown weather condition."

def main():
    # Get the current weather from the user
    weather = input("Enter the current weather: ")

    # Get the forecast
    forecast = get_forecast(weather)

    # Print the forecast
    print(forecast)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current weather: Expect a clear sky with plenty of sunshine tomorrow.
```
