        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The product of num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 * num2

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 7
    product = calculate_product(num1, num2)
    print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {product}")
