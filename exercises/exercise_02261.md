## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Main function
def main():
    # Get two numbers from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the sum
    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)
    print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum_of_numbers)

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8v9spyvo.py", line 17, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp8v9spyvo.py", line 8, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
