## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and a sublist as input, and returns True if the sublist is found in the list, and False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_sublist_found(main_list, sub_list):
    """
    This function checks if a sublist is present in a main list.
    
    Args:
        main_list (list): The main list to be searched.
        sub_list (list): The sublist to be found.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the sublist is found, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # We will iterate over the main list with a sliding window of size equal to the length of the sub list
    # This is because we need to check every possible sub list of the main list that has the same length as the given sub list
    
    # First, we get the length of the main list and the sub list
    main_list_len = len(main_list)
    
    # We also get the length of the sub list
    sub_list_len = len(sub_list)
    
    # If the sub list is empty, it is considered to be a sublist of any list
    if sub_list_len == 0:
        return True
    
    # If the main list is empty or its length is less than the length of the sub list, the sub list cannot be a sublist of the main list
    if main_list_len < sub_list_len:
        return False
    
    # Now, we iterate over the main list with a sliding window of size equal to the length of the sub list
    for i in range(main_list_len - sub_list_len + 1):
        
        # For each window, we check if it is equal to the sub list
        if main_list[i:i + sub_list_len] == sub_list:
            
            # If we find a match, we immediately return True
            return True
    
    # If we have checked all windows and haven't found a match, we return False
    return False
```
