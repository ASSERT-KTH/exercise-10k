## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input and then prints out a greeting message with their name and a message stating whether they are eligible to vote or not based on their age. Assume the voting age is 18.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user's name and age
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Print greeting message
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Check if user is eligible to vote
if age >= 18:
    print(f"{name}, you are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print(f"{name}, you are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.")
```

```python
Hello, John!
John, you are eligible to vote.
```

```python
Hello, Jane!
Jane, you are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.
```

## Generated Output
