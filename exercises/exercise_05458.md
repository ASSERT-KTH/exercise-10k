## Exercise
Write a program that takes a bill amount and number of people as input and prints out the amount each person owes

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_split_bill(bill_amount, num_people):
    """
    Calculate the amount each person owes.

    Args:
        bill_amount (float): The total bill amount.
        num_people (int): The number of people to split the bill.

    Returns:
        float: The amount each person owes.
    """
    if num_people <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of people must be greater than zero.")

    split_amount = bill_amount / num_people
    return split_amount

def main():
    # Get user input
    bill_amount = float(input("Enter the bill amount: $"))
    num_people = int(input("Enter the number of people: "))

    # Calculate the split bill
    try:
        split_amount = calculate_split_bill(bill_amount, num_people)
        print(f"Each person owes: ${split_amount:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the bill amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqgzj44vy.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqgzj44vy.py", line 20, in main
    bill_amount = float(input("Enter the bill amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 4'
