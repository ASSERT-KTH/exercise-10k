## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) based on a given number of rows.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pattern(rows):
    """
    Prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on a given number of rows.
    
    Args:
        rows (int): The number of rows in the pattern.
    """
    for i in range(rows):
        # Print asterisks on each row, with the number of asterisks equal to the current row number plus one
        print('* ' * (i + 1))

def main():
    # Get the number of rows from the user
    rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
    
    # Print the pattern
    print_pattern(rows)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
