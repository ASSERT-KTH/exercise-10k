## Exercise
Create a function to find the last non-repeated character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def last_non_repeated_char(s):
    """
    Finds the last non-repeated character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The last non-repeated character, or None if no such character exists.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store character frequencies
    char_freq = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_freq:
            char_freq[char] += 1
        else:
            char_freq[char] = 1
    
    # Find the last non-repeated character
    for char in reversed(s):
        if char_freq[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # Return None if no non-repeated character exists
    return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(last_non_repeated_char("hello"))  # Output: 'o'
    print(last_non_repeated_char("aabbcc"))  # Output: None
    print(last_non_repeated_char("abcde"))  # Output: 'e'
```

## Generated Output
```
o
None
e
```
