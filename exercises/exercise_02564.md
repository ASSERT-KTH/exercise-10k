## Exercise
Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    factorial = 1
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        factorial *= i
        i += 1

    return factorial

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {calculate_factorial(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
