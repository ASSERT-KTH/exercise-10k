## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the frequency of each character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_character_frequency(input_string):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.
    """
    frequency_dict = {}
    for char in input_string:
        if char in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[char] = 1
    return frequency_dict

def print_frequency_results(frequency_dict):
    """
    Print the frequency results.

    Args:
        frequency_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.
    """
    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():
        print(f"Character: {char}, Frequency: {frequency}")

def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    frequency_dict = calculate_character_frequency(input_string)
    print_frequency_results(frequency_dict)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Character: h, Frequency: 1
Character: e, Frequency: 1
Character: l, Frequency: 2
Character: o, Frequency: 1
```
