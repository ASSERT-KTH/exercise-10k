## Exercise
Write a program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Use a while loop to repeatedly extract the node with the minimum distance.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start_node):

    Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

                  and its corresponding value is another dictionary. The inner
                  dictionary's keys are the node's neighbors, and its values are
                  the edge weights.
    start_node (str): The node to start the search from.

    Returns:
    distances (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values
                      are the shortest distances from the start node.
    previous_nodes (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the
                           values are the previous nodes in the shortest path.

# Example usage
