## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"


def main():
    # Get the student's score from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                break
            else:
                print("Score must be between 0 and 100. Please try again.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and display the student's grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is {grade}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is B.
```
