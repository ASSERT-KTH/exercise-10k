## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for the cost of their meal and the tip percentage they want to give. Then, calculate the total cost (including tip) and print it out

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost():
    """
    Asks the user for the cost of their meal and the tip percentage they want to give.
    Then, calculates the total cost (including tip) and prints it out.
    """
    # Get the cost of the meal from the user
    while True:
        try:
            meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of your meal: $"))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

    # Get the tip percentage from the user
    while True:
        try:
            tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (e.g. 15 for 15%): "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

    # Calculate the tip amount
    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)

    # Calculate the total cost (including tip)
    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount

    # Print the results
    print(f"\nMeal Cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Tip ({tip_percentage}%): ${tip_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_total_cost()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the cost of your meal: $Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.
Enter the cost of your meal: $
