## Exercise
Write a function called 'sum_even_numbers' that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.
    """

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers, starting at 0
    even_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is even by using the modulus operator (%)
        # If the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0, it's even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is even, add it to the sum
            even_sum += num

    # After iterating over all numbers, return the sum of even numbers
    return even_sum

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
12
```
