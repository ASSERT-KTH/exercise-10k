## Exercise
Create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the two.

## Reference Solution
```python
def concatenate_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the two.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to be concatenated.
        list2 (list): The second list to be concatenated.

    Returns:
        list: A new list that is the concatenation of list1 and list2.
    """

    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # Now, we can use the built-in list concatenation operator (+) to concatenate the two lists.
    # This operator returns a new list that contains all elements from both lists.
    concatenated_list = list1 + list2

    # Finally, we return the concatenated list.
    return concatenated_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
print(concatenate_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
