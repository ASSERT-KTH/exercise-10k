## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the tax amount and the final price of a product given the original price and tax percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(original_price, tax_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount and the final price of a product.

    Args:
        original_price (float): The original price of the product.
        tax_percentage (float): The tax percentage.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the tax amount and the final price.
    """
    tax_amount = (original_price / 100) * tax_percentage
    final_price = original_price + tax_amount
    return tax_amount, final_price

def main():
    # Get user input
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
    tax_percentage = float(input("Enter the tax percentage: "))

    # Calculate tax and final price
    tax_amount, final_price = calculate_tax(original_price, tax_percentage)

    # Print results
    print(f"Tax Amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the original price: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp77_jlzv5.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp77_jlzv5.py", line 18, in main
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
