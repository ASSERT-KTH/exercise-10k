## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def least_frequent_char(s):
    """
    Find the least frequent character in a string.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    list: A list of the least frequent characters.
    """
    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Find the minimum frequency
    min_freq = min(char_count.values())
    
    # Find all characters with the minimum frequency
    least_frequent = [char for char, freq in char_count.items() if freq == min_freq]
    
    return least_frequent

# Example usage
print(least_frequent_char("Hello World"))
```
