## Exercise
Create a function that takes the side length of a cube as an argument and returns its volume

## Reference Solution
```python
def cube_volume(side_length: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the volume of a cube.

    Args:
    side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.

    Returns:
    float: The volume of the cube.
    """
    if side_length < 0:
        raise ValueError("Side length cannot be negative")
    return side_length ** 3

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    side_length = 5.0
    volume = cube_volume(side_length)
    print(f"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The volume of the cube with side length 5.0 is 125.0
```
