## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python

board = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the game board with 9 empty spaces

def print_board():
    """Print the current state of the game board"""
    print(f" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} ")
    print("---+---+---")
    print(f" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} ")

def check_win():
    """Check if there's a winner"""
    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':
            return board[condition[0]]
    if ' ' not in board:
        return 'Tie'
    return False

def main():
    current_player = 'X'
    while True:
        print_board()
        move = input(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9): ")
        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':
            print("Invalid move, try again.")
            continue
        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player
        result = check_win()
        if result:
            print_board()
            if result == 'Tie':
                print("It's a tie!")
            else:
                print(f"Player {result} wins!")
            break
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
