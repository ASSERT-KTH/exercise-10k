## Exercise
Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score and returns their corresponding grade. The grades are calculated as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not a number or is not within the range of 0 to 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """

    # First, we check if the input score is not a number
    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)):
        # If it's not a number, we raise a TypeError with a descriptive message
        raise TypeError("Input score must be a number.")

    # Next, we check if the input score is not within the range of 0 to 100
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        # If it's not within the range, we raise a ValueError with a descriptive message
        raise ValueError("Input score must be between 0 and 100.")

    # Now, we can start calculating the grade
    # We use an if-elif-else statement to check the score and return the corresponding grade
    # We start with the highest grade and go down to the lowest
    if score >= 90: 
        # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80: 
        # If the score is 80 or above but less than 90, the grade is B
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70: 
        # If the score is 70 or above but less than 80, the grade is C
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60: 
        # If the score is 60 or above but less than 70, the grade is D
        return 'D'
    else: 
        # If the score is less than 60, the grade is F
        return 'F'
```
