## Exercise
Create a function that uses map, filter, and reduce to calculate the sum of squares of even numbers in a list

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of even numbers in the list.
    """
    # Filter even numbers from the list
    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
    
    # Square each even number
    squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, even_numbers))
    
    # Calculate the sum of squares using reduce
    sum_of_squares = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, squares, 0)
    
    return sum_of_squares

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of squares of even numbers:", result)
```

```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, map(lambda x: x ** 2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)), 0)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squares of even numbers: 56
```
