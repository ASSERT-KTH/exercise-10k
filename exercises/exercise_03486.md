## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def power(x, n):
    res = 1
    for i in range(n):
        res *= x
    return res

def main():
    x = 2
    n = 3
    print(f'{x}^{n} = {power(x, n)}')

main()
```

## Generated Output
