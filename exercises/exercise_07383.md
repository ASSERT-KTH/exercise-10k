## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the program should print the new balance after the withdrawal. Use conditional statements (if/else) to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
def simulate_bank_transaction():
    # Ask for the user's current balance
    current_balance = float(input("Enter your current balance: "))

    # Ask for the withdrawal amount
    withdrawal_amount = float(input("Enter the amount you want to withdraw: "))

    # Check if the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance
    if withdrawal_amount > current_balance:
        print("Insufficient funds")
    else:
        # Calculate the new balance
        new_balance = current_balance - withdrawal_amount
        print(f"Withdrawal successful. Your new balance is ${new_balance:.2f}")

# Call the function to start the simulation
simulate_bank_transaction()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your current balance: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    simulate_bank_transaction()
  File "/tmp/tmp4axj_m4h.py", line 3, in simulate_bank_transaction
    current_balance = float(input("Enter your current balance: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 500'
