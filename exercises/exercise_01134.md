## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a conversation with the user

## Reference Solution
```python
# conversation_simulator.py

class ConversationSimulator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.responses = {
            "hello": "Hi! How are you today?",
            "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
            "what's your name": "My name is Conversation Simulator.",
            "exit": "Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.",
            "default": "I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?"
        }

    def get_response(self, user_input):
        user_input = user_input.lower()
        for keyword in self.responses:
            if keyword in user_input:
                return self.responses[keyword]
        return self.responses["default"]

    def start_conversation(self):
        print("Welcome to the conversation simulator! Type 'exit' to quit.")
        while True:
            user_input = input("You: ")
            if user_input.lower() == "exit":
                print("Simulator: ", self.get_response(user_input))
                break
            else:
                print("Simulator: ", self.get_response(user_input))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulator = ConversationSimulator()
    simulator.start_conversation()
```

```python
self.responses["what's your favorite food"] = "I don't have personal preferences, but I can tell you about different types of cuisine!"
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the conversation simulator! Type 'exit' to quit.
You: Simulator:  Hi! How are you today?
You:
