## Exercise
Write a function to partition a list of integers into two separate lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Partition a list of integers into two separate lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists: even numbers and odd numbers.
    """
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    odd_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
    return even_numbers, odd_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even, odd = partition_numbers(numbers)
print("Even numbers:", even)
print("Odd numbers:", odd)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
