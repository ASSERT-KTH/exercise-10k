## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number using conditional statements.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    else:
        return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1)


def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    try:
        factorial = calculate_factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The factorial of 5 is 120
```
