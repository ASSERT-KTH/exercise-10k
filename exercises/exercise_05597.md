## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle.

    Args:
    base (float): The base of the triangle.
    height (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    if base < 0 or height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Base and height must be non-negative.")

    area = 0.5 * base * height
    return area

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    base = 5.0
    height = 6.0
    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
    print(f"The area of the triangle with base {base} and height {height} is {area}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The area of the triangle with base 5.0 and height 6.0 is 15.0.
```
