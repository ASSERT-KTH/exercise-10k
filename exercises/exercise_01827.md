## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of elements at even indices in a given array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_indices(arr):
    """
    Calculate the sum of elements at even indices in a given array.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of elements at even indices.
    """
    return sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 == 0)


# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = sum_even_indices(arr)
print("Sum of elements at even indices:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of elements at even indices: 9
```
