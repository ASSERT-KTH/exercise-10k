## Exercise
Create a function that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The grade should be 'A' for scores above 90, 'B' for scores between 80 and 90, 'C' for scores between 70 and 80, 'D' for scores between 60 and 70, and 'F' for scores below 60.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates a student's grade based on their score.
    
    The grade is determined by the following criteria:
    - 'A' for scores above 90
    - 'B' for scores between 80 and 90
    - 'C' for scores between 70 and 80
    - 'D' for scores between 60 and 70
    - 'F' for scores below 60

    Parameters:
    score (float): The student's score

    Returns:
    str: The student's grade
    """

    # First, we check if the score is above 90 to assign an 'A' grade
    if score > 90:
        return 'A'
    
    # If the score is not above 90, we check if it's between 80 and 90 to assign a 'B' grade
    elif 80 <= score <= 90:
        return 'B'
    
    # If the score is not between 80 and 90, we check if it's between 70 and 80 to assign a 'C' grade
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return 'C'
    
    # If the score is not between 70 and 80, we check if it's between 60 and 70 to assign a 'D' grade
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return 'D'
    
    # If the score is not between 60 and 70, it must be below 60, so we assign an 'F' grade
    else:
        return 'F'

# Test the function
print(calculate_grade(95))  # Should print 'A'
print(calculate_grade(85))  # Should print 'B'
print(calculate_grade(75))  # Should print 'C'
print(calculate_grade(65))  # Should print 'D'
print(calculate_grade(55))  # Should print 'F'
```
