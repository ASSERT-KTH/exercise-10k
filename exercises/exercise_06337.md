## Exercise
Write a program that takes a nested array as input, flattens it into a one-dimensional array, and returns the flattened array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a nested list as input and returns a new list with all sublists concatenated into a new list.

    :param nested_list: A list that can contain other lists
    :return: A new list with all sublists concatenated into a new list
    """
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list += flatten(item)
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list

# Example usage:
nested_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7, [8, 9]]
print(flatten(nested_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
