## Exercise
Write a program to partition a list into two lists based on a condition and print the resulting lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Partitions a list into two lists based on a condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements for which the condition is True,
               and the second list contains elements for which the condition is False.
    """
    true_list = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]
    false_list = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]
    return true_list, false_list


def is_even(num):
    """
    Checks if a number is even.

    Args:
        num (int): The number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.
    """
    return num % 2 == 0


def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, is_even)

    print("Original list:", numbers)
    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
    print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
