## Exercise
Write a program to print the following pattern using loops: for a given number n, print a pattern of asterisks (*) where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row, and the total number of rows is n. For example, if n = 4, the pattern should be: 
* 
** 
*** 
****

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_asterisk_pattern(n):
    """
    Prints a pattern of asterisks (*) where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row,
    and the total number of rows is n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows in the pattern.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print("*" * i)

# Example usage:
n = 4
print(f"Pattern for n = {n}:")
print_asterisk_pattern(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
Pattern for n = 4:
*
**
***
****
```
