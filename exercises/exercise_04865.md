## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number.

    Args:
    n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        i = 1
        result = 1
        while i <= n:
            result *= i
            i += 1
        return result

# Example usage:
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The factorial of 5 is 120
```
