## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), score >= 80 and score < 90 (B), score >= 70 and score < 80 (C), score >= 60 and score < 70 (D), score < 60 (F). The program should use conditional statements (if/else) to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int score;

    cout << "Enter a score: ";
    cin >> score;

    if (score >= 90) {
        cout << "Grade: A" << endl;
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        cout << "Grade: B" << endl;
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        cout << "Grade: C" << endl;
    } else if (score >= 60) {
        cout << "Grade: D" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Grade: F" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
