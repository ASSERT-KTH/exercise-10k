## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_elements(a, b):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    result = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            result.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif a[i] < b[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    return result

# Example usage:
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(common_elements(a, b))  # Output: [4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5]
```
