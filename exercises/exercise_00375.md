## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. The program should take the score as input and output the corresponding grade. The grades are as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.
    
    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.
    
    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade.
    """
    
    # Check if the score is within the valid range (0-100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100."
    
    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade
    if score >= 90:  # Check for grade A
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:  # Check for grade B
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:  # Check for grade C
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:  # Check for grade D
        return "D"
    else:  # If the score is below 60, it's an F
        return "F"


def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    score = float(input("Enter the score: "))
    
    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The grade is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score: The grade is: B
```
