## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the power of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_power(base, exponent):
    """
    Calculate the power of a given number.

    Args:
        base (float): The base number.
        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the power operation.
    """
    return base ** exponent

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    base = 2
    exponent = 3
    result = calculate_power(base, exponent)
    print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```
