## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the discount amount and selling price of a product given its original price and discount percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discount amount and selling price of a product.

    Args:
    original_price (float): The original price of the product.
    discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the discount amount and the selling price.
    """

    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage

    # Calculate the selling price
    selling_price = original_price - discount_amount

    return discount_amount, selling_price


def main():
    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

    # Calculate the discount amount and selling price
    discount_amount, selling_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)

    # Print the results
    print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%")
    print(f"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Selling Price: ${selling_price:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output

Enter the original price:

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwznh016x.py", line 24, in main
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
