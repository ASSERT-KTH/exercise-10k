## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the gross pay of an employee given their hourly wage and hours worked.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gross_pay(hourly_wage, hours_worked):
    """
    Calculates the gross pay of an employee.

    Args:
        hourly_wage (float): The hourly wage of the employee.
        hours_worked (float): The number of hours worked by the employee.

    Returns:
        float: The gross pay of the employee.
    """
    gross_pay = hourly_wage * hours_worked
    return gross_pay

def main():
    # Get user input
    hourly_wage = float(input("Enter the hourly wage: $"))
    hours_worked = float(input("Enter the number of hours worked: "))

    # Calculate gross pay
    gross_pay = calculate_gross_pay(hourly_wage, hours_worked)

    # Print result
    print(f"Gross pay: ${gross_pay:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the hourly wage: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
