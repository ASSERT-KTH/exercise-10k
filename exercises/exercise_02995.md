## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect square.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)
    return sqrt == int(sqrt)

def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [4, 9, 16, 20, 25]
    for num in numbers:
        if is_perfect_square(num):
            print(f"{num} is a perfect square.")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is not a perfect square.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
4 is a perfect square.
9 is a perfect square.
16 is a perfect square.
20 is not a perfect square.
25 is a perfect square.
```
