## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring(string, substring):
    """
    This function finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a given string.

    Args:
        string (str): The main string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    """

    # First, we check if the substring is empty
    # If it is, we return 0 because an empty string is technically a substring of every string
    if not substring:
        return 0

    # Then, we use the built-in str.find() method in Python, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring
    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1
    # We store this result in the 'index' variable
    index = string.find(substring)

    # Finally, we return the index
    return index

# Example usage:
print(find_substring("Hello, World!", "World"))  # Output: 7
print(find_substring("Hello, World!", "Universe"))  # Output: -1
```

## Generated Output
```
7
-1
```
