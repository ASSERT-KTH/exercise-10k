## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the sum of squares of all elements in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(lst):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of squares of all elements in a given list.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of all elements in the list.
    """

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares, starting with 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for num in lst:
        # For each number, calculate its square and add it to the total sum
        total_sum += num ** 2
    
    # After iterating over all elements, return the total sum
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 55
```

## Generated Output
```
55
```
