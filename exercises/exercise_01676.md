## Exercise
Write a program that takes the temperature as input and prints the corresponding weather forecast (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) based on the following criteria: sunny (20-30), cloudy (10-19), rainy (0-9), snowy (below 0) using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def weather_forecast(temperature):
    """
    Prints the corresponding weather forecast based on the given temperature.

    Args:
        temperature (int): The temperature in degrees Celsius.
    """
    if temperature > 30 or temperature < -100:
        print("Invalid temperature range. Please enter a temperature between -100 and 30 degrees Celsius.")
    elif 20 <= temperature <= 30:
        print("The weather is sunny.")
    elif 10 <= temperature < 20:
        print("The weather is cloudy.")
    elif 0 <= temperature < 10:
        print("The weather is rainy.")
    else:
        print("The weather is snowy.")


def main():
    temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    weather_forecast(temperature)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: The weather is sunny.
```
