## Exercise
Create a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using a basic algorithm such as bubble sort or selection sort.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using Bubble Sort.

    Args:
        arr (list): The list of integers to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of integers.
    """
    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)

    # Iterate over the array n-1 times
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made
        swapped = False

        # Iterate over the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True

        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    return arr

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", bubble_sort(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
