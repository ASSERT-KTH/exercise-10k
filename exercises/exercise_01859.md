## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the elements from the input list, but with the inner lists flattened.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten(lst):
    result = []
    for i in lst:
        result += i
    return result

test_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(flatten(test_list))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
