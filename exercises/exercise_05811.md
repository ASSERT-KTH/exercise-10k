## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to convert a decimal number to binary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def decimal_to_binary(n):
    """
    Convert a decimal number to binary using a while loop.

    Args:
        n (int): The decimal number to convert.

    Returns:
        str: The binary representation of the decimal number.
    """
    binary = ""
    while n > 0:
        # Append the remainder of n divided by 2 to the binary string
        binary = str(n % 2) + binary
        # Update n to be the integer division of n by 2
        n = n // 2
    return binary

def main():
    # Get the decimal number from the user
    decimal_num = int(input("Enter a decimal number: "))

    # Convert the decimal number to binary
    binary_num = decimal_to_binary(decimal_num)

    # Print the binary representation
    print(f"The binary representation of {decimal_num} is {binary_num}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a decimal number: The binary representation of 10 is 1010
```
