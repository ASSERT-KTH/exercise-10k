## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(lst, condition):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if condition(lst[i]):
            result.append(lst[i])
    return result

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_list(lst, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(result)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
