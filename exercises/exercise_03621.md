## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all even numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.
    """
    even_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)
    return even_sum

def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
    print("Sum of even numbers:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
