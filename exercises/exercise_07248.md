## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 5;

    int c = a + b;
    int d = a - b;
    int e = a * b;
    double f = (double)a / b;

    printf("a + b = %d\n", c);
    printf("a - b = %d\n", d);
    printf("a * b = %d\n", e);
    printf("a / b = %.2f\n", f);

    return 0;
}
```
