## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a score and outputs the corresponding grade using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_grade(score):
    """
    This function determines a grade based on a score.

    Args:
        score (int): The score to determine the grade for.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade for the score.
    """

    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100."

    # Determine the grade based on the score
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

    # Determine and print the grade
    print("Your grade is:", determine_grade(score))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
