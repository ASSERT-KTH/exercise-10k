## Exercise
Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
def perform_arithmetic_operations():
    # Define variables
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 2

    # Addition
    addition_result = num1 + num2
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}")

    # Subtraction
    subtraction_result = num1 - num2
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}")

    # Multiplication
    multiplication_result = num1 * num2
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}")

    # Division
    if num2 != 0:
        division_result = num1 / num2
        print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    perform_arithmetic_operations()
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 10 + 2 = 12
Subtraction: 10 - 2 = 8
Multiplication: 10 * 2 = 20
Division: 10 / 2 = 5.0
```
