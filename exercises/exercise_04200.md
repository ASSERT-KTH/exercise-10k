## Exercise
Write a function that generates a quiz with a set of questions and answers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, answers, correct_answer):
        """
        Initialize a Question object.

        Args:
            question (str): The question text.
            answers (list): A list of possible answers.
            correct_answer (str): The correct answer.
        """
        self.question = question
        self.answers = answers
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer

def generate_quiz(questions):
    """
    Generate a quiz with the given questions.

    Args:
        questions (list): A list of Question objects.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    score = 0
    for i, question in enumerate(questions):
        print(f"\nQuestion {i+1}: {question.question}")
        random_answers = random.sample(question.answers, len(question.answers))
        for j, answer in enumerate(random_answers):
            print(f"{j+1}. {answer}")
        user_answer = input("Enter the number of your answer: ")
        if random_answers[int(user_answer) - 1] == question.correct_answer:
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer was {question.correct_answer}.")
    print(f"\nQuiz completed. Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    questions = [
        Question("What is the capital of France?", ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Rome"], "Paris"),
        Question("What is the largest planet in our solar system?", ["Earth", "Saturn", "Jupiter", "Uranus"], "Jupiter"),
        Question("Who painted the Mona Lisa?", ["Leonardo da Vinci", "Michelangelo", "Raphael", "Caravaggio"], "Leonardo da Vinci")
    ]
    generate_quiz(questions)
```

## Generated Output

1. Paris
2. Berlin
3. London
4. Rome
Enter the number of your answer:
