## Exercise
Demonstrate the concept of variable scope by declaring a variable inside and outside a function.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a variable outside the function
x = 10

def my_function():
    # Declare a variable inside the function
    y = 20
    
    # Access the variable declared outside the function
    print("Value of x inside the function:", x)
    
    # Access the variable declared inside the function
    print("Value of y inside the function:", y)

# Access the variable declared outside the function
print("Value of x outside the function:", x)

# Try to access the variable declared inside the function
try:
    print("Value of y outside the function:", y)
except NameError:
    print("Error: y is not defined outside the function")

# Call the function
my_function()
```

## Generated Output
```
Value of x outside the function: 10
Error: y is not defined outside the function
Value of x inside the function: 10
Value of y inside the function: 20
```
