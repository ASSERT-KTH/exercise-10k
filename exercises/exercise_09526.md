## Exercise
Write a program that generates a pattern of numbers based on the input provided. The pattern should be generated using a nested loop structure. The outer loop should run for the number of rows provided, and the inner loop should run for the number of columns provided. The numbers in the pattern should be incremented by 1 for each position, starting from 1.

## Reference Solution
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(j + (i - 1) * 5, end=' ')
    print()
```

## Generated Output
```
1 2 3 4 5 
6 7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25
```
