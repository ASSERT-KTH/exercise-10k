## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers."""
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    """Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers."""
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Test the function
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm(num1, num2)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5ssayb5r.py", line 12, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 15'
```
