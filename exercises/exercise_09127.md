## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a set of grades. The program should take in a list of numerical grades as input and output the average grade. The average should be calculated by summing all the grades and dividing by the total number of grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
num_grades = 4
grades = []
sum_grades = 0

for i in range(num_grades):
    grade = float(input("Enter grade: "))
    grades.append(grade)
    sum_grades += grade

average = sum_grades / num_grades

print("Average grade:", average)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter grade: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9els8ii3.py", line 6, in <module>
    grade = float(input("Enter grade: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '[90, 85, 95, 88, 92]'
```
