## Exercise
Read a floating-point number from the user and print its cube

## Reference Solution
```python
def read_and_cube_float():
    """
    Reads a floating-point number from the user and prints its cube.
    """
    # Read a floating-point number from the user
    while True:
        try:
            num = float(input("Enter a floating-point number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid floating-point number.")

    # Calculate and print the cube of the number
    cube = num ** 3
    print(f"The cube of {num} is: {cube}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    read_and_cube_float()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a floating-point number: The cube of 2.5 is: 15.625
