## Exercise
Create a program that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given text. The user should be able to input the text and the program should then print out the word counts.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re
from collections import Counter

def count_words(text):
    """
    Count the occurrences of each word in a given text.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the counts.
    """
    # Convert the text to lowercase and remove punctuation
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()

    # Count the occurrences of each word
    word_counts = Counter(words)

    return word_counts

def main():
    # Get the user input text
    text = input("Please enter a text: ")

    # Count the word occurrences
    word_counts = count_words(text)

    # Print out the word counts
    print("Word Counts:")
    for word, count in word_counts.most_common():
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a text: Word Counts:
hello: 2
world: 1
```
