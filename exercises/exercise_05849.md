## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a traffic light. The program should start with a green light and then change to yellow after 5 seconds, and then change to red after 2 seconds. The program should print out the current color of the light

## Reference Solution
```python
import time

class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.colors = ["green", "yellow", "red"]
        self.current_color = self.colors[0]

    def change_color(self, new_color, delay):
        print(f"The light is {self.current_color}")
        time.sleep(delay)
        self.current_color = new_color

    def run(self):
        print("Traffic light simulator started.")
        self.change_color("yellow", 5)
        self.change_color("red", 2)
        print(f"The light is {self.current_color}")

def main():
    traffic_light = TrafficLight()
    traffic_light.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
