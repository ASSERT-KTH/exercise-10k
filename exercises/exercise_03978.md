## Exercise
Implement the radix sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The program should take a list of integers as input and output the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def radix_sort(nums):
    RADIX = 10
    placement = 1

    max_digit = max(nums)

    while placement < max_digit:
        buckets = [list() for _ in range(RADIX)]
        for i in nums:
            tmp = int((i / placement) % RADIX)
            buckets[tmp].append(i)
        a = 0
        for b in range(RADIX):
            buck = buckets[b]
            for i in buck:
                nums[a] = i
                a += 1
        placement *= RADIX
    return nums


# Example usage:
numbers = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", radix_sort(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
Sorted list: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]
```
