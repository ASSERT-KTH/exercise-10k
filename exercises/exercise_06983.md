## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input, dividend and divisor, 
    and returns the quotient and remainder.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """

    # Check if the divisor is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Divisor cannot be zero.")

    # Calculate the quotient and remainder
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor

    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    # Get the input from the user
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    # Call the function and print the result
    try:
        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppmr385fb.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmppmr385fb.py", line 27, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
```
