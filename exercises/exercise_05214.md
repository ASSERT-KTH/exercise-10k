## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the change amount based on the payment and total bill provided by the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_change(total_bill, payment):
    """
    Calculates the change amount based on the payment and total bill.

    Args:
        total_bill (float): The total bill amount.
        payment (float): The payment amount.

    Returns:
        float: The change amount.
    """
    if payment < total_bill:
        return "Insufficient payment. Please pay the full amount."
    else:
        return payment - total_bill


def main():
    # Get the total bill and payment from the user
    total_bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: $"))
    payment = float(input("Enter the payment amount: $"))

    # Calculate the change amount
    change = calculate_change(total_bill, payment)

    # Print the change amount
    if isinstance(change, str):
        print(change)
    else:
        print(f"Change: ${change:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp65y3o9dt.py", line 20, in main
    total_bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: $"))
