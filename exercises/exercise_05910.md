## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of strings and a separator as input and returns a single string with the strings joined by the separator

    """
    return separator.join(string_list)

# Example usage:
strings = ["Hello", "world", "this", "is", "a", "test"]
separator = ", "
print(join_strings(strings, separator))
```

```python
def join_strings(string_list, separator):
    return separator.join(map(str, string_list))
