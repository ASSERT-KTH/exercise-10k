## Exercise
Write a program that takes a username as input and determines whether it is valid based on the following conditions: the username must be at least 3 characters long and contain only letters and numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_username(username):
    """
    Validate a username based on the following conditions:
    - The username must be at least 3 characters long.
    - The username must contain only letters and numbers.

    Args:
        username (str): The username to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the username is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the username is at least 3 characters long
    if len(username) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Check if the username contains only letters and numbers
    if not re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$", username):
        return False
    
    # If all checks pass, the username is valid
    return True

def main():
    username = input("Enter a username: ")
    if validate_username(username):
        print("The username is valid.")
    else:
        print("The username is not valid.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
