## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the student's score from the user
score = int(input("Enter the student's score: "))

# Determine the grade based on the score
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    grade = "D"
elif score < 60:
    grade = "F"

# Print the grade
print("The student's grade is:", grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
