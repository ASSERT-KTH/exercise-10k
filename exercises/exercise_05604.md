## Exercise
Write a program that takes a story template with placeholders for different types of words (e.g. noun, verb, adjective), then asks the user to input words to fill in the placeholders and prints out the completed story.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to get user input for a specific word type
def get_word(prompt):
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:
            return word
        print("Please enter a word.")

# Define the story template with placeholders
story_template = """
Once upon a time, in a {adjective1} land, there lived a {adjective2} {noun1}. This {noun1} loved to {verb1} in the {adjective3} sun. One day, while {verb2} through the {adjective4} forest, the {noun1} stumbled upon a {adjective5} {noun2}. The {noun1} was so {adjective6} that it decided to {verb3} the {noun2} home.
"""

# Define the placeholders and their corresponding prompts
placeholders = {
    "adjective1": "Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): ",
    "adjective2": "Enter another adjective (e.g. big, fluffy, smart): ",
    "noun1": "Enter a noun (e.g. dog, cat, car): ",
    "verb1": "Enter a verb ending in -ing (e.g. running, jumping, dancing): ",
    "adjective3": "Enter an adjective (e.g. warm, sunny, cloudy): ",
    "verb2": "Enter another verb ending in -ing (e.g. walking, hiking, biking): ",
    "adjective4": "Enter an adjective (e.g. dark, mysterious, magical): ",
    "adjective5": "Enter an adjective (e.g. beautiful, old, rusty): ",
    "noun2": "Enter another noun (e.g. book, chair, tree): ",
    "adjective6": "Enter an adjective (e.g. excited, curious, happy): ",
    "verb3": "Enter a verb (e.g. take, bring, carry): "
}

# Get user input for each placeholder
user_input = {}
for placeholder, prompt in placeholders.items():
    user_input[placeholder] = get_word(prompt)

# Fill in the story template with the user's input
completed_story = story_template.format(**user_input)

# Print the completed story
print("\nHere is the completed story:")
print(completed_story)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): Enter another adjective (e.g. big, fluffy, smart): Enter a noun (e.g. dog, cat, car): Enter a verb ending in -ing (e.g. running, jumping, dancing): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    user_input[placeholder] = get_word(prompt)
  File "/tmp/tmp7te_v_lx.py", line 4, in get_word
    word = input(prompt)
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
