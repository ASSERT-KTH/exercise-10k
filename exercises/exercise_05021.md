## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    even_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum variable to 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
            even_sum += i  # If even, add it to the sum
    return even_sum


# Example usage:
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The sum of all even numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum_even_numbers(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
```
