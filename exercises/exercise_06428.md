## Exercise
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. Use a for loop to iterate over the sequence and calculate each number as the sum of the two preceding ones.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {0, 1};
    int count = 2;

    for (int i = 2; i < 10; i++) {
        int next_number = sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 1];
        sequence.push_back(next_number);
        count++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << sequence[i] << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
