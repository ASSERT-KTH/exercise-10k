## Exercise
Given two dictionaries, write a function to merge them into a single dictionary. If a key exists in both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary should be used.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function merges two dictionaries into one. If a key exists in both dictionaries, 
    the value from the second dictionary is used.

    Parameters:
    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.
    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.

    Returns:
    dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
    """

    # Create a copy of the first dictionary to avoid modifying it directly
    merged_dict = dict1.copy()
    
    # Update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary
    # This will overwrite any duplicate keys with the values from the second dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict2)
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict

# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

print(merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
