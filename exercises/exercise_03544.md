## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    Merge two lists into a new list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to merge.
        list2 (list): The second list to merge.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.
    """
    return list1 + list2

# Example usage:
def main():
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]

    merged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)
    print("Merged List:", merged_list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
