## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width. The program should use the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width) to calculate the perimeter.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int length, width, perimeter;

    cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> length;

    cout << "Enter the width of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> width;

    perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

    cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << perimeter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
