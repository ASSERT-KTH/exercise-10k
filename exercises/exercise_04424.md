## Exercise
Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    i = 2
    while i < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
        i += 1
    return sequence[:n]

# Test the function
n = 10
print(f"The first {n} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
