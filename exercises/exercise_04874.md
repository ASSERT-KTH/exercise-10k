## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested loops to print Pascal's triangle.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pascals_triangle(n):
    """
    Prints Pascal's triangle up to n rows.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows to print.
    """
    # Initialize the first row of Pascal's triangle
    triangle = [[1]]

    # Generate each row of Pascal's triangle
    for i in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        # Calculate the middle elements of the current row
        for j in range(1, i):
            row.append(triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j])
        row.append(1)
        triangle.append(row)

    # Print Pascal's triangle
    for i in range(n):
        # Print leading spaces
        print(" " * (n - i - 1), end="")
        # Print the current row
        for num in triangle[i]:
            print(num, end=" ")
        print()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5  # Change this to print more or fewer rows
    print_pascals_triangle(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
```
