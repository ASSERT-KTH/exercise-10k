## Exercise
Obfuscate variables to make them difficult to understand or reverse engineer.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Obfuscated variable names
v4r1 = "username"
v4r2 = "password"

# Using abbreviations
u = "username"
p = "password"

# Concatenating strings
var = "variable"
iable = "name"
var_iable = var + iable

# Using Unicode characters
⁂ = "variable"
print(⁂)  # prints "variable"
```
