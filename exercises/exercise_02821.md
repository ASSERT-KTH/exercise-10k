## Exercise
Create a program to determine a student's grade based on their marks. If the marks are above 90, the grade is A. If the marks are between 80 and 90, the grade is B. If the marks are between 70 and 80, the grade is C. If the marks are between 60 and 70, the grade is D. If the marks are below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(marks):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the marks.

    Args:
        marks (float): The marks obtained by the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if marks > 90:
        return "A"
    elif marks >= 80 and marks <= 90:
        return "B"
    elif marks >= 70 and marks < 80:
        return "C"
    elif marks >= 60 and marks < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"


def main():
    # Get the marks from the user
    marks = float(input("Enter the marks: "))

    # Validate the marks
    if marks < 0 or marks > 100:
        print("Invalid marks. Please enter marks between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        # Calculate and display the grade
        grade = calculate_grade(marks)
        print(f"Grade: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the marks: Grade: B
```
