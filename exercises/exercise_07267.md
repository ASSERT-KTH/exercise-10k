## Exercise
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence common to both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, given the sequences 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA', the longest common subsequence is 'BCBA' and its length is 4. Your task is to write a function that takes two sequences as input and returns the length of their longest common subsequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):
    """
    This function calculates the length of the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
    
    Parameters:
    seq1 (str): The first sequence.
    seq2 (str): The second sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.
    """

    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
    # The array has (len(seq1) + 1) rows and (len(seq2) + 1) columns
    lengths = [[0] * (len(seq2) + 1) for _ in range(len(seq1) + 1)]

    # Iterate over the rows of the array
    for i in range(1, len(seq1) + 1):
        # Iterate over the columns of the array
        for j in range(1, len(seq2) + 1):
            # If the current characters in the sequences are the same, 
            # the length of the common subsequence is one more than the length of the subsequence without these characters
            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
                lengths[i][j] = lengths[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            # If the current characters are different, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum length of the subsequences without the current characters
            else:
                lengths[i][j] = max(lengths[i - 1][j], lengths[i][j - 1])

    # The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the array
    return lengths[-1][-1]

# Test the function
print(longest_common_subsequence('ABCBDAB', 'BDCABA'))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
