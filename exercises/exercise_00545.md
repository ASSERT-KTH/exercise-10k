## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the count of a specific character in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_character(input_string, char):
    """
    Returns the count of a specific character in the input string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string to search in.
        char (str): The character to count.

    Returns:
        int: The count of the specified character.
    """
    return input_string.count(char)

def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    char = input("Enter a character to count: ")
    count = count_character(input_string, char)
    print(f"The character '{char}' appears {count} times in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Enter a character to count: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp19z5up89.py", line 21, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp19z5up89.py", line 16, in main
    char = input("Enter a character to count: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
