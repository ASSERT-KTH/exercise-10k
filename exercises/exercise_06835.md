## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.

## Reference Solution
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

# Program Description:
# This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
# based on the user's choice. It handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors.

# Input Section
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Operator Input Section
operator = input("Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ")

# Calculation Section
if operator == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operator == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operator == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operator == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        exit()
else:
    print("Error: Invalid operator.")
    exit()

# Output Section
print("Result: ", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp82lmpzld.py", line 11, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 2 addition'
```
