## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a bank account and allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Use if/else statements to determine the transaction.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object with an optional initial balance.
        
        Args:
            balance (float, optional): The initial balance. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.
        
        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.
        """
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available.
        
        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.
        """
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Prints the current account balance.
        """
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Simulator")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Choose a transaction: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please choose a valid transaction.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
