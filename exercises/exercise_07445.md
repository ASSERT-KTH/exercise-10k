## Exercise
Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The program should take an array as input, iterate through each element, and return the maximum value found.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

def findmax(list):
    max = 0
    for i in list:
        if i > max:
            max = i
    return max

# Example usage:
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(findmax(list))  # Output: 5
```

## Generated Output
