## Exercise
Write a function that checks if a given year is a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given year is a leap year.

    A year is a leap year if it is perfectly divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.
    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    years = [1999, 2000, 1900, 2020, 2021]
    for year in years:
        print(f"Is {year} a leap year? {is_leap_year(year)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 1999 a leap year? False
Is 2000 a leap year? True
Is 1900 a leap year? False
Is 2020 a leap year? True
Is 2021 a leap year? False
```
