## Exercise
Create a program that creates a game character using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, character_type, strength, agility, intelligence):
        self.name = name
        self.character_type = character_type
        self.strength = strength
        self.agility = agility
        self.intelligence = intelligence

def create_character():
    print("Create Your Game Character")
    print("---------------------------")

    # Get character name
    name = input("Enter your character's name: ")

    # Get character type
    print("Select your character's type:")
    print("1. Warrior")
    print("2. Mage")
    print("3. Rogue")
    character_type_choice = input("Enter the number of your choice: ")

    if character_type_choice == "1":
        character_type = "Warrior"
        strength = 18
        agility = 12
        intelligence = 8
    elif character_type_choice == "2":
        character_type = "Mage"
        strength = 8
        agility = 12
        intelligence = 18
    elif character_type_choice == "3":
        character_type = "Rogue"
        strength = 12
        agility = 18
        intelligence = 8
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Defaulting to Warrior.")
        character_type = "Warrior"
        strength = 18
        agility = 12
        intelligence = 8

    # Get character stats
    print("Do you want to customize your character's stats?")
    print("1. Yes")
    print("2. No")
    stat_choice = input("Enter the number of your choice: ")

    if stat_choice == "1":
        strength = int(input("Enter your character's strength (1-20): "))
        while strength < 1 or strength > 20:
            print("Invalid strength value. Please enter a value between 1 and 20.")
            strength = int(input("Enter your character's strength (1-20): "))

        agility = int(input("Enter your character's agility (1-20): "))
        while agility < 1 or agility > 20:
            print("Invalid agility value. Please enter a value between 1 and 20.")
            agility = int(input("Enter your character's agility (1-20): "))

        intelligence = int(input("Enter your character's intelligence (1-20): "))
        while intelligence < 1 or intelligence > 20:
            print("Invalid intelligence value. Please enter a value between 1 and 20.")
            intelligence = int(input("Enter your character's intelligence (1-20): "))
    elif stat_choice == "2":
        pass
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Defaulting to no customization.")
        pass

    # Create character
    character = Character(name, character_type, strength, agility, intelligence)

    # Print character stats
    print("\nYour Character's Stats:")
    print("------------------------")
    print(f"Name: {character.name}")
    print(f"Type: {character.character_type}")
    print(f"Strength: {character.strength}")
    print(f"Agility: {character.agility}")
    print(f"Intelligence: {character.intelligence}")

# Run the program
create_character()
```

## Generated Output
```
