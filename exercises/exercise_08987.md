## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def char_frequency(input_str):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each character in a string.

    Args:
        input_str (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.
    """
    frequency = {}
    for char in input_str:
        if char in frequency:
            frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency[char] = 1
    return frequency

# Example usage:
def main():
    input_str = "Hello, World!"
    print(char_frequency(input_str))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
from collections import Counter

def char_frequency(input_str):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each character in a string.

    Args:
        input_str (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.
    """
    return dict(Counter(input_str))

# Example usage:
def main():
    input_str = "Hello, World!"
    print(char_frequency(input_str))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
