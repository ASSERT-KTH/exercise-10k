## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the first n powers of 2 using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_powers(n):
    """
    Calculate the first n powers of 2.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of powers to calculate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n powers of 2.
    """
    powers = []
    for i in range(n):
        power = 2 ** i
        powers.append(power)
    return powers

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of powers to calculate: "))
    powers = calculate_powers(n)
    print("The first {} powers of 2 are:".format(n))
    for i, power in enumerate(powers):
        print("2^{} = {}".format(i, power))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of powers to calculate: The first 5 powers of 2 are:
2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
```
