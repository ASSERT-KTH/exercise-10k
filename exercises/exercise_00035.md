## Exercise
Create a function that takes two integers as input and returns a list of numbers in the range from the first number to the second number (inclusive).

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_number_list(start, end):
    """
    This function generates a list of numbers from the start number to the end number (inclusive).
    
    Parameters:
    start (int): The starting number of the range.
    end (int): The ending number of the range.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive).
    """

    # First, we need to check if the start number is less than or equal to the end number.
    # If not, we need to swap them to ensure our range is correct.
    if start > end:
        # Swap the start and end numbers.
        start, end = end, start
    
    # Now, we can use the built-in list and range functions in Python to generate our list of numbers.
    # The range function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the start number up to but not including the end number.
    # So, we need to add 1 to the end number to make it inclusive.
    # The list function then converts this sequence into a list.
    number_list = list(range(start, end + 1))
    
    # Finally, we return the generated list of numbers.
    return number_list

# Test the function
print(generate_number_list(5, 10))  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
