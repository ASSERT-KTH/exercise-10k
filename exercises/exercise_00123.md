## Exercise
Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their division and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function calculates the division and remainder of two integers.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")

    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor

    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    # Get the two integers from the user
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    try:
        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpik5kkxj_.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpik5kkxj_.py", line 23, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
