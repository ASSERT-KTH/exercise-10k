## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    """
    Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.

    Args:
        nums (list): The input array of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position
    lis = [1] * len(nums)

    # Compute the lengths of LIS ending at each position
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)

    # Return the maximum length of LIS
    return max(lis)


# Example usage
def main():
    nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
    print("Length of longest increasing subsequence:", longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of longest increasing subsequence: 6
```
