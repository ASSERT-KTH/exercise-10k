## Exercise
Develop a program that generates a Mad Libs story with user-provided words. The program should ask for a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb, and then print out the completed story.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Get user input for the story."""
    print("Please provide the following words:")
    noun = input("Noun: ")
    verb = input("Verb (e.g., run, jump, read): ")
    adjective = input("Adjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): ")
    adverb = input("Adverb (e.g., quickly, loudly, wisely): ")
    return noun, verb, adjective, adverb

def generate_story(noun, verb, adjective, adverb):
    """Generate the Mad Libs story."""
    story = f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. " \
            f"Suddenly, it started to {verb} {adverb} and {verb} some more. " \
            f"The {noun} was so {adjective} that it {verb} all the way home."
    return story

def main():
    """Main function."""
    noun, verb, adjective, adverb = get_user_input()
    story = generate_story(noun, verb, adjective, adverb)
    print("\nHere is your Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please provide the following words:
Noun: Verb (e.g., run, jump, read): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpq5t8kwql.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpq5t8kwql.py", line 19, in main
    noun, verb, adjective, adverb = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmpq5t8kwql.py", line 5, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Verb (e.g., run, jump, read): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
