## Exercise
Write a program that takes the distance and speed as input and returns the time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_time(distance, speed):
    """
    Calculate the time taken to cover a distance at a given speed.

    Args:
        distance (float): The distance to be covered in kilometers.
        speed (float): The speed at which the distance is covered in kilometers per hour.

    Returns:
        float: The time taken to cover the distance in hours.
    """
    if speed == 0:
        raise ValueError("Speed cannot be zero")
    time = distance / speed
    return time

def main():
    # Get user input
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance in kilometers: "))
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed in kilometers per hour: "))

    # Calculate time
    try:
        time = calculate_time(distance, speed)
        print(f"The time taken to cover {distance} km at {speed} km/h is {time} hours")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance in kilometers: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_rbdrm23.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_rbdrm23.py", line 19, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance in kilometers: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 50'
```
