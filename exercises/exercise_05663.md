## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division result and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input, 
    divides the first number by the second, 
    and returns the result and the remainder.
    
    Args:
        dividend (float): The number being divided.
        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the division result and the remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    
    result = dividend / divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    
    return result, remainder

def main():
    # Get the input from the user
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = float(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    try:
        result, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {result} with a remainder of {remainder}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpu1oo2_m0.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpu1oo2_m0.py", line 24, in main
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '17 5'
```
