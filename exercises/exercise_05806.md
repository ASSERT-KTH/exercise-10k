## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")

    # Initialize the result variable to 1
    result = 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Multiply the result by the current number
        result *= i

    return result


def main():
    # Example usage
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {calculate_factorial(num)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
