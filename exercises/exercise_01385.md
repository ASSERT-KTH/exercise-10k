## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 11):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

print(sum_of_squares())
```

```python
def sum_of_squares():
    return sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11))

print(sum_of_squares())
```

## Generated Output
```
385
```
