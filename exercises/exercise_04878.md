## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.
    """
    i = 0  # Initialize the index variable
    total = 0  # Initialize the total sum variable

    # Loop through the list of numbers
    while i < len(numbers):
        total += numbers[i]  # Add the current number to the total sum
        i += 1  # Increment the index variable

    # Calculate the average
    average = total / len(numbers)

    return average

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print("The average of the numbers is:", average)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the numbers is: 3.0
```
