## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a tree of asterisks (*).

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_tree(height):
    """
    Prints a tree of asterisks (*) of given height.

    Args:
        height (int): The height of the tree.
    """
    for i in range(height):
        # Print leading spaces
        for j in range(height - i - 1):
            print(' ', end='')
        # Print asterisks
        for k in range(2 * i + 1):
            print('*', end='')
        print()  # Move to next line

def main():
    height = int(input("Enter the height of the tree: "))
    print_tree(height)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the height of the tree:     *
