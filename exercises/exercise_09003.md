## Exercise
Create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.
def compose(f, g):
    """
    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.

    Args:
        f (function): The first function.
        g (function): The second function.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that is the composition of f and g.
    """
    
    # We want to return a new function that takes an argument x and applies g to x, then applies f to the result.
    # So, we define a new function inside our compose function.
    def composed_function(x):
        
        # First, we apply g to x.
        intermediate_result = g(x)
        
        # Then, we apply f to the intermediate result.
        final_result = f(intermediate_result)
        
        # Finally, we return the final result.
        return final_result
    
    # We return the composed function.
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

# Compose the functions.
double_then_add_one = compose(add_one, double)

# Use the composed function.
result = double_then_add_one(5)
print(result)  # Output: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
