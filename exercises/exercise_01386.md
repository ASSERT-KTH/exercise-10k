## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should keep track of the score and announce the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'user'
    return 'computer'

def main():
    """Plays the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the user."""
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0

    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): ").lower()
        if user_choice == 'quit':
            break

        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")

        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'tie':
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif winner == 'user':
            print(f"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win this round.")
            user_score += 1
        else:
            print(f"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins this round.")
            computer_score += 1

        print(f"\nScore - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\n")

    if user_score > computer_score:
        print("You are the overall winner! Congratulations!")
    elif user_score < computer_score:
        print("The computer is the overall winner. Better luck next time!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie game! Well played!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): 
Computer chose: paper
Paper beats rock! Computer wins this round.

Score - You: 0, Computer: 1

Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): 
Computer chose: scissors
Scissors beats paper! Computer wins this round.

Score - You: 0, Computer: 2

Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): 
Computer chose: rock
Rock beats scissors! Computer wins this round.

Score - You: 0, Computer: 3
