## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should handle arrays of varying lengths and should be able to handle empty arrays by returning a specific value (e.g., null or a custom message).

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
#include "max.hpp"

int main() {
    int list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::cout << max(list) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
