## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a predicate function as input, and returns a new list that contains only the elements that satisfy the predicate function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(list, predicate):
    result = []
    for element in list:
        if predicate(element):
            result.append(element)
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
