## Exercise
Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a given string

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def first_non_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.
    """
    # Count the occurrences of each character
    char_count = Counter(s)

    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeating character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char

    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None
    return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(first_non_repeating_char("aabbc"))  # Output: c
    print(first_non_repeating_char("aabbcc"))  # Output: None
```

## Generated Output
```
c
None
```
