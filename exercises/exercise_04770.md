## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a bank account balance is sufficient to make a withdrawal. If the balance is greater than or equal to the withdrawal amount, the program prints 'Withdrawal successful'. If the balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the program prints 'Insufficient balance'.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int balance, amount, total;

    cout << "Enter your account balance: ";
    cin >> balance;

    cout << "Enter the withdrawal amount: ";
    cin >> amount;

    total = balance - amount;

    if (total >= 0) {
        cout << "Withdrawal successful" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Insufficient balance" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
