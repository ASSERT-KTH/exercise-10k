## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers entered by the user. The program should ask the user to enter a series of numbers separated by spaces and then calculate the average.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get input from user
rawNumbers = input("Enter a series of numbers separated by spaces: ")

# Split input string into a list of substrings
numbers = rawNumbers.split()

# Initialize variables
total = 0
count = 0

# Loop through list of numbers and add them to total
for number in numbers:
    total += int(number)
    count += 1

# Calculate average
average = total / count

# Print result
print("Average:", average)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a series of numbers separated by spaces: Average: 3.0
```
