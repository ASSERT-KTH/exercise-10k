## Exercise
Develop a program that takes in the current hour and prints out a greeting message. If the hour is between 6 and 11, the message should be 'Good morning!', if it's between 12 and 16, the message should be 'Good afternoon!', if it's between 17 and 20, the message should be 'Good evening!', otherwise the message should be 'Good night!'

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_greeting(hour):
    """
    Prints a greeting message based on the current hour.

    Args:
        hour (int): The current hour.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Check if the hour is between 6 and 11
    if 6 <= hour <= 11:
        print("Good morning!")
    # Check if the hour is between 12 and 16
    elif 12 <= hour <= 16:
        print("Good afternoon!")
    # Check if the hour is between 17 and 20
    elif 17 <= hour <= 20:
        print("Good evening!")
    # If the hour is not in any of the above ranges, print 'Good night!'
    else:
        print("Good night!")


def main():
    # Get the current hour from the user
    hour = int(input("Enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): "))

    # Print the greeting message
    print_greeting(hour)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): Good afternoon!
```
