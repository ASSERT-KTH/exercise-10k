## Exercise
Write a function to delete a key from a dictionary. If the key does not exist, raise a KeyError.

## Reference Solution
```python
def delete_key(dictionary, key):
    """
    Deletes a key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which to delete the key.
        key: The key to be deleted.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If the key does not exist in the dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: The modified dictionary with the key deleted.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    # If it does not exist, we raise a KeyError with a descriptive message
    if key not in dictionary:
        raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.")

    # If the key exists, we use the del statement to delete it from the dictionary
    # This will remove the key-value pair from the dictionary
    del dictionary[key]

    # Finally, we return the modified dictionary
    return dictionary

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(delete_key(my_dict, "a"))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
