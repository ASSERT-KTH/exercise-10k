## Exercise
Create a program that takes a day number (1-7) as input and uses if/else statements to determine the corresponding day of the week.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_day(day_number):
    if day_number == 1:
        return "Monday"
    elif day_number == 2:
        return "Tuesday"
    elif day_number == 3:
        return "Wednesday"
    elif day_number == 4:
        return "Thursday"
    elif day_number == 5:
        return "Friday"
    elif day_number == 6:
        return "Saturday"
    elif day_number == 7:
        return "Sunday"
    else:
        return "Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7."

day_number = int(input("Enter a day number (1-7): "))
print(find_day(day_number))
```

```python
def find_day(day_number):
    days = {
        1: "Monday",
        2: "Tuesday",
        3: "Wednesday",
        4: "Thursday",
        5: "Friday",
        6: "Saturday",
        7: "Sunday"
    }
    return days.get(day_number, "Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.")

day_number = int(input("Enter a day number (1-7): "))
print(find_day(day_number))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a day number (1-7): Wednesday
```
