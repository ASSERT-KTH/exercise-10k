## Exercise
Write a program that takes two functions as input and returns their composition. The composition of two functions f and g, denoted as (f ∘ g)(x), is defined as f(g(x)).

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose(f, g):
    def h(*args, **kwargs):
        return f(g(*args, **kwargs))
    return h

def f(x):
    return x * x

def g(x):
    return x * 2

h = compose(f, g)
print(h(1))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
```
4
```
