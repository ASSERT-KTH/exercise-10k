## Exercise
Create a function to find the inverse of a dictionary and return a new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs.

## Reference Solution
```python
def invert_dictionary(dictionary):
    """
    This function inverts a dictionary and returns a new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs.
    
    If the original dictionary has multiple keys mapping to the same value, 
    the resulting dictionary will have a list of these keys as its value.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be inverted.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inverted key-value pairs
    inverted_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the original dictionary
    for key, value in dictionary.items():
        # If the value is not already a key in the inverted dictionary, add it with the original key as its value
        if value not in inverted_dict:
            # Comment: We use a list to store the original keys in case there are multiple keys with the same value
            inverted_dict[value] = [key]
        else:
            # If the value is already a key in the inverted dictionary, append the original key to its list of values
            inverted_dict[value].append(key)

    # Return the inverted dictionary
    return inverted_dict

# Example usage:
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
print(invert_dictionary(original_dict))  # Output: {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}
```

## Generated Output
```
{1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}
```
