## Exercise
Write a program that reads a string from the user and writes it to a buffer, then reads from the buffer and prints out the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
import io

def main():
    # Read a string from the user
    user_string = input("Please enter a string: ")

    # Create a buffer
    buffer = io.StringIO()

    # Write the string to the buffer
    buffer.write(user_string)

    # Reset the buffer's position to the beginning
    buffer.seek(0)

    # Read from the buffer and print out the string
    print(buffer.read())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
