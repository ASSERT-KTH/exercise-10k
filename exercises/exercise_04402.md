## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. Use a while loop to repeat the guessing process until the user correctly guesses the number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
number_to_find = random.randrange(1, 100)

# Initialize a counter for the number of attempts
attempts = 0

# Start the game
print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

while True:
    # Ask the user for their guess
    user_guess = int(input("What's your guess? "))

    # Increment the number of attempts
    attempts += 1

    # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the correct answer
    if user_guess < number_to_find:
        print("Too low!")
    elif user_guess > number_to_find:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        # Check if the user guessed correctly on the first attempt
        if attempts == 1:
            print("You won! Congratulations!")
        else:
            print("You won!")
        print(f"It took you {attempts} attempts to guess correctly.")
        break
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
What's your guess? Too low!
What's your guess? 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqw13_zi1.py", line 15, in <module>
    user_guess = int(input("What's your guess? "))
