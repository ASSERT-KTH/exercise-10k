## Exercise
Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and their grades for three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should then calculate the average grade for each student and store it in the dictionary. Finally, the program should print out the dictionary with the student's name, grades, and average grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(grades):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of grades.
    
    Args:
        grades (list): A list of grades.
    
    Returns:
        float: The average grade.
    """
    return sum(grades) / len(grades)


def main():
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades
    student_grades = {}

    # Prompt the user to input the number of students
    num_students = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))

    # Loop through each student
    for _ in range(num_students):
        # Prompt the user to input the student's name
        name = input("Enter the student's name: ")

        # Prompt the user to input the student's grades
        math_grade = float(input("Enter the student's Math grade: "))
        science_grade = float(input("Enter the student's Science grade: "))
        english_grade = float(input("Enter the student's English grade: "))

        # Calculate the average grade
        average_grade = calculate_average([math_grade, science_grade, english_grade])

        # Store the student's grades and average grade in the dictionary
        student_grades[name] = {
            "Math": math_grade,
            "Science": science_grade,
            "English": english_grade,
            "Average": average_grade
        }

    # Print out the dictionary with the student's name, grades, and average grade
    for name, grades in student_grades.items():
        print(f"Student: {name}")
        print(f"Math Grade: {grades['Math']}")
        print(f"Science Grade: {grades['Science']}")
        print(f"English Grade: {grades['English']}")
        print(f"Average Grade: {grades['Average']:.2f}")
        print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
