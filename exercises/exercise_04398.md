## Exercise
Perform set operations using variables

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union of two sets
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print("Union of set1 and set2: ", union_set)

# Intersection of two sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print("Intersection of set1 and set2: ", intersection_set)

# Difference of two sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print("Difference of set1 and set2: ", difference_set)

# Symmetric difference of two sets
symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print("Symmetric difference of set1 and set2: ", symmetric_difference_set)

# Alternatively, you can use the following operators:
# Union: |
# Intersection: &
# Difference: -
# Symmetric difference: ^
print("Union of set1 and set2: ", set1 | set2)
print("Intersection of set1 and set2: ", set1 & set2)
print("Difference of set1 and set2: ", set1 - set2)
print("Symmetric difference of set1 and set2: ", set1 ^ set2)
```

```python
math_students = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"}
science_students = {"Bob", "Charlie", "Eve", "Frank"}

# Find the students who are enrolled in both classes
both_classes = math_students.intersection(science_students)
print("Students enrolled in both classes: ", both_classes)

# Find the students who are enrolled in only the math class
only_math = math_students.difference(science_students)
print("Students enrolled in only the math class: ", only_math)

# Find the students who are enrolled in either class
either_class = math_students.union(science_students)
print("Students enrolled in either class: ", either_class)
```

## Generated Output
```
Union of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection of set1 and set2:  {4, 5}
Difference of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3}
Symmetric difference of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Union of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection of set1 and set2:  {4, 5}
Difference of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3}
Symmetric difference of set1 and set2:  {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```
