## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on a given number of rows. The pattern should have the following structure: the first row has one asterisk, the second row has two asterisks, and so on, until the last row, which has the same number of asterisks as the row number. Use a loop to generate this pattern.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 5; // number of rows

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            std::cout << "*";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
