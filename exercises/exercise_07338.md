## Exercise
Write a program that reads input from a network socket and prints out the contents.

## Reference Solution
```python
import socket

def read_from_socket(host, port):
    # Create a socket object
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Connect to the server
    client_socket.connect((host, port))

    # Receive data from the server
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    while data:
        print(data.decode())
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)

    # Close the socket
    client_socket.close()

def main():
    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost
    port = 8080         # Arbitrary non-privileged port

    read_from_socket(host, port)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
import socket

def start_server(host, port):
    # Create a socket object
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Bind the socket to the port
    server_socket.bind((host, port))

    # Listen for incoming connections
    server_socket.listen(5)

    print(f"Server listening on {host}:{port}")

    while True:
        # Wait for a connection
        print("Waiting for a connection...")
        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()

        try:
            print(f"Connection from {client_address} has been established!")

            # Send data to the client
            data = "Hello, client!"
            connection.sendall(data.encode())

        finally:
            # Close the connection
            connection.close()

def main():
    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost
    port = 8080         # Arbitrary non-privileged port

    start_server(host, port)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
