## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a student's grade is passing or failing based on their score. If the score is 50 or above, the grade is passing; otherwise, it's failing.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade(score):
    """
    Checks if a student's grade is passing or failing based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: 'Passing' if the score is 50 or above, 'Failing' otherwise.
    """
    if score >= 50:
        return 'Passing'
    else:
        return 'Failing'

# Example usage:
def main():
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    grade = check_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: Passing
```
