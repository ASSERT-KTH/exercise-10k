## Exercise
Write a program that creates a student information system using if/else statement

## Reference Solution
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, grade):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.grade = grade

def add_student():
    name = input("Enter student name: ")
    roll_number = input("Enter student roll number: ")
    grade = input("Enter student grade: ")
    student = Student(name, roll_number, grade)
    return student

def display_student(student):
    print(f"Name: {student.name}")
    print(f"Roll Number: {student.roll_number}")
    print(f"Grade: {student.grade}")

            del students[i]
            print("Student deleted successfully")
            return
    print("Student not found")

def main():

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == "1":

        elif choice == "4":
            update_student()
        elif choice == "5":
            delete_student()
        elif choice == "6":
            break
        else:

if __name__ == "__main__":
