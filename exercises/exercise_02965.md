## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is a negative number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Example usage
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
