## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return "List is empty"
    
    # Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
    total = sum(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the average
    average = total / len(numbers)
    
    return average

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("The average of the list is:", calculate_average(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the list is: 3.0
