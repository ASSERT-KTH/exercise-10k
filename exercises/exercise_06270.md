## Exercise
Create a dictionary using a dictionary comprehension

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a list of fruits
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Create a dictionary with fruit names as keys and their lengths as values
fruit_dict = {fruit: len(fruit) for fruit in fruits}

# Print the resulting dictionary
print(fruit_dict)
```

```python
{'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}
```

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Create a dictionary with even numbers as keys and their squares as values
even_squares = {num: num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0}

# Print the resulting dictionary
print(even_squares)
```

```python
{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}
```
