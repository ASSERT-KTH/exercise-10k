## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The program should take a string as input from the user and print out whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

## Reference Solution
```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()
    return s == s[::-1]

s = input("Enter a string: ")

if isPalindrome(s):
    print(s + " is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(s + " is not a palindrome.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: radar is a palindrome.
```
