## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a mathematical operation and two numbers until the user chooses to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    while True:
        # Display available operations
        print("\nAvailable Operations:")
        print("1. Addition")
        print("2. Subtraction")
        print("3. Multiplication")
        print("4. Division")
        print("5. Quit")

        # Ask the user for an operation
        choice = input("Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5): ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if choice == "5":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        # Check if the user has entered a valid operation
        if choice not in ["1", "2", "3", "4"]:
            print("Invalid operation. Please choose a valid operation.")
            continue

        # Ask the user for two numbers
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
            continue

        # Perform the chosen operation
        if choice == "1":
            print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
        elif choice == "2":
            print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
        elif choice == "4":
            # Check for division by zero
            if num2 == 0:
                print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
            else:
                print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Available Operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Quit
Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5): Invalid operation. Please choose a valid operation.

Available Operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Quit
Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5):
