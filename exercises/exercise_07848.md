## Exercise
Create a program that analyzes a dictionary of student grades. The dictionary should have student names as keys and a list of grades as values. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name, average grade, and a message indicating whether the student is passing (average grade >= 60) or failing (average grade < 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def analyze_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    Analyze a dictionary of student grades and print out the student's name, average grade, and pass/fail status.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): Dictionary with student names as keys and a list of grades as values.
    """
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Calculate the average grade for the student
        average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)

        # Determine whether the student is passing or failing
        if average_grade >= 60:
            status = "Passing"
        else:
            status = "Failing"

        # Print out the student's name, average grade, and pass/fail status
        print(f"Student: {student}")
        print(f"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}")
        print(f"Status: {status}")
        print()  # Empty line for readability


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    grades_dict = {
        "John Doe": [80, 70, 90, 85],
        "Jane Smith": [60, 65, 70, 75],
        "Bob Johnson": [40, 50, 60, 55]
    }

    analyze_grades(grades_dict)
```

## Generated Output
```
Student: John Doe
Average Grade: 81.25
Status: Passing

Student: Jane Smith
Average Grade: 67.50
Status: Passing

Student: Bob Johnson
Average Grade: 51.25
Status: Failing
```
