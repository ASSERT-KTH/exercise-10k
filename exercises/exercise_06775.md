## Exercise
Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the computer tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number it's thinking of. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly. Use a loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they guess correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Welcome to the number guessing game!\n";
print "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n";

my $number = 55; # Change this to a random number between 1 and 100
my $guess = 0;

while ($guess != $number) {
  print "Enter your guess: ";
  $guess = <STDIN>;
  chomp $guess;

  if ($guess > $number) {
    print "Your guess is too high. Try again.\n";
  } elsif ($guess < $number) {
    print "Your guess is too low. Try again.\n";
  } else {
    print "Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly.\n";
  }
}
```
