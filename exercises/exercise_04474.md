## Exercise
Write a program to count the number of elements in a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_elements(lst, threshold):
    """
    Counts the number of elements in a list that are greater than a given threshold.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list of numbers to check.
        threshold (int): The threshold value.

    Returns:
        int: The number of elements greater than the threshold.
    """
    count = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num > threshold:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
threshold = 3
result = count_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(f"Numbers greater than {threshold}: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Numbers greater than 3: 6
```
