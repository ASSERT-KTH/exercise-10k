## Exercise
Create a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Filters a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of even integers.
    """
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)
    print("Original List:", numbers)
    print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even Numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
