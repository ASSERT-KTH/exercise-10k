## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary as input, where the keys are names of students and the values are dictionaries with keys 'age' and 'grades' (a list of grades). Calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def avg_grades(students):
    avg_dict = {}
    for student in students:
        grades = students[student]['grades']
        avg = sum(grades) / len(grades)
        avg_dict[student] = avg
    return avg_dict
```

## Generated Output
