## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_substring(string, substring):
    """
    This function finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The main string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    """

    # First, we check if the substring is empty. If it is, we return 0 as per the problem statement.
    if not substring:
        return 0

    # We use Python's built-in str.find() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.
    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
    index = string.find(substring)

    # We return the index, which is either the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found.
    return index
```
