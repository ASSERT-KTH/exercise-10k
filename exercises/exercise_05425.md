## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. If the age is above 18, the person is eligible to vote. If the age is below 18, the person is not eligible to vote.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_eligible_to_vote(age):
    """
    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.
    
    Args:
        age (int): The age of the person.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.
    """
    return age >= 18

def main():
    # Get the age from the user
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

    # Check if the person is eligible to vote
    if is_eligible_to_vote(age):
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
