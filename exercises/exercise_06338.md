## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list as input, unpacks it into separate variables, and returns the unpacked variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
def unpack_list(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list as input, unpacks it into separate variables, and returns the unpacked variables.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of elements to be unpacked.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the unpacked variables.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(input_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")

    # We use the * operator to unpack the list into separate variables. 
    # The number of variables should match the number of elements in the list.
    # For simplicity, let's assume the list has three elements.
    # If the list has more or less elements, we'll get a ValueError.
    try:
        # Unpack the list into three variables: var1, var2, var3.
        var1, var2, var3 = input_list
        
        # Return the unpacked variables as a tuple.
        # We use a tuple because it can store multiple values of different data types.
        return var1, var2, var3
    
    except ValueError:
        # If the list has more or less elements than the number of variables, we raise a ValueError.
        raise ValueError("The list must have exactly three elements.")
```
