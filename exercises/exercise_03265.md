## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested for loops to print out a pattern of asterisks (*) in the shape of a square.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_square(size):
    # Iterate over the rows of the square
    for i in range(size):
        # Iterate over the columns of the square
        for j in range(size):
            # Print an asterisk for each position in the square
            print("*", end=" ")
        # Print a newline after each row
        print()

# Test the function with a square of size 5
print_square(5)
```

## Generated Output
```
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * *
