## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers ignoring zeros

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_ignoring_zeros(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers ignoring zeros.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the non-zero numbers in the list.
    """
    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num != 0]
    if not non_zero_numbers:
        return 0
    return sum(non_zero_numbers) / len(non_zero_numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
average = calculate_average_ignoring_zeros(numbers)
print("Average ignoring zeros:", average)
```

## Generated Output
```
Average ignoring zeros: 2.5
```
