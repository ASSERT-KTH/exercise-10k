## Exercise
Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    result = gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
```

```python
import math

def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return math.gcd(a, b)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    result = gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6
```
