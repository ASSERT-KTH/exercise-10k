## Exercise
Create a function named 'calculate' that takes in two numbers and an operator as arguments, then performs the corresponding mathematical operation. The operator can be one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/'. If the operator is '/' and the second number is zero, the function should return an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(num1, num2, operator):
    """
    This function performs basic mathematical operations on two numbers.
    
    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operator (str): The mathematical operator. It can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.
    
    Returns:
        float: The result of the mathematical operation.
        str: An error message if the operator is '/' and the second number is zero.
    """

    # First, we check if the operator is valid
    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
        return "Error: Invalid operator"

    # Then, we check if the operator is '/' and the second number is zero
    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:
        # If so, we return an error message
        return "Error: Division by zero"

    # If the operator is '+', we perform addition
    if operator == '+':
        # We use the built-in '+' operator to add the numbers
        result = num1 + num2
        return result

    # If the operator is '-', we perform subtraction
    elif operator == '-':
        # We use the built-in '-' operator to subtract the numbers
        result = num1 - num2
        return result

    # If the operator is '*', we perform multiplication
    elif operator == '*':
        # We use the built-in '*' operator to multiply the numbers
        result = num1 * num2
        return result

    # If the operator is '/', we perform division
    elif operator == '/':
        # We use the built-in '/' operator to divide the numbers
        result = num1 / num2
        return result

# Example usage:
print(calculate(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12
print(calculate(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8
print(calculate(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20
print(calculate(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0
print(calculate(10, 0, '/'))  # Output: Error: Division by zero
```

## Generated Output
```
12
8
20
5.0
Error: Division by zero
```
