## Exercise
Develop a program to calculate the tax amount based on the income using conditional statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount based on the income.

    Args:
        income (float): The income amount.

    Returns:
        float: The tax amount.
    """
    if income <= 10000:
        # 0% tax on income up to $10,000
        tax = 0
    elif income <= 20000:
        # 10% tax on income between $10,001 and $20,000
        tax = (income - 10000) * 0.10
    elif income <= 50000:
        # 20% tax on income between $20,001 and $50,000
        tax = (income - 20000) * 0.20 + 1000
    else:
        # 30% tax on income above $50,000
        tax = (income - 50000) * 0.30 + 7000

    return tax

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax = calculate_tax(income)
    print(f"Your tax amount is: ${tax:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $Your tax amount is: $7000.00
```
