## Exercise
Understand how implicit type casting works by performing arithmetic operations on variables with different data types, then printing the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define variables with different data types
a = 10  # integer
b = 3.5  # float
c = "5"  # string

# Perform arithmetic operations
result1 = a + b
result2 = a + int(c)  # explicit type casting
result3 = a + float(c)  # explicit type casting

# Print the results
print("Result 1 (a + b):", result1, type(result1))
print("Result 2 (a + int(c)):", result2, type(result2))
print("Result 3 (a + float(c)):", result3, type(result3))

# Attempt to perform arithmetic operation with incompatible types
try:
    result4 = a + c
    print("Result 4 (a + c):", result4)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

## Generated Output
```
Result 1 (a + b): 13.5 <class 'float'>
Result 2 (a + int(c)): 15 <class 'int'>
Result 3 (a + float(c)): 15.0 <class 'float'>
Error: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```
