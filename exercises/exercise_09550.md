## Exercise
Create a program that stores student grades in a dictionary. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and a grade, then add the grade to the student's list of grades. If the student is not in the dictionary, the program should add the student with the given grade. The program should continue prompting the user until the user decides to stop. Finally, the program should print out the dictionary of student grades.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades
    student_grades = {}

    # Continue prompting the user until they decide to stop
    while True:
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Add a grade for a student")
        print("2. Stop and print student grades")

        # Get the user's choice
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        # If the user chooses to add a grade
        if choice == "1":
            # Get the student's name and grade
            name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
            grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade: "))

            # If the student is already in the dictionary, append the grade
            if name in student_grades:
                student_grades[name].append(grade)
            # If the student is not in the dictionary, add them with the grade
            else:
                student_grades[name] = [grade]

        # If the user chooses to stop
        elif choice == "2":
            # Print out the dictionary of student grades
            print("\nStudent Grades:")
            for name, grades in student_grades.items():
                print(f"{name}: {grades}")
            break

        # If the user enters an invalid option
        else:
            print("Invalid option. Please choose again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
