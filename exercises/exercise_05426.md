## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year or not. If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a year is a leap year.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0

def main():
    # Example usage
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
