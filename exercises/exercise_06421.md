## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_even_sum():
    """
    Calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.
    """
    even_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += i
    return even_sum

def main():
    """
    Main function to execute the program.
    """
    result = calculate_even_sum()
    print("The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2550
```
