## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The first point as a tuple of coordinates (x, y) or (x, y, z).
        point2 (tuple): The second point as a tuple of coordinates (x, y) or (x, y, z).

    Returns:
        float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.
    """
    if len(point1) != len(point2):
        raise ValueError("Both points must have the same number of dimensions")

    return math.sqrt(sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)))

def main():
    # Example usage:
    point1 = (1, 2)
    point2 = (4, 6)
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
    print(f"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is: {distance}")

    point1 = (1, 2, 3)
    point2 = (4, 5, 6)
    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
    print(f"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is: {distance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) is: 5.0
The distance between (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) is: 5.196152422706632
```
