## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using coins of different denominations and a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_ways_to_make_change(amount, coins):
    # Create a list to store the number of ways to make change for each amount from 0 to the given amount
    ways = [0] * (amount + 1)
    ways[0] = 1  # There is one way to make change for 0: use no coins

    # Iterate over each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            # The number of ways to make change for the current amount is the sum of the number of ways to make change for the current amount without using the current coin and the number of ways to make change for the amount minus the current coin
            ways[i] += ways[i - coin]

    # Return the number of ways to make change for the given amount
    return ways[amount]

# Test the function
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 5
print(count_ways_to_make_change(amount, coins))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
```
4
```
