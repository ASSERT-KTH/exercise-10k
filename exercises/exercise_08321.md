## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. The program should take an integer grade as input and output 'Pass' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Fail' otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int grade;
    scanf("%d", &grade);
    if (grade >= 50) {
        printf("Pass\n");
    } else {
        printf("Fail\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
