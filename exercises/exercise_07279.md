## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a given range, inclusive. The range is defined by a start and end value, which will be provided as input. Use a loop to iterate over the range and calculate the sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_all_numbers(start, end):
    sum = 0
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        sum += num
    return sum

start = int(input("Enter the start value: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end value: "))

result = sum_of_all_numbers(start, end)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the start value: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpfmay4jqf.py", line 7, in <module>
    start = int(input("Enter the start value: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 5'
```
