## Exercise
Write a function to remove and return the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_and_return(dictionary, key):
    """
    This function removes and returns the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which the key-value pair will be removed.
        key: The key whose associated value will be removed and returned.

    Returns:
        The value associated with the given key if it exists in the dictionary. Otherwise, None.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    if key in dictionary:
        
        # If the key exists, we store its associated value in a variable
        value = dictionary[key]
        
        # Then, we remove the key-value pair from the dictionary
        del dictionary[key]
        
        # Finally, we return the value
        return value
    
    # If the key does not exist in the dictionary, we return None
    else:
        return None

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(remove_and_return(my_dict, 'b'))  # Output: 2
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
2
{'a': 1, 'c': 3}
```
