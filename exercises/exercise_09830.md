## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then stores this information in variables. The program should then print out the data type of each variable.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Ask the user for their name and age
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = input("Please enter your age: ")

# Try to convert age to an integer
try:
    age = int(age)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid age. Please enter a whole number.")
else:
    # Store the information in variables
    user_info = {
        "name": name,
        "age": age
    }

    # Print out the data type of each variable
    print("Data type of name: ", type(name))
    print("Data type of age: ", type(age))
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Data type of name:  <class 'str'>
Data type of age:  <class 'int'>
```
