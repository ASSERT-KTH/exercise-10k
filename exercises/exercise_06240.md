## Exercise
Write a function that checks if a given matrix is symmetric, i.e., equal to its transpose.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

def is_symmetric(matrix):
    """
    Checks if a given matrix is symmetric.

    Args:
        matrix (list): A 2D list representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to ensure the input matrix is a numpy array for easier manipulation
    matrix = np.array(matrix)

    # Check if the input matrix is a 2D array
    if len(matrix.shape) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a 2D matrix")

    # Check if the matrix is square (i.e., it has the same number of rows and columns)
    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:
        return False  # A non-square matrix cannot be symmetric

    # Now, we can compare the matrix with its transpose
    # We use numpy's built-in transpose function to get the transpose of the matrix
    transpose = matrix.T

    # Finally, we compare the matrix with its transpose
    # If they are equal, the matrix is symmetric
    return np.array_equal(matrix, transpose)


# Example usage:
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]]
print(is_symmetric(matrix))  # Output: True
```

## Generated Output
```
True
```
