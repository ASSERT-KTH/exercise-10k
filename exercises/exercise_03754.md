## Exercise
Create a program to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two given numbers using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The GCD of the two numbers.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def calculate_lcm(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The LCM of the two numbers.
    """
    gcd = calculate_gcd(a, b)
    lcm = abs(a * b) // gcd
    return lcm

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp20ydg5w_.py", line 41, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp20ydg5w_.py", line 35, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[12, 18]'
```
