## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the power of a number. The function should take two arguments, the base and the exponent, and return the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_power(base, exponent):
    """
    This function calculates the power of a number.
    
    Parameters:
    base (int or float): The base number.
    exponent (int or float): The exponent to which the base is raised.
    
    Returns:
    int or float: The result of the base raised to the exponent.
    """
    
    # First, we check if the inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(base, (int, float)) or not isinstance(exponent, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both base and exponent must be numbers.")
    
    # We use the built-in pow function in Python, which can handle large numbers efficiently.
    # However, we could also use the ** operator, which is more readable and Pythonic.
    # Here, we choose to use the ** operator for simplicity and readability.
    result = base ** exponent
    
    # Finally, we return the result.
    return result

# Example usage:
print(calculate_power(2, 3))  # Output: 8
```

## Generated Output
```
8
```
