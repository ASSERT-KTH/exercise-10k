## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

## Reference Solution
```python
def levenshtein_distance(str1, str2):
    """
    Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first string.
        str2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The Levenshtein distance between the two strings.
    """
    m = len(str1) + 1
    n = len(str2) + 1

    # Create a matrix to store the Levenshtein distances between substrings
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Initialize the base cases
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Fill in the rest of the matrix
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            cost = 0 if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1] else 1
            dp[i][j] = min(
                dp[i - 1][j] + 1,      # Deletion
                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,      # Insertion
                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost  # Substitution
            )

    # The Levenshtein distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]


def main():
    # Example usage:
    str1 = "kitten"
    str2 = "sitting"
    distance = levenshtein_distance(str1, str2)
    print(f"The Levenshtein distance between '{str1}' and '{str2}' is {distance}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
