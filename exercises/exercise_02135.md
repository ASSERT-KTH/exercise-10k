## Exercise
Create a function that takes an array and a number of positions as input and returns a new array containing the same elements, but rotated by the specified number of positions.

## Reference Solution
```python
from typing import List

def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
    """
    Rotates the input list by k positions to the right.

    :param nums: The input list to be rotated.
    :param k: The number of positions to rotate the list.
    :return: None
    """
    # Calculate the effective number of rotations, considering the length of the list
    k = k % len(nums)
    
    # Reverse the entire list
    nums.reverse()
    
    # Reverse the first k elements
    nums[:k] = nums[:k][::-1]
    
    # Reverse the rest of the list (from index k to the end)
    nums[k:] = nums[k:][::-1]

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
print(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
