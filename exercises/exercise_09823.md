## Exercise
Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The user will provide the number of rows and columns for the pattern. Use loops to generate the pattern and ensure that the number of asterisks in each row corresponds to the column number. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 5 columns, the output should be a square of asterisks with 5 asterisks in each row.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Program to generate a pattern of asterisks (*)
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]

import time

# Function to generate the pattern
def pattern():
    # Get the number of rows and columns from the user
    rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
    columns = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))

    # Generate the pattern
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(columns):
            print("*", end=" ")
        print()

# Call the pattern function
pattern()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of rows: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpn0egy19a.py", line 20, in <module>
    pattern()
  File "/tmp/tmpn0egy19a.py", line 10, in pattern
    rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5 5'
```
