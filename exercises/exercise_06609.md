## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their age and then tells them how old they will be in a year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_age_in_a_year():
    """
    Asks the user for their current age and calculates their age in a year.
    """
    # Get the user's current age
    while True:
        try:
            current_age = int(input("Please enter your current age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Calculate the user's age in a year
    age_in_a_year = current_age + 1

    # Print the result
    print(f"In a year, you will be {age_in_a_year} years old.")

def main():
    calculate_age_in_a_year()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
