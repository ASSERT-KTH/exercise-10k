## Exercise
Write a program that implements the selection sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. Use a for loop to iterate over the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def selection_sort(numbers):
    # Loop through the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # Assume the first element is the smallest
        min_index = i
        
        # Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] < numbers[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        
        # Swap the smallest element with the first element of the unsorted part
        numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i]
    
    return numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", selection_sort(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
