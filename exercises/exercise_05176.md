## Exercise
Write a function to convert a list of tuples to a dictionary, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_to_dict(tuple_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.
    It returns a dictionary where the first element of each tuple is a key and the second element is its corresponding value.

    Args:
        tuple_list (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the first element of each tuple is a key and the second element is its corresponding value.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs
    result_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuple_list:
        # Check if the tuple has exactly two elements (key and value)
        if len(tup) == 2:
            # Extract the key and value from the tuple
            key, value = tup
            
            # Add the key-value pair to the dictionary
            result_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # If the tuple does not have exactly two elements, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("Each tuple must have exactly two elements (key and value)")

    # Return the resulting dictionary
    return result_dict

# Example usage:
tuple_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
print(convert_to_dict(tuple_list))  # Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
```

## Generated Output
```
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
```
