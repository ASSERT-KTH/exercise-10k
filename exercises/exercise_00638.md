## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a set of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers"""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_median(numbers):
    """Calculate the median of a list of numbers"""
    numbers.sort()
    n = len(numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        median = (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        median = numbers[n//2]
    return median

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers, mean):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers"""
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main():
    numbers = [float(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers, mean)
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: Mean: 3.0
Median: 3.0
Standard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951
```
