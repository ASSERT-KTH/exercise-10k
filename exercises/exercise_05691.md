    Args:
    num (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    str: A string indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
    """
    if num > 0:
        return "The number is positive."
    elif num < 0:
        return "The number is negative."
    else:
        return "The number is zero."

def main():
    # Get the number from the user
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Check the number
    result = check_number(num)

    # Print the result
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
