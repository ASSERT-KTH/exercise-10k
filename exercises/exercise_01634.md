## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a new list containing the squares of each number in the input list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the squares of each number.
    """
    return [n ** 2 for n in numbers]

def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)
    print("Original list:", numbers)
    print("List with squared numbers:", squared_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
List with squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
