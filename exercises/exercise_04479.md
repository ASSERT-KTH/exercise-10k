## Exercise
Write a program to find the sum of squares of elements in a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a for loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers, condition):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of elements in a list that meet a specific condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True or False.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of elements that meet the condition.
    """
    sum_squares = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if condition(num):
            sum_squares += num ** 2
    return sum_squares


# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
condition = lambda x: x > 3

result = sum_of_squares(numbers, condition)
print("Sum of squares of numbers greater than 3:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squares of numbers greater than 3: 271
```
