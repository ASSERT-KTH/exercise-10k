## Exercise
Develop a function that checks if a given year is a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given year is a leap year.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    years_to_check = [1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2100]
    for year in years_to_check:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year: {is_leap_year(year)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
1999 is a leap year: False
2000 is a leap year: True
2001 is a leap year: False
2004 is a leap year: True
2100 is a leap year: False
```
