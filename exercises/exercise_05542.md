## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of even numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    i = 1
    total = 0
    while i <= n:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
        i += 1
    return total

# Test the function
n = 20
result = sum_even_numbers(n)
print(f"The sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 20 is: 110
```
