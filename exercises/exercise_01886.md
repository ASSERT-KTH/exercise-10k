## Exercise
Understand the concept of variable scope and lifetime by creating a variable inside and outside a block

## Reference Solution
```python
# Global variable
global_variable = 10

def my_function():
    # Local variable
    local_variable = 20
    
    # Block (if statement)
    if True:
        # Variable declared inside the block
        block_variable = 30
        print("Inside block:")
        print("Global variable:", global_variable)
        print("Local variable:", local_variable)
        print("Block variable:", block_variable)
    
    # Trying to access block_variable outside the block
    try:
        print("Block variable outside block:", block_variable)
    except NameError:
        print("Error: Block variable is not accessible outside the block.")

# Calling the function
my_function()

# Trying to access local_variable outside the function
try:
    print("Local variable outside function:", local_variable)
except NameError:
    print("Error: Local variable is not accessible outside the function.")

# Accessing global_variable
print("Global variable:", global_variable)
```

## Generated Output
```
Inside block:
Global variable: 10
Local variable: 20
Block variable: 30
Block variable outside block: 30
Error: Local variable is not accessible outside the function.
Global variable: 10
```
