## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the questions, answers, and options
questions = [
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "options": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Rome"],
        "answer": 0
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
        "options": ["Earth", "Saturn", "Jupiter", "Uranus"],
        "answer": 2
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
        "options": ["Ag", "Au", "Hg", "Pb"],
        "answer": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "Who painted the Mona Lisa?",
        "options": ["Leonardo da Vinci", "Michelangelo", "Raphael", "Caravaggio"],
        "answer": 0
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the largest mammal on Earth?",
        "options": ["Blue whale", "Fin whale", "Humpback whale", "Sperm whale"],
        "answer": 0
    }
]

def ask_question(question):
    """Ask the user a question and return True if they answer correctly, False otherwise"""
    print(question["question"])
    for i, option in enumerate(question["options"]):
        print(f"{i+1}. {option}")
    
    # Get the user's answer
    while True:
        try:
            user_answer = int(input("Enter the number of your answer: "))
            if 1 <= user_answer <= len(question["options"]):
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid answer. Please enter a number between 1 and", len(question["options"]))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    
    # Check if the user's answer is correct
    return user_answer - 1 == question["answer"]

def main():
    """Ask the user a series of questions and keep track of their score"""
    score = 0
    for question in questions:
        if ask_question(question):
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print("Incorrect. The correct answer was", question["options"][question["answer"]], "\n")
    
    print("Quiz finished! Your final score is", score, "out of", len(questions))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
