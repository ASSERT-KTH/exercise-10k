## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):
    """
    Calculate the surface area of a cube given its side length.

    Args:
        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.

    Returns:
        float: The surface area of the cube.
    """
    if side_length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Side length must be greater than zero.")

    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)
    return surface_area


def main():
    # Example usage:
    side_length = float(input("Enter the side length of the cube: "))
    try:
        surface_area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)
        print(f"The surface area of the cube is: {surface_area:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the side length of the cube: The surface area of the cube is: 150.00
```
