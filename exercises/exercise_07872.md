## Exercise
Create a program that analyzes a sentence and determines the number of words, vowels, and consonants using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def analyze_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Analyzes a sentence and determines the number of words, vowels, and consonants.

    Args:
        sentence (str): The input sentence to be analyzed.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the word count, vowel count, and consonant count.
    """
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    words = sentence.split()
    word_count = len(words)
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0

    for char in sentence:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
            else:
                consonant_count += 1

    return word_count, vowel_count, consonant_count


def main():
    """
    Main function to test the analyze_sentence function.
    """
    sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
    word_count, vowel_count, consonant_count = analyze_sentence(sentence)

    print("Word Count:", word_count)
    print("Vowel Count:", vowel_count)
    print("Consonant Count:", consonant_count)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a sentence: Word Count: 2
Vowel Count: 3
Consonant Count: 7
```
