## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, print 'A', if it's between 80 and 89, print 'B', and so on.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
    score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
    str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Example usage
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
