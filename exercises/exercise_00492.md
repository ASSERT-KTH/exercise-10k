## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten_list(list_of_lists):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input, 
    and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.
    
    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Iterate over each element in the sublist
        for element in sublist:
            # Append the element to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

# Example usage:
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(flatten_list(list_of_lists))
```

```python
def flatten_list(list_of_lists):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input, 
    and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.
    
    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to flatten the list of lists
    return [element for sublist in list_of_lists for element in sublist]

# Example usage:
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(flatten_list(list_of_lists))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
