## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the number of months needed to reach a savings goal given the current savings, monthly deposit, and goal amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
<?php

function calc_months_until_goal_met($current_savings, $monthly_deposit, $goal_amount) {
  $months = 0;
  while ($current_savings < $goal_amount) {
    $current_savings += $monthly_deposit;
    $months++;
  }
  return $months;
}

// Test the function
$current_savings = 1000;
$monthly_deposit = 500;
$goal_amount = 5000;

$months_until_goal_met = calc_months_until_goal_met($current_savings, $monthly_deposit, $goal_amount);
print("It will take $months_until_goal_met months to reach your goal.");

?>
```
