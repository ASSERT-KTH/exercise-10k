## Exercise
Write a function that finds the minimum window subsequence that contains a given subsequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_window_subsequence(s, t):
    """
    Finds the minimum window subsequence that contains a given subsequence.

    Args:
    s (str): The main string.
    t (str): The subsequence to be found.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window subsequence.
    """
    def find_min_window():
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        # Initialize the base case
        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 0

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

        # Find the minimum window
        min_window = float('inf')
        min_window_start = 0
        for i in range(m + 1):
            if dp[i][n] < min_window:
                min_window = dp[i][n]
                min_window_start = i - min_window

        return s[min_window_start:min_window_start + min_window]

    return find_min_window()


# Example usage:
s = "abcde"
t = "ace"
print(min_window_subsequence(s, t))  # Output: "abcde"
```

## Generated Output
```
cde
```
