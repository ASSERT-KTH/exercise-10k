## Exercise
Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    """
    Calculate the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive numbers.")
    return length * width

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    length = 5
    width = 3
    area = rectangle_area(length, width)
    print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The area of the rectangle with length 5 and width 3 is 15.
```
