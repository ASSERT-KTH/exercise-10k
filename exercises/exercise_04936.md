## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length. The program should use the formula surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2 to calculate the surface area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):
    # This function calculates the surface area of a cube
    # input
    # side_length - a positive float or int
    # output
    # returns a positive float or int representing the surface area of the cube
    # description
    # calculates the surface area of the cube using the formula surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2

    surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2
    return surface_area

side_length = 5
area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)
print("Surface Area of the Cube is: ", area)
```

## Generated Output
```
Surface Area of the Cube is:  150
```
