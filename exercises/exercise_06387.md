## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a password and checks if it's valid. If the password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit, then it's valid

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validate a password based on the given criteria.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one digit
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        return False

    # If all checks pass, the password is valid
    return True


def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    if validate_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:")
        print("* At least 8 characters long")
        print("* Contains at least one uppercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one lowercase letter")
        print("* Contains at least one digit")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
