## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a coin flip using conditional statements and prints out the result (heads or tails).

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    # Generate a random number between 0 and 1
    flip = random.random()

    # If the number is less than 0.5, it's heads
    if flip < 0.5:
        return "Heads"
    # Otherwise, it's tails
    else:
        return "Tails"

# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result
print(coin_flip())
```

```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    # Generate a random number, either 0 or 1
    flip = random.randint(0, 1)

    # If the number is 0, it's heads
    if flip == 0:
        return "Heads"
    # Otherwise, it's tails
    else:
        return "Tails"

# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result
print(coin_flip())
```

```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    # Select between "Heads" and "Tails" randomly
    return random.choice(["Heads", "Tails"])

# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result
print(coin_flip())
```

## Generated Output
```
Tails
```
