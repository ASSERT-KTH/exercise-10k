## Exercise
Write a program that classifies a student's grade based on their score. The program should accept a score as input and output the corresponding grade. The grading scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program will ask for a score and print the corresponding grade

score = 0
grade = ""

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print("Your grade is: ", grade)

# This is the end of the program
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is:  B
```
