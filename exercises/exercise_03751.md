## Exercise
Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of the two numbers.
    """
    while b != 0:
        # Swap 'a' and 'b' and replace 'b' with the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'
        a, b = b, a % b

    return abs(a)

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18

    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6
