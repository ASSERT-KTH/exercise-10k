## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the price after tax is added given the original price and the tax percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_price_after_tax(original_price, tax_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the price after tax is added.

    Args:
    - original_price (float): The original price of the item.
    - tax_percentage (float): The tax percentage as a decimal (e.g. 8% = 0.08).

    Returns:
    - float: The price after tax is added.
    """
    tax_amount = original_price * tax_percentage
    price_after_tax = original_price + tax_amount
    return price_after_tax

def main():
    # Get the original price and tax percentage from the user
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: $"))
    tax_percentage = float(input("Enter the tax percentage (e.g. 8 for 8%): ")) / 100

    # Calculate the price after tax
    price_after_tax = calculate_price_after_tax(original_price, tax_percentage)

    # Print the result
    print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Tax Percentage: {tax_percentage * 100}%")
    print(f"Price after Tax: ${price_after_tax:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the original price: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmphkc3ljew.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmphkc3ljew.py", line 18, in main
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 8'
