## Exercise
Create a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the list of numbers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    try:
        average = calculate_average(numbers)
        print(f"The average of the list is: {average}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the list is: 3.0
