## Exercise
Write a function called 'absolute_difference' that calculates the absolute difference between two given numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def absolute_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    This function calculates the absolute difference between two given numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int or float): The first number.
        num2 (int or float): The second number.

    Returns:
        int or float: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.
    """

    # First, we need to ensure that both inputs are numbers
    if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")

    # Now, we can calculate the absolute difference using the built-in abs function
    # The abs function returns the absolute value of a number
    # We subtract num2 from num1 to get the difference, then pass it to the abs function
    difference = abs(num1 - num2)

    # Finally, we return the calculated difference
    return difference
```
