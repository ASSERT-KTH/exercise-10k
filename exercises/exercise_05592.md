    Args:
        miles (float): Distance in miles.

    Returns:
        float: Distance in kilometers.
    """
    # 1 mile is equal to 1.60934 kilometers
    kilometers = miles * 1.60934
    return kilometers

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    miles = 10
    kilometers = miles_to_kilometers(miles)
    print(f"{miles} miles is equal to {kilometers:.2f} kilometers.")
