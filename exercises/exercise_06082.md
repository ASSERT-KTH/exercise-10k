## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess a randomly generated number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_user_guess():
    """Get the user's guess and validate it."""
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
            if 1 <= guess <= 100:
                return guess
            else:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def main():
    """Run the random number guessing game."""
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the random number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    # Keep asking the user for input until they guess the number
    while True:
        # Get the user's guess
        guess = get_user_guess()
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the guess is correct
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the random number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Too high! Try again.
