## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Get a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner of the game."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play a game of rock-paper-scissors."""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == "q":
            break
        elif user_choice.lower() not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        
        print(determine_winner(user_choice.lower(), computer_choice))
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: paper

Computer wins!

Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit:
