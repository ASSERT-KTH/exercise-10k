## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a year and determines whether it is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Ask the user for a year
year = int(input("Please enter a year: "))

# Determine if it's a leap year
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

```python
# Ask the user for a year
year = int(input("Please enter a year: "))

# Determine if it's a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
