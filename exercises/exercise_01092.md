## Exercise
Write a program that takes the speed and time of travel as input and outputs the distance traveled.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_distance(speed, time):
    """
    Calculate the distance traveled given the speed and time of travel.

    Args:
        speed (float): Speed of travel in km/h.
        time (float): Time of travel in hours.

    Returns:
        float: Distance traveled in kilometers.
    """
    distance = speed * time
    return distance


def main():
    # Take user input for speed and time of travel
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed of travel in km/h: "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time of travel in hours: "))

    # Calculate and display the distance traveled
    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)
    print(f"The distance traveled is {distance} kilometers.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the speed of travel in km/h: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcsimncoe.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcsimncoe.py", line 18, in main
    speed = float(input("Enter the speed of travel in km/h: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '50 2'
```
