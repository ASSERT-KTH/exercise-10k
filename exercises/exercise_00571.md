## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the frequency of each character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_character_frequency(input_string):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.

    Args:
    input_string (str): The input string for which character frequencies are to be calculated.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    frequency_dict = {}
    for char in input_string:
        if char in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[char] = 1
    return frequency_dict

# Example usage:
def main():
    input_str = "Hello, World!"
    frequency = calculate_character_frequency(input_str)
    print("Character Frequencies:")
    for char, freq in frequency.items():
        print(f"{char}: {freq}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
from collections import Counter

def calculate_character_frequency(input_string):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.

    Args:
    input_string (str): The input string for which character frequencies are to be calculated.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    return dict(Counter(input_string))

# Example usage:
def main():
    input_str = "Hello, World!"
    frequency = calculate_character_frequency(input_str)
    print("Character Frequencies:")
    for char, freq in frequency.items():
        print(f"{char}: {freq}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Character Frequencies:
H: 1
e: 1
l: 3
o: 2
,: 1
 : 1
W: 1
r: 1
d: 1
!: 1
```
