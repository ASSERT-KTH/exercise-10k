## Exercise
Write a program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is within a valid range.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_number_in_range():
    """
    This function checks if the number entered by the user is within a valid range.
    
    The valid range is assumed to be between 1 and 100.
    """
    
    # Get the number from the user
    while True:
        try:
            num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    
    # Define the valid range
    min_valid = 1
    max_valid = 100
    
    # Check if the number is within the valid range
    if min_valid <= num <= max_valid:
        print(f"The number {num} is within the valid range of {min_valid} to {max_valid}.")
    else:
        print(f"The number {num} is not within the valid range of {min_valid} to {max_valid}.")

# Call the function
check_number_in_range()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The number 10.0 is within the valid range of 1 to 100.
```
