## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a user's name, age, and location as input and prints out a formatted string with this information. The program should handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric age values.

## Reference Solution
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
location = input("Enter your location: ")

try:
    age = int(age)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid age. Please enter a number.")
else:
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and from {location}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Enter your location: Hello, John Doe! You are 25 years old and from New York.
```
