## Exercise
Understand the scope of variables in different blocks of code.

## Reference Solution
```python
x = 10  # global variable

def foo():
    print(x)  # prints 10

foo()
print(x)  # prints 10
```

```python
def foo():
    y = 20  # local variable
    print(y)  # prints 20

foo()
# print(y)  # raises NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

```python
for i in range(5):
    j = i * 2  # block-scoped variable
    print(j)

# print(j)  # raises NameError: name 'j' is not defined
```

```python
x = 10  # global variable

def foo():
    x = 20  # local variable, shadows global variable
    print(x)  # prints 20

foo()
print(x)  # prints 10
```

## Generated Output
