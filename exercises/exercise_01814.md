## Exercise
Create a program that predicts the weather forecast based on user input, using conditional statements to determine the forecast rules

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_weather_forecast(temperature, raining, humidity):
    """
    Predicts the weather forecast based on user input.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
        raining (bool): Whether it is raining or not.
        humidity (float): The current humidity percentage.

    Returns:
        str: The predicted weather forecast.
    """
    if raining:
        return "Rainy"
    elif temperature > 25:
        return "Hot"
    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:
        return "Mild"
    elif 5 <= temperature < 15:
        return "Cool"
    elif temperature < 5:
        return "Cold"
    elif humidity > 60:
        return "Humid"
    else:
        return "Unknown"

def main():
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    raining = input("Is it raining? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"
    humidity = float(input("Enter the current humidity percentage: "))

    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature, raining, humidity)
    print(f"The predicted weather forecast is: {forecast}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
