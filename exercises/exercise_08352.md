## Exercise
Create an optimized version of the bubble sort algorithm that includes a flag to track if any swaps were made in a pass. If no swaps were made, the algorithm should terminate early. The input will be a list of integers, and the output should be the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    swapped = True
    start = 0
    end = len(nums) - 1

    while start < end and swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(start, end):
            if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
                nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[i + 1], nums[i]
                swapped = True
        end -= 1

    return nums
```
