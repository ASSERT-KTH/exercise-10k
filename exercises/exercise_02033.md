## Exercise
Create a program that determines a flight's status based on its departure and arrival times. The program should use if/else statements to determine the flight's status.

## Reference Solution
```python
from datetime import datetime

def determine_flight_status(departure_time, arrival_time, current_time):
    """
    Determine a flight's status based on its departure and arrival times.

    Args:
        departure_time (str): The flight's departure time in 'HH:MM' format.
        arrival_time (str): The flight's arrival time in 'HH:MM' format.
        current_time (str): The current time in 'HH:MM' format.

    Returns:
        str: The flight's status.
    """
    # Convert times to datetime objects for comparison
    departure_time = datetime.strptime(departure_time, '%H:%M')
    arrival_time = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, '%H:%M')
    current_time = datetime.strptime(current_time, '%H:%M')

    # Check if the flight has departed
    if current_time >= departure_time:
        # Check if the flight has arrived
        if current_time >= arrival_time:
            return "Arrived"
        else:
            return "In Flight"
    else:
        # Check if the flight is scheduled to depart today
        if departure_time > current_time:
            return "Scheduled"
        else:
            return "Departure Time Passed"

# Example usage
departure_time = "08:00"
arrival_time = "10:00"
current_time = "09:00"
print(determine_flight_status(departure_time, arrival_time, current_time))
```

## Generated Output
```
In Flight
```
