## Exercise
Write a program that reads input from stderr and prints out the contents.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

def read_from_stderr():
    """
    Reads input from stderr and prints out the contents.
    """
    # Read from stderr
    for line in sys.stderr:
        # Print the line
        print(line, end='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read from stderr
    read_from_stderr()
```

```python
import sys

def read_from_stderr():
    """
    Reads input from stdin (which is redirected from stderr) and prints out the contents.
    """
    # Read from stdin
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Print the line
        print(line, end='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read from stdin (redirected from stderr)
    read_from_stderr()
```

```python
your_program.py 2>&1
```

```python
import subprocess

def read_from_stderr(command):
    """
    Runs the given command and reads from its stderr.
    """
    # Run the command and capture its stderr
    process = subprocess.Popen(command, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
    # Read from stderr
    for line in iter(process.stderr.readline, b''):
        # Print the line
        print(line.decode('utf-8'), end='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run a command and read from its stderr
    read_from_stderr("your_command")
```

## Generated Output
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5g2hc9ar.py", line 14, in <module>
    read_from_stderr()
  File "/tmp/tmp5g2hc9ar.py", line 8, in read_from_stderr
    for line in sys.stderr:
io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable
```
