## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (Grade A), 80 <= score < 90 (Grade B), 70 <= score < 80 (Grade C), 60 <= score < 70 (Grade D), score < 60 (Grade F). Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int score;
    cout << "Enter your score: ";
    cin >> score;

    char grade = 'F';

    if (score >= 90) {
        grade = 'A';
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        grade = 'B';
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        grade = 'C';
    } else if (score >= 60) {
        grade = 'D';
    } else {
        grade = 'F';
    }

    cout << "Your grade is: " << grade << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
