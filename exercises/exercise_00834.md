## Exercise
Given a string, count the frequency of each character and return a dictionary with the characters as keys and their frequencies as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def char_frequency(string):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each character in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    frequency = {}
    for char in string:
        if char in frequency:
            frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency[char] = 1
    return frequency

# Example usage:
string = "Hello, World!"
print(char_frequency(string))
```

```python
from collections import Counter

def char_frequency(string):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each character in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    return dict(Counter(string))

# Example usage:
string = "Hello, World!"
print(char_frequency(string))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'H': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ',': 1, ' ': 1, 'W': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1, '!': 1}
```
