    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers in the list.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for num in num_list:
        total_sum += num
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print("The sum of numbers in the list is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
