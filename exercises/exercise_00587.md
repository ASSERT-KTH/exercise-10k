## Exercise
Write a program that takes two sorted arrays as input and returns a new sorted array that contains all elements from both arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    This function merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
    
    Parameters:
    arr1 (list): The first sorted array.
    arr2 (list): The second sorted array.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new sorted array containing all elements from both input arrays.
    """
    # Initialize the result array
    result = []
    
    # Initialize two pointers, one for each array
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    # Merge the two arrays into one sorted array
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            result.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Append any remaining elements from arr1
    while i < len(arr1):
        result.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1
    
    # Append any remaining elements from arr2
    while j < len(arr2):
        result.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
