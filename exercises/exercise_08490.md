## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer grade score as input and outputs a letter grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Program Description
# This program converts an integer score into a letter grade.
# It uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score.

# Get the Score
score = int(input("Enter a score: "))

# Determine the Grade
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    grade = "D"
elif score < 60:
    grade = "F"

# Print the Grade
print("Grade: " + grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a score: Grade: B
```
