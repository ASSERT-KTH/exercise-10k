## Exercise
Given a dictionary with names of months as keys and their corresponding temperatures as values, write a program to sort the dictionary by key and print the sorted dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_dict_by_key(temp_dict):
    """
    Sorts the dictionary by key and prints the sorted dictionary.

    Args:
        temp_dict (dict): A dictionary with names of months as keys and their corresponding temperatures as values.
    """
    # Sort the dictionary by key
    sorted_dict = dict(sorted(temp_dict.items()))

    # Print the sorted dictionary
    print("Sorted Dictionary:")
    for key, value in sorted_dict.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Example usage
temp_dict = {
    "July": 25,
    "January": 10,
    "April": 18,
    "October": 20,
    "March": 15
}

sort_dict_by_key(temp_dict)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sorted Dictionary:
April: 18
January: 10
July: 25
March: 15
October: 20
```
