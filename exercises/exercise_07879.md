## Exercise
Write a program that validates a password using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    """
    Validates a password based on the following conditions:
    * The password must be at least 8 characters long.
    * The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
    * The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
    * The password must contain at least one digit.
    * The password must contain at least one special character.
    
    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        print("Password must be at least 8 characters long.")
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        print("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        print("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one digit
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        print("Password must contain at least one digit.")
        return False
    
    # Check if the password contains at least one special character
    if not re.search("[^A-Za-z0-9]", password):
        print("Password must contain at least one special character.")
        return False
    
    print("Password is valid.")
    return True

# Example usage
def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    validate_password(password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
