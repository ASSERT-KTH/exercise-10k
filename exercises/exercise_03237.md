## Exercise
Write a program to find the median of two sorted arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_median(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Find the median of two sorted arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.
        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two arrays.
    """

    # Merge the two arrays into a single sorted array
    merged = sorted(arr1 + arr2)

    # Get the length of the merged array
    n = len(merged)

    # If the length is odd, the median is the middle element
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return merged[n // 2]
    # If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements
    else:
        return (merged[n // 2 - 1] + merged[n // 2]) / 2


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]

    median = find_median(arr1, arr2)
    print("Median:", median)
```

## Generated Output
```
Median: 4.5
```
