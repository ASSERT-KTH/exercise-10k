## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
    score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
    str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"


def main():
    # Take the score as input from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                break
            else:
                print("Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is: B
```
