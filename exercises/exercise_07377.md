## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The rectangle's length and width should be provided as input to the program.

## Reference Solution
```python
def area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def perimeter(length, width):
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return perimeter

length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

print("The area of the rectangle is:", area(length, width))
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is:", perimeter(length, width))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmcr9lj6w.py", line 9, in <module>
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 5'
```
