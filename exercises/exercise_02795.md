## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and a function as input, and returns the result of applying the function to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function(lst, func):
    """
    Applies a given function to the first two elements of a list, 
    then to the result and the next element, and so on.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        func (function): The function to be applied.

    Returns:
        result: The final result after applying the function to all elements.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return None

    # Initialize the result with the first element of the list
    result = lst[0]

    # Iterate over the rest of the list
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        # Apply the function to the current result and the next element
        result = func(result, lst[i])

    # Return the final result
    return result
```
