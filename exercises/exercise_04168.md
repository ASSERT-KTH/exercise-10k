## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    if (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper") or \
       (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock"):
        return "User"
    return "Computer"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        if user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nUser chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == "Tie":
            print(f"It's a tie!")
        elif winner == "User":
            print(f"User wins!")
        else:
            print(f"Computer wins!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
