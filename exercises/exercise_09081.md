## Exercise
Write a program that prompts the user for their name, age, and address, then prints out a formatted string with the provided information. The program should validate the user's age to ensure it is a positive integer.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to get the user's age
def input_age():
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
            if age < 0:
                print("Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.")
            else:
                return age
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")

# Define the main function
def main():
    # Get the user's name
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    
    # Get the user's age
    age = input_age()
    
    # Get the user's address
    address = input("Enter your address: ")
    
    # Print out a formatted string with the user's information
    print(f"You are {name}, {age} years old, and live in {address}.")

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Enter your address: You are John Doe, 30 years old, and live in 123 Main St.
