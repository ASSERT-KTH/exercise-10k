## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_proper_divisors(n):
    """Return a list of proper divisors of n"""
    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0]
    return divisors

def is_perfect_number(n):
    """Check if n is a perfect number"""
    divisors = get_proper_divisors(n)
    return sum(divisors) == n

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if is_perfect_number(num):
        print(f"{num} is a perfect number.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not a perfect number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 6 is a perfect number.
```
