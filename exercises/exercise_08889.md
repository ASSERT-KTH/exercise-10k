## Exercise
Write a program that takes the lengths of the bases and the height of a trapezoid as input and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the area of a trapezoid
def trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height):
    # The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2
    area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2
    return area

# Main function with example usage
def main():
    # Get the lengths of the bases and the height from the user
    base1 = float(input("Enter the length of the first base: "))
    base2 = float(input("Enter the length of the second base: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the trapezoid: "))

    # Calculate the area of the trapezoid
    area = trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The area of the trapezoid is: {area} square units")

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the first base: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpny8jteha.py", line 22, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpny8jteha.py", line 10, in main
    base1 = float(input("Enter the length of the first base: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '3 5 4'
```
