## Exercise
Write a function that checks if a given credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_credit_card_number(card_number):
    """
    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.

    Args:
        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert the card number to a list of integers
    card_number = [int(digit) for digit in card_number.replace(" ", "")]

    # Reverse the card number
    card_number = card_number[::-1]

    # Double every second digit
    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):
        card_number[i] *= 2
        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9
        if card_number[i] > 9:
            card_number[i] -= 9

    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid
    return sum(card_number) % 10 == 0


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    card_number = "4532015112830366"
    if validate_credit_card_number(card_number):
        print(f"The credit card number {card_number} is valid.")
    else:
        print(f"The credit card number {card_number} is not valid.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The credit card number 4532015112830366 is valid.
```
