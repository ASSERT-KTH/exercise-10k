## Exercise
Write a program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.
    """
    # Handle edge cases
    if n <= 0:
        print("Please enter a positive integer.")
        return
    
    # Initialize the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
    for i in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(f"The first {n} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:")
print_fibonacci(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
