## Exercise
Create a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a nested loop structure. The pattern should have 5 rows, and each row should have a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 up to the row number. For example, the first row should have the number 1, the second row should have the numbers 1 and 2, and so on. The outer loop should control the row number, and the inner loop should print the sequence of numbers for each row.

## Reference Solution
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()
```

```python
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Generated Output
```
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
```
