## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula (e.g. Fibonacci sequence), taking the user's input as the number of terms to generate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate a Fibonacci sequence of 'n' terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence


def main():
    # Get the number of terms from the user
    while True:
        try:
            n = int(input("Enter the number of terms to generate: "))
            if n > 0:
                break
            else:
                print("Please enter a positive integer.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

    # Generate and print the Fibonacci sequence
    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)
    print("Fibonacci Sequence:")
    print(fib_sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms to generate: Fibonacci Sequence:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
