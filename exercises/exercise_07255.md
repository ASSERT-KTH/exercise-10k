## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers based on the input size. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to the input size, and each number is separated by a space. Use loops (for/while) to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << j + 1 << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```python
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5
```
