## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a year and checks if it's a leap year. If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it's divisible by 400, then it's a leap year

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a year is a leap year.

    A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)


def main():
    # Get the year from the user
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    # Check if the year is a leap year
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
