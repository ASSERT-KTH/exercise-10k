## Exercise
Create a function that returns a closure that has access to its own scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function():
    """
    This function returns a closure that has access to its own scope.
    
    Returns:
        function: A closure with access to its own scope.
    """
    
    # Create a variable in the outer function's scope
    outer_variable = 10
    
    # Define the inner function
    def inner_function():
        # The inner function can access the outer function's scope
        nonlocal outer_variable  # Use nonlocal keyword to modify the variable from the outer scope
        
        # Print the value of the outer variable
        print("Outer variable:", outer_variable)
        
        # Modify the outer variable
        outer_variable += 1
        
        # Print the modified value of the outer variable
        print("Modified outer variable:", outer_variable)
    
    # Return the inner function as a closure
    return inner_function

# Create a closure by calling the outer function
closure = outer_function()

# Call the closure
closure()
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: 10
Modified outer variable: 11
```
