## Exercise
Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def lucas_sequence(n):
    """
    Function to generate the Lucas sequence up to the nth number.
    """
    a, b = 2, 1  # The first two numbers in the Lucas sequence
    i = 0  # Counter for the while loop
    while i < n:
        print(a, end=" ")  # Print the current number in the sequence
        a, b = b, a + b  # Update the numbers for the next iteration
        i += 1  # Increment the counter

# Call the function to print the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence
lucas_sequence(10)
```

## Generated Output
```
2 1 3 4 7 11 18 29 47 76
```
