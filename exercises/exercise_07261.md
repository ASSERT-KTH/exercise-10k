## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a string input from the user and checks if it matches a predefined output format. The format should include the user's name, age, and city, separated by commas. If the input matches the format, the program should print out a success message. Otherwise, it should print an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_io_format():
    user_io = input("Enter your name, age, and city, separated by commas: ")
    user_io_list = user_io.split(',')

    if len(user_io_list) == 3:
        print("Success: The input matches the required format.")
    else:
        print("Error: The input does not match the required format.")

check_io_format()

# Test cases
# print(check_io_format("John,25,New York"))  # This line is commented out and not executed
# print(check_io_format("Jane,30,Los Angeles"))  # This line is commented out and not executed
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name, age, and city, separated by commas: Success: The input matches the required format.
```
