## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a user's name and age as input, then outputs a greeting message with the user's name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years. The program should also handle invalid age inputs and prompt the user to enter a valid age.

## Reference Solution
```python
name = input('Enter your name: ')
age = input('Enter your age: ')

while not age.isdigit():
    print('Invalid age. Please enter a valid age.')
    age = input('Enter your age: ')

age = int(age)

age_in_five_years = age + 5

print(f'Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.')
print(f'You will be {age_in_five_years} years old in 5 years.')
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Hello, John! You are currently 25 years old.
You will be 30 years old in 5 years.
```
