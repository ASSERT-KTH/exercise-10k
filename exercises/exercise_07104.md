## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order using a basic algorithm (such as bubble sort or selection sort), and then prints the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    # Calculate the length of the array
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Iterate over the array n-1 times
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Initialize a flag to check if any swaps were made
        swapped = False
        
        # Iterate over the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        
        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    
    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
