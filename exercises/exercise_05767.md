## Exercise
Write a program that prints out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence."""
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

def main():
    """Print out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence."""
    n = 10
    fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
    print("The first {} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:".format(n))
    print(fib_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
