## Exercise
Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its surface area.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_surface_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the surface area of a sphere given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.

    Returns:
        float: The surface area of the sphere.
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")

    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return surface_area

def main():
    # Get the radius from the user
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))

    try:
        # Calculate and print the surface area
        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)
        print(f"The surface area of the sphere is {surface_area:.2f} square units.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(str(e))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the radius of the sphere: The surface area of the sphere is 201.06 square units.
```
