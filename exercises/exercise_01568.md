## Exercise
Create a function that returns a new function with its own scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining a function that will return another function.
def outer_function():
    """
    This function returns a new function with its own scope.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function with its own scope.
    """
    
    # We define a variable inside the outer function to demonstrate it's not accessible from the outer scope.
    outer_variable = "I'm in the outer function's scope"
    
    # Now, we define the inner function that will be returned by the outer function.
    def inner_function():
        # We define a variable inside the inner function to demonstrate it has its own scope.
        inner_variable = "I'm in the inner function's scope"
        
        # We print the inner variable to show it's accessible within the inner function's scope.
        print(inner_variable)
        
        # We try to print the outer variable to show it's accessible from the inner function's scope.
        print(outer_variable)
    
    # Finally, we return the inner function.
    return inner_function

# We call the outer function to get the inner function.
new_function = outer_function()

# We call the new function to execute its code.
new_function()
```

## Generated Output
```
I'm in the inner function's scope
I'm in the outer function's scope
```
