## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value. The program should iterate over the list to find the maximum value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = find_max(numbers)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
