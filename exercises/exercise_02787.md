## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list, an index, and a new element as input, and inserts the new element at the specified index.

## Reference Solution
```python
def insert_element(lst, index, new_element):
    """
    Inserts a new element at a specified index in a given list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The original list.
        index (int): The index where the new element will be inserted.
        new_element: The new element to be inserted.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with the new element inserted.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list. 
    # If it's not, we'll raise an IndexError with a descriptive message.
    if index < 0 or index > len(lst):
        raise IndexError("Index out of range")

    # Now, we can use list slicing to split the list into two parts at the specified index.
    # The part before the index will be stored in 'before', and the part after the index will be stored in 'after'.
    # This is done to make room for the new element at the specified index.
    before = lst[:index]  
    # The 'after' part starts from the index to the end of the list.
    after = lst[index:]  

    # Now, we can combine the 'before' part, the new element, and the 'after' part to form the modified list.
    # We use the '+' operator to concatenate these parts into a single list.
    modified_list = before + [new_element] + after  

    # Finally, we return the modified list.
    return modified_list

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 5]
print(insert_element(my_list, 3, 4))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
