## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input and then validates the age. If the age is less than 18, print 'You are a minor.' If the age is 18 or above, print 'You are an adult.' Then, echo back the user's name and age. Ensure that the age is a positive integer.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_age():
    """
    This function takes a user's name and age as input, validates the age,
    and then prints out whether the user is a minor or an adult.
    It also echoes back the user's name and age.
    """
    
    # Take user's name as input
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    
    # Take user's age as input and validate it
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if age <= 0:
                print("Age must be a positive integer.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Age must be a positive integer.")
    
    # Validate the age and print whether the user is a minor or an adult
    if age < 18:
        print('You are a minor.')
    else:
        print('You are an adult.')
    
    # Echo back the user's name and age
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Call the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    validate_age()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: You are an adult.
Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
