## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs the first number raised to the power of the second number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Course: CS 111
# Assignment: [Assignment Name]
# Purpose: Calculate the power of a number

def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** exponent

num1 = int(input("Enter the base number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the exponent: "))

result = power(num1, num2)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_01r2uqz.py", line 9, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the base number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 3'
