## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the percentage increase given the original value and new value. The program should use the formula percentage_increase = ((new - original) / original) * 100 to calculate the percentage increase.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_percentage_increase(original, new):
    """
    Calculate the percentage increase given the original value and new value.

    Args:
        original (float): The original value.
        new (float): The new value.

    Returns:
        float: The percentage increase.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the original value is zero.
    """
    if original == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Original value cannot be zero")

    percentage_increase = ((new - original) / original) * 100
    return percentage_increase


def main():
    # Example usage
    original_value = 100
    new_value = 120

    try:
        percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(original_value, new_value)
        print(f"The percentage increase from {original_value} to {new_value} is {percentage_increase:.2f}%")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The percentage increase from 100 to 120 is 20.00%
```
