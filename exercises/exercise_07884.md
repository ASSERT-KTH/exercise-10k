## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. If the grade is above 50, the student passes. Otherwise, the student fails. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade(grade):
    """
    Checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade.

    Args:
        grade (float): The student's grade.

    Returns:
        str: The outcome of the student's grade.
    """
    if grade >= 50:
        return "Pass"
    else:
        return "Fail"

# Test the function
grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade: "))
print(f"The student has {check_grade(grade)}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's grade: The student has Pass.
```
