## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate the error that occurs when trying to perform an operation on variables of incompatible data types.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define variables of different data types
a = 10  # integer
b = "20"  # string
c = 3.5  # float
d = [1, 2, 3]  # list
e = {"x": 1, "y": 2}  # dictionary

# Attempt to perform arithmetic operations on incompatible data types
try:
    print("Adding integer and string: ", a + b)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot add integer and string. Error message: ", e)

try:
    print("Adding integer and list: ", a + d)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot add integer and list. Error message: ", e)

try:
    print("Adding integer and dictionary: ", a + e)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot add integer and dictionary. Error message: ", e)

# Successful operations for comparison
print("Adding integer and float: ", a + c)

# Attempt to perform arithmetic operations on incompatible data types
try:
    print("Adding string and list: ", b + d)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot add string and list. Error message: ", e)

try:
    print("Adding string and dictionary: ", b + e)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot add string and dictionary. Error message: ", e)
```

## Generated Output
```
Error: Cannot add integer and string. Error message:  unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
Error: Cannot add integer and list. Error message:  unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp4vmi8c8l.py", line 20, in <module>
    print("Adding integer and dictionary: ", a + e)
NameError: name 'e' is not defined
