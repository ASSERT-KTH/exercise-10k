## Exercise
Write a program that creates an employee management system using if/else statement

## Reference Solution
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age, department, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.department = department
        self.salary = salary

class EmployeeManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, name, age, department, salary):
        employee = Employee(name, age, department, salary)
        self.employees.append(employee)
        print(f"Employee {name} added successfully.")

    def delete_employee(self, name):
        for employee in self.employees:
            if employee.name == name:
                self.employees.remove(employee)
                print(f"Employee {name} deleted successfully.")
                return
        print(f"Employee {name} not found.")

    def update_employee(self, name, attribute, value):
        for employee in self.employees:
            if employee.name == name:
                if attribute == "name":
                    employee.name = value
                elif attribute == "age":
                    employee.age = int(value)
                elif attribute == "department":
                    employee.department = value
                elif attribute == "salary":
                    employee.salary = float(value)
                print(f"Employee {name} updated successfully.")
                return
        print(f"Employee {name} not found.")

    def display_employees(self):
        if len(self.employees) == 0:
            print("No employees found.")
        else:
            for employee in self.employees:
                print(f"Name: {employee.name}")
                print(f"Age: {employee.age}")
                print(f"Department: {employee.department}")
                print(f"Salary: {employee.salary}")
                print("-------------------------")

def main():
    system = EmployeeManagementSystem()

    while True:
        print("\nEmployee Management System Menu:")
        print("1. Add Employee")
        print("2. Delete Employee")
        print("3. Update Employee")
        print("4. Display Employees")
        print("5. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            name = input("Enter employee name: ")
            age = input("Enter employee age: ")
            department = input("Enter employee department: ")
            salary = input("Enter employee salary: ")
            system.add_employee(name, age, department, salary)
        elif choice == "2":
            name = input("Enter employee name: ")
            system.delete_employee(name)
        elif choice == "3":
            name = input("Enter employee name: ")
            attribute = input("Enter attribute to update (name, age, department, salary): ")
            value = input("Enter new value: ")
            system.update_employee(name, attribute, value)
        elif choice == "4":
            system.display_employees()
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting the system. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
