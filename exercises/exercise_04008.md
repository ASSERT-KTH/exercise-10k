## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to sum all the even numbers from 1 to 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers():
    """
    Sums all the even numbers from 1 to 10.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def main():
    result = sum_even_numbers()
    print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
