## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second.

## Reference Solution
```python
def power(base, exponent):
    """
    Calculate the result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

    Args:
        base (float): The base number.
        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.
    """
    return base ** exponent


def main():
    # Get the base and exponent from the user
    base = float(input("Enter the base number: "))
    exponent = float(input("Enter the exponent: "))

    # Calculate and print the result
    result = power(base, exponent)
    print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp10lt_eh5.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp10lt_eh5.py", line 17, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
