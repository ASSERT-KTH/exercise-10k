## Exercise
Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation. The program should then use these functions to calculate and print the result of a series of operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the functions
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    return x / y

# Calculate and print the results
print(add(5, 2))
print(subtract(5, 2))
print(multiply(5, 2))
print(divide(5, 2))
```

## Generated Output
```
