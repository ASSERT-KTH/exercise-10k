## Exercise
Create a program that generates an arithmetic progression with a given first term, common difference, and number of terms.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms):
    """
    Generate an arithmetic progression.

    Parameters:
    first_term (float): The first term of the progression.
    common_difference (float): The difference between each term in the progression.
    num_terms (int): The number of terms in the progression.

    Returns:
    list: A list of numbers representing the arithmetic progression.
    """
    if num_terms <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of terms must be a positive integer.")

    progression = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(num_terms)]
    return progression


def main():
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
    common_difference = float(input("Enter the common difference: "))
    num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    try:
        progression = generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)
        print("Arithmetic Progression:")
        print(progression)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first term: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwxbduxj0.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwxbduxj0.py", line 21, in main
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1, 2, 5'
```
