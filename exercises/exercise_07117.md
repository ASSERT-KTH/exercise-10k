## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer grade score as input and uses conditional statements to determine the corresponding letter grade. The grade ranges are: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
grade = 85

if grade >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif grade >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif grade >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif grade >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
B
```
