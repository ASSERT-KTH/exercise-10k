## Exercise
Create a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two integers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first integer.
        num2 (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return abs(num1 - num2)


def main():
    # Take two integers as input
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

    # Calculate and print the difference
    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)
    print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is: {difference}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first integer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpo3qxr3uf.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpo3qxr3uf.py", line 17, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 4'
```
