## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student passed or failed. The passing grade is 50. If the grade is above 50, print 'Passed'. If the grade is 50 or below, print 'Failed'. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade():
    """
    Asks the user for their grade, then checks if it's a passing grade.
    Prints 'Passed' if the grade is above 50, 'Failed' otherwise.
    """
    # Ask the user for their grade
    grade = float(input("Enter your grade: "))

    # Check if the grade is above 50
    if grade > 50:
        print("Passed")
    else:
        print("Failed")

# Call the function to start the program
check_grade()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your grade: Passed
```
