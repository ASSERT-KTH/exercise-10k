## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a simple chatbot, where the user can ask the bot a question and the program provides a pre-defined answer

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary with questions and answers
chatbot_answers = {
    "hello": "Hi! How can I assist you today?",
    "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
    "what is your name": "My name is SimpleChatBot",
    "what can you do": "I can answer your questions and provide information on various topics",
    "default": "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?"
}

def get_answer(question):
    """
    Returns the answer to a given question.

    Args:
        question (str): The user's question.

    Returns:
        str: The chatbot's answer.
    """
    question = question.lower()  # Convert the question to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    for key in chatbot_answers:
        if key in question:
            return chatbot_answers[key]
    return chatbot_answers["default"]

def main():
    print("Welcome to SimpleChatBot!")
    while True:
        user_question = input("You: ")
        if user_question.lower() == "quit":
            print("SimpleChatBot: Goodbye!")
            break
        print("SimpleChatBot: ", get_answer(user_question))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to SimpleChatBot!
You: SimpleChatBot:  Hi! How can I assist you today?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpe7il069q.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpe7il069q.py", line 29, in main
    user_question = input("You: ")
