## Exercise
Create a program that takes a username as input and checks if it is valid based on the following criteria: the username should have at least 3 characters, should not have any spaces, and should not contain any special characters using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_valid_username(username):
    """
    Checks if a username is valid.

    Args:
        username (str): The username to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the username is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the username has at least 3 characters
    if len(username) < 3:
        return False

    # Check if the username has any spaces
    if ' ' in username:
        return False

    # Check if the username contains any special characters
    if not username.isalnum():
        return False

    # If all checks pass, the username is valid
    return True


def main():
    # Get the username from the user
    username = input("Enter a username: ")

    # Check if the username is valid
    if is_valid_username(username):
        print("The username is valid.")
    else:
        print("The username is not valid. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
