## Exercise
Write a program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game rules"""
    if player_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (player_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (player_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "Player wins!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        player_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: ").lower()
        if player_choice == 'q':
            break
        elif player_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nPlayer chose: {player_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: Invalid choice. Please try again.
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit:

    player_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: ").lower()
