## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to find the minimum number in a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_minimum(numbers):
    """
    This function finds the minimum number in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number in the list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")

    # Initialize the minimum number with the first number in the list
    minimum = numbers[0]

    # Iterate through the list to find the minimum number
    for num in numbers:
        if num < minimum:
            minimum = num

    return minimum

# Example usage
numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]
print("Minimum number in the list:", find_minimum(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Minimum number in the list: 7
```
