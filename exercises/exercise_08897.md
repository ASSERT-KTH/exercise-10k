## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the GCD
    print("The greatest common divisor of {} and {} is {}.".format(num1, num2, gcd(num1, num2)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmih79p5y.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmih79p5y.py", line 18, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 18'
```
