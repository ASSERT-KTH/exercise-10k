## Exercise
Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages

## Reference Solution

# Define the dictionary
student_ages = {
    "John": 18,
    "Alice": 20,
    "Bob": 19,
    "Eve": 21,
    "Mike": 18
}

# Example usage:
def main():
    # Print the entire dictionary
    print("Student Ages:")
    for name, age in student_ages.items():
        print(f"{name}: {age}")

    # Access a specific student's age
    print(f"\nJohn's age: {student_ages['John']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
