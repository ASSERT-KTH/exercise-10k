## Exercise
Write a program to sort a list of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    """
    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of integers.
    """
    # Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying it in-place
    nums_copy = nums.copy()

    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(nums_copy)

    # Iterate over the list n-1 times
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made in the current iteration
        swapped = False

        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if nums_copy[j] > nums_copy[j + 1]:
                # Swap the elements
                nums_copy[j], nums_copy[j + 1] = nums_copy[j + 1], nums_copy[j]
                # Set the flag to True
                swapped = True

        # If no swaps were made in the current iteration, the list is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    # Return the sorted list
    return nums_copy


# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
