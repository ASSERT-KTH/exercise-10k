## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a title (i.e., the first character of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase), False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_title(s):
    """
    Checks if a given string is a title.
    
    A string is considered a title if the first character of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string to be checked.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the string is a title, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Iterate over each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # If the word is empty, it's not a title
        if not word:
            return False
        
        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase
        if not (word[0].isupper() and word[1:].islower()):
            return False
    
    # If we've checked all words and haven't returned False, the string is a title
    return True
```
