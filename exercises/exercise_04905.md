## Exercise
Write a program that takes a year as input and prints whether it is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    """
    Returns True if the given year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    if year % 4 != 0:
        return False
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True

def main():
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
