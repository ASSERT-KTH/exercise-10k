## Exercise
Write a function that filters out elements from a list that do not meet a specified condition based on their index.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_by_index(lst, condition):
    """
    Filters out elements from a list that do not meet a specified condition based on their index.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes an index and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the elements that meet the specified condition.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered elements
    filtered_list = []

    # Iterate over the input list with both index and value
    for i, val in enumerate(lst):
        
        # Check if the current index meets the specified condition
        if condition(i):
            
            # If the condition is met, append the current element to the filtered list
            filtered_list.append(val)

    # Return the filtered list
    return filtered_list

# Example usage:
# Define a condition function that checks if an index is even
def is_even(index):
    return index % 2 == 0

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(filter_by_index(numbers, is_even))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 3, 5]
```
