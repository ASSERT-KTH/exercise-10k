## Exercise
Write a Python program that takes a dictionary as input, where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has no grades, the program should print a message indicating that.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Introduction and Problem Statement
# This program calculates the average grade for each student in a dictionary.

# Input Dictionary
students = {
    "Alice": {"Math": 90, "Science": 85, "English": 95},
    "Bob": {"Math": 70, "Science": 75, "English": 80},
    "Charlie": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 95},
    "David": {}  # No grades for David
}

# Looping Through the Input Dictionary
for student, grades in students.items():
    if not grades:
        print(f"{student} has no grades.")
    else:
        average = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
        print(f"{student}'s average grade is {average}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Alice's average grade is 90.0.
Bob's average grade is 75.0.
Charlie's average grade is 90.0.
David has no grades.
```
