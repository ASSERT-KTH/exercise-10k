## Exercise
Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. The function should take in an array of integers as input and return an array of the next greater elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import deque

def next_greater_element(nums):
    stack = deque()
    res = [-1] * len(nums)
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
            res[stack.pop()] = nums[i]
        stack.append(i)
    
    return res

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 1, -1]
print(next_greater_element(nums))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
```

## Generated Output
```
[-1, -1, -1]
```
