    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the squared values.
    """
    return [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)
    print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
