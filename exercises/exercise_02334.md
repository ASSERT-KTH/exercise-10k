## Exercise
Write a program to take a user's name and age as input and print a greeting message with their name and age, but handle any errors that may occur during input and validation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Libraries
import sys

# Defining a Function
def get_user_input():
    try:
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

        # Validation
        if age < 0:
            print("Age cannot be negative.")
            return get_user_input()  # recursive call to prompt user again

        return name, age
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
        return get_user_input()  # recursive call to prompt user again
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nGoodbye!")
        sys.exit()  # exit the program
    except EOFError:
        print("\nGoodbye!")
        sys.exit()  # exit the program

# Main Program
name, age = get_user_input()
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Quitting the Program
sys.exit()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
```
