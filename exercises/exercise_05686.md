## Exercise
Write a program that takes a password as input and checks if it's valid using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password(password):
    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        print("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.")
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.")
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one digit
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least one digit.")
        return False

    # Check if password contains at least one special character
    special_chars = "!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:'<>,./?"
    if not any(char in special_chars for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least one special character.")
        return False

    print("Password is valid.")
    return True

def main():
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    check_password(password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your password: Password should contain at least one special character.
```
