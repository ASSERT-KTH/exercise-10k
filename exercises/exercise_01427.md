## Exercise
Create a function that takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array. If the element is not found, return -1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def first_occurrence(array, element):
    for index, value in enumerate(array):
        if value == element:
            return index
    return -1

# Example usage:
array = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
element = 23
index = first_occurrence(array, element)
print(index)  # Output: 5
```

## Generated Output
```
5
```
