## Exercise
Create a program that takes in two integers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the operation and returns the result. The program should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the operation is not one of these four, the program should return an error message. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, the program should also return an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    if operation == "+":
        print("The result of", num1, "+", num2, "is", num1 + num2)
    elif operation == "-":
        print("The result of", num1, "-", num2, "is", num1 - num2)
    elif operation == "*":
        print("The result of", num1, "*", num2, "is", num1 * num2)
    elif operation == "/":
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        else:
            print("The result of", num1, "/", num2, "is", num1 / num2)
    else:
        print("Error: Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmwm48p5k.py", line 21, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmwm48p5k.py", line 2, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 3 +'
```
