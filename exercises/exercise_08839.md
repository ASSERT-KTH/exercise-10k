## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements in the first list, and then computes the element-wise sum of the reversed list and the second list. If the lists are not of the same length, the function should append the remaining elements from the longer list to the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_and_sum(list1, list2):
    """
    This function takes two lists of integers, reverses the first list, 
    computes the element-wise sum of the reversed list and the second list, 
    and appends any remaining elements from the longer list to the result.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list of integers.
        list2 (list): The second list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the element-wise sum of the reversed first list and the second list.
    """

    # First, we need to reverse the order of the elements in the first list
    reversed_list1 = list1[::-1]
    
    # Then, we find the minimum length between the two lists
    min_length = min(len(reversed_list1), len(list2))
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # We iterate over the range of the minimum length
    for i in range(min_length):
        # For each index, we calculate the sum of the corresponding elements from both lists
        result.append(reversed_list1[i] + list2[i])
    
    # If the lists are not of the same length, we append the remaining elements from the longer list
    if len(reversed_list1) > len(list2):
        # If the first list is longer, we append its remaining elements
        result += reversed_list1[min_length:]
    elif len(list2) > len(reversed_list1):
        # If the second list is longer, we append its remaining elements
        result += list2[min_length:]
    
    # Finally, we return the result
    return result
