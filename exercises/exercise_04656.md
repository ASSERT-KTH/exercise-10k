## Exercise
Create a program that displays the weather forecast. The user can choose the location, and the program displays the current weather conditions.

## Reference Solution
```python
import requests
import json

def get_weather(api_key, location):
    """
    Fetch the current weather conditions for a given location.

    Args:
        api_key (str): The OpenWeatherMap API key.
        location (str): The city or zip code of the location.

    Returns:
        dict: The current weather conditions.
    """
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        "q": location,
        "appid": api_key,
        "units": "metric"
    }
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    return response.json()

def display_weather(weather):
    """
    Display the current weather conditions.

    Args:
        weather (dict): The current weather conditions.
    """
    print(f"Location: {weather['name']}")
    print(f"Weather Condition: {weather['weather'][0]['description']}")
    print(f"Temperature: {weather['main']['temp']}°C")
    print(f"Humidity: {weather['main']['humidity']}%")
    print(f"Wind Speed: {weather['wind']['speed']} m/s")

def main():
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"  # replace with your API key
    location = input("Enter the city or zip code: ")
    weather = get_weather(api_key, location)
    display_weather(weather)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the city or zip code: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzzoq5coo.py", line 44, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpzzoq5coo.py", line 41, in main
    display_weather(weather)
  File "/tmp/tmpzzoq5coo.py", line 31, in display_weather
    print(f"Location: {weather['name']}")
KeyError: 'name'
```
