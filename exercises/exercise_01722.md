## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)
```

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of even numbers: 12
```
