## Exercise
Given two dictionaries with names of students as keys and their grades as values, write a program to find the intersection of the two dictionaries and print the resulting dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def intersect_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function finds the intersection of two dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the intersection of dict1 and dict2.
    """
    # Use dictionary comprehension to find the intersection
    intersection = {key: value for key, value in dict1.items() if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value}
    
    return intersection

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define two dictionaries
    students_grades1 = {
        "John": 85,
        "Alice": 90,
        "Bob": 78,
        "Charlie": 92
    }
    
    students_grades2 = {
        "John": 85,
        "Alice": 90,
        "Bob": 80,
        "David": 88
    }
    
    # Find the intersection of the two dictionaries
    intersection = intersect_dictionaries(students_grades1, students_grades2)
    
    # Print the resulting dictionary
    print("Intersection of the two dictionaries:")
    for student, grade in intersection.items():
        print(f"{student}: {grade}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Intersection of the two dictionaries:
John: 85
Alice: 90
```
