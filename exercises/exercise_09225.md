## Exercise
Write a program that takes two integers as input from the user and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Validate the user input to ensure it is an integer and handle division by zero errors. Print the results in a formatted manner.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

# Import the sys module
import sys

# Get the first integer from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))

# Get the second integer from the user
num2 = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_val = num1 + num2

# Calculate the difference
diff_val = num1 - num2

# Calculate the product
prod_val = num1 * num2

# Check if num2 is zero before calculating the quotient
if num2 == 0:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    sys.exit()
else:
    quot_val = num1 / num2

# Print the results
print("Sum:", sum_val)
print("Difference:", diff_val)
print("Product:", prod_val)
print("Quotient:", quot_val)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first integer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpx6tnpaa4.py", line 8, in <module>
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 2'
```
