## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score. Use if/else statements to determine the correct answer.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to ask questions and keep track of score
def quiz():
    score = 0
    total_questions = 5

    # Question 1
    print("What is the capital of France?")
    print("A) Berlin")
    print("B) Paris")
    print("C) London")
    print("D) Rome")
    answer1 = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
    if answer1.upper() == "B":
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Paris\n")

    # Question 2
    print("Which planet is the largest in our solar system?")
    print("A) Earth")
    print("B) Saturn")
    print("C) Jupiter")
    print("D) Uranus")
    answer2 = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
    if answer2.upper() == "C":
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is C) Jupiter\n")

    # Question 3
    print("Who wrote the famous novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?")
    print("A) F. Scott Fitzgerald")
    print("B) Harper Lee")
    print("C) Jane Austen")
    print("D) J.K. Rowling")
    answer3 = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
    if answer3.upper() == "B":
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Harper Lee\n")

    # Question 4
    print("What is the chemical symbol for gold?")
    print("A) Ag")
    print("B) Au")
    print("C) Hg")
    print("D) Pb")
    answer4 = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
    if answer4.upper() == "B":
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Au\n")

    # Question 5
    print("Who painted the famous artwork 'The Starry Night'?")
    print("A) Leonardo da Vinci")
    print("B) Vincent van Gogh")
    print("C) Claude Monet")
    print("D) Pablo Picasso")
    answer5 = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
    if answer5.upper() == "B":
        print("Correct!\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Vincent van Gogh\n")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {total_questions}")

# Call the quiz function
quiz()
```
