## Exercise
Create a function to check if a given number is a perfect number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_perfect_number(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a perfect number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is perfect, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 1:
        return False

    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors
    divisor_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)

    # Check if the sum of proper divisors is equal to the number
    return divisor_sum == n


# Example usage
def main():
    numbers = [6, 28, 12, 496]
    for num in numbers:
        if is_perfect_number(num):
            print(f"{num} is a perfect number")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is not a perfect number")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
6 is a perfect number
28 is a perfect number
12 is not a perfect number
496 is a perfect number
```
