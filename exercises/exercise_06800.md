## Exercise
Write a program that sorts a list of books based on their titles. The books are represented as strings in the format 'title,author'. The program should take a list of books as input, sort them alphabetically by title, and then print out the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_books(books):
    sorted_books = sorted(books, key=lambda book: book.split(',')[0])
    return sorted_books

books = [
    "To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee",
    "1984,George Orwell",
    "Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen",
    "The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë"
]

sorted_books = sort_books(books)

for book in sorted_books:
    print(book)
```

```python
1984,George Orwell
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë
Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald
To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee
