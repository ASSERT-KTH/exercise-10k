## Exercise
Write a function that returns another function with a closed-over variable

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    Returns a function with a closed-over variable.

    Args:
        outer_variable (any): The variable to be closed over.

    Returns:
        function: A function that has access to the outer_variable.
    """
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        """
        A function with access to the outer_variable.

        Args:
            inner_variable (any): A variable passed to the inner function.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple containing the outer_variable and inner_variable.
        """
        return outer_variable, inner_variable

    return inner_function


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a new function with a closed-over variable
    new_function = outer_function("Hello, ")

    # Call the new function with an inner variable
    result = new_function("World!")

    # Print the result
    print(result)  # Output: ("Hello, ", "World!")
```

## Generated Output
```
('Hello, ', 'World!')
```
