## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses another loop to print out the numbers from 10 to 1. Use a for loop for the first part and a while loop for the second part.

## Reference Solution
```python
# First loop: print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

# Second loop: print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop
i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
```
