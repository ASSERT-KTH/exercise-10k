## Exercise
Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list, but only if the list contains at least one positive number. If the list does not contain any positive numbers, the function should return the product of all the numbers in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_or_product(lst):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all numbers in a list if it contains at least one positive number.
    If the list does not contain any positive numbers, it returns the product of all numbers in the list.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum or product of the numbers in the list.
    """

    # First, we check if the list contains at least one positive number
    has_positive = any(num > 0 for num in lst)
    
    # If the list contains at least one positive number, we calculate the sum
    if has_positive:
        # We use the built-in sum function to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list
        result = sum(lst)
    else:
        # If the list does not contain any positive numbers, we calculate the product
        # We use the math.prod function to calculate the product of all numbers in the list
        # However, this function is available only in Python 3.8 and later versions
        # For earlier versions, we can use the functools.reduce function with the operator.mul function
        import math
        result = math.prod(lst)
    
    # Finally, we return the calculated result
    return result
```
