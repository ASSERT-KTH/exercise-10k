## Exercise
Write a function that takes in two lists and returns True if the first list is a subset of the second, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_subset(list1, list2):
    """
    This function checks if the first list is a subset of the second list.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): The list to be checked as a subset.
        list2 (list): The list to be checked against.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if list1 is a subset of list2, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # We use the built-in set.issubset() method in Python, which returns True if all elements of the first set are present in the second set.
    # However, this method works with sets, not lists. So, we convert our lists to sets first.
    # We do this because sets in Python have an average case time complexity of O(1) for lookup operations, making them ideal for this problem.
    set1 = set(list1)
    
    # Similarly, we convert the second list to a set.
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Now, we use the issubset() method to check if set1 is a subset of set2.
    return set1.issubset(set2)
```
