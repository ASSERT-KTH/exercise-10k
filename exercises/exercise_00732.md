## Exercise
Write a program that takes the scores of a student in three subjects as input and outputs their total score and average score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate total and average scores
def calculate_scores():
    # Get scores from user
    score1 = float(input("Enter score in subject 1: "))
    score2 = float(input("Enter score in subject 2: "))
    score3 = float(input("Enter score in subject 3: "))

    # Calculate total score
    total_score = score1 + score2 + score3

    # Calculate average score
    average_score = total_score / 3

    # Print total and average scores
    print(f"Total score: {total_score}")
    print(f"Average score: {average_score}")

# Call the function
calculate_scores()
```

```python
Enter score in subject 1: 80
Enter score in subject 2: 90
Enter score in subject 3: 70
```

```python
Total score: 240.0
Average score: 80.0
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter score in subject 1: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp1199rwoz.py", line 19, in <module>
    calculate_scores()
  File "/tmp/tmp1199rwoz.py", line 4, in calculate_scores
    score1 = float(input("Enter score in subject 1: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '80 70 90'
```
