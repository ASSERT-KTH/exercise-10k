## Exercise
Write a function that generates a new function that adds a given number to its input.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining a function that takes a number as an argument.
def generate_add_function(num):
    """
    This function generates a new function that adds a given number to its input.

    Args:
        num (int): The number to be added to the input of the generated function.

    Returns:
        function: A function that adds the given number to its input.
    """

    # Now, we define a nested function inside our main function. This nested function will have access to the variables of the outer function.
    def add_function(x):
        # The nested function simply adds the given number to its input and returns the result.
        return x + num

    # Finally, we return the nested function. This allows us to use the nested function outside the scope of the outer function.
    return add_function


# Example usage:
# We generate a function that adds 5 to its input.
add_five = generate_add_function(5)

# We use the generated function to add 5 to 10.
print(add_five(10))  # Outputs: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
