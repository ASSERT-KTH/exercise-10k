## Exercise
Write a program to find the element with the maximum frequency in a given array.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def max_frequency_element(arr):
    """
    Find the element with the maximum frequency in the given array.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array.

    Returns:
        The element with the maximum frequency.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq_count = Counter(arr)

    # Find the element with the maximum frequency
    max_freq_element = max(freq_count, key=freq_count.get)

    return max_freq_element

def main():
    # Example usage
    arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    max_freq_element = max_frequency_element(arr)
    print("Element with maximum frequency:", max_freq_element)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Element with maximum frequency: 4
```
