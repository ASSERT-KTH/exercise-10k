## Exercise
Understand how variable scope is resolved

## Reference Solution
```python
x = 10  # global scope

def foo():
    x = 20  # local scope
    print(x)  # prints 20

foo()
print(x)  # prints 10
```

```python
if True:
    x = 10  # block scope
    print(x)  # prints 10

# x is not accessible here
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("x is not defined")
```

```python
def foo():
    x = 10  # function scope
    def bar():
        print(x)  # prints 10
    bar()

foo()
# x is not accessible here
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("x is not defined")
```

```python
x = 10  # global scope

def foo():
    x = 20  # local scope
    def bar():
        print(x)  # prints 20
    bar()

foo()
print(x)  # prints 10
```
