## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Return the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Get and validate the user's choice."""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            return user_choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
