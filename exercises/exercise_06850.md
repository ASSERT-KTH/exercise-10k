## Exercise
Create a function called calculateGradePoint that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns their corresponding grade point. The grade points are as follows: score 90-100 corresponds to 4.0, score 80-89 corresponds to 3.0, score 70-79 corresponds to 2.0, score 60-69 corresponds to 1.0, and score below 60 corresponds to 0.0.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculateGradePoint(score: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the grade point based on the student's score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        float: The corresponding grade point.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the score is not between 0 and 100.
    """
    if not 0 <= score <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Score must be between 0 and 100")

    if 90 <= score <= 100:
        return 4.0
    elif 80 <= score <= 89:
        return 3.0
    elif 70 <= score <= 79:
        return 2.0
    elif 60 <= score <= 69:
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 0.0


# Example usage
def main():
    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]
    for score in scores:
        grade_point = calculateGradePoint(score)
        print(f"Score: {score}, Grade Point: {grade_point}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Score: 95, Grade Point: 4.0
Score: 85, Grade Point: 3.0
Score: 75, Grade Point: 2.0
Score: 65, Grade Point: 1.0
Score: 55, Grade Point: 0.0
```
