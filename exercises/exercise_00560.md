## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    seen = set()
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
result = length_of_longest_substring(s)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
3
```
