## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input, and returns two new lists containing the elements of the input list, unzipped into separate lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def unzip_tuples(tuples_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of tuples as input, and returns two new lists containing 
    the elements of the input list, unzipped into separate lists.

    Args:
        tuples_list (list): A list of tuples.

    Returns:
        tuple: Two lists containing the first and second elements of the input tuples.
    """

    # Initialize two empty lists to store the unzipped elements
    list1 = []
    
    # Initialize another empty list to store the second elements
    list2 = []

    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Append the first element of the tuple to the first list
        list1.append(tup[0])
        
        # Append the second element of the tuple to the second list
        list2.append(tup[1])

    # Return the two lists
    return list1, list2

# Alternatively, you can use the built-in zip function in combination with the * operator
# to unzip the list of tuples in a more concise way
def unzip_tuples_concise(tuples_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of tuples as input, and returns two new lists containing

    Returns:
        tuple: Two lists containing the first and second elements of the input tuples.
    """

    # Use the * operator to unpack the list of tuples into separate arguments for the zip function
    # The zip function then groups the corresponding elements from each tuple together
    # The * operator is used again to unpack the result of the zip function into separate lists
    # The result is then returned as a tuple of two lists
    return list(zip(*tuples_list)[0]), list(zip(*tuples_list)[1])
