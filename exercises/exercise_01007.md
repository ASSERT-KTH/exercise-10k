## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among all the strings.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if not strs:
            return ""
        
        short_str = min(strs, key=len)
        for i, ch in enumerate(short_str):
            for other in strs:
                if other[i] != ch:
                    return short_str[:i]
        return short_str

# Example usage:
print(Solution().longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"]))  # Output: "fl"
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
