## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays of integers as input and returns a new array containing the element-wise sum of the two input arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        result.append(arr1[i] + arr2[i])
    return result

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_arrays(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
```

## Generated Output
```
[7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
```
