## Exercise
Write a program that takes a character as input from the user and prints out its ASCII value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_ascii_value():
    """
    This function takes a character as input from the user and prints out its ASCII value.
    """
    char = input("Enter a character: ")
    
    # Check if the user has entered a single character
    if len(char) != 1:
        print("Please enter a single character.")
    else:
        # Get the ASCII value of the character
        ascii_value = ord(char)
        
        # Print the ASCII value
        print(f"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ascii_value}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_ascii_value()
```

## Generated Output
