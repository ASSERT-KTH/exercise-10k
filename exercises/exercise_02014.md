## Exercise
Create a program that takes the temperature and humidity as input and returns the corresponding weather forecast using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):
    """
    Returns the weather forecast based on the given temperature and humidity.

    Parameters:
    temperature (float): The current temperature in degree Celsius.
    humidity (float): The current humidity in percentage.

    Returns:
    str: The weather forecast.
    """

    # Check for extreme temperatures
    if temperature < 0:
        return "It's freezing! Wear warm clothes."
    elif temperature > 40:
        return "It's scorching hot! Stay hydrated and wear light clothes."

    # Check for different types of weather
    if temperature >= 25 and humidity < 60:
        return "It's a sunny day! Perfect for outdoor activities."
    elif temperature >= 15 and temperature < 25 and humidity < 80:
        return "It's a pleasant day! Ideal for a walk or a picnic."
    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 80:
        return "It's a cool day! Wear a light jacket and enjoy the outdoors."
    elif humidity >= 80:
        return "It's a humid day! Be prepared for rain or thunderstorms."

    # If none of the above conditions are met, return a default message
    return "The weather is normal. No special precautions needed."


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in degree Celsius: "))
    humidity = float(input("Enter the humidity in percentage: "))

    forecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)
    print(forecast)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the temperature in degree Celsius: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpn8r8m_gr.py", line 35, in <module>
    temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in degree Celsius: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '25 60'
```
