## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the tax owed given the income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate tax on.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.

    Returns:
        float: The tax owed.
    """
    tax_owed = income * tax_rate
    return tax_owed

def main():
    # Get user input
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 25 for 25%): "))

    # Convert tax rate to decimal
    tax_rate /= 100

    # Calculate tax owed
    tax_owed = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)

    # Print result
    print(f"Tax owed: ${tax_owed:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```

  File "/tmp/tmpu3mgz0dm.py", line 17, in main
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
