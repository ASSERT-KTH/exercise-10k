## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the total cost of a purchase given the price and quantity of items.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(price, quantity):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of a purchase.

    Args:
        price (float): The price of a single item.
        quantity (int): The number of items.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost of the purchase.
    """
    total_cost = price * quantity
    return total_cost

def main():
    # Get the price and quantity from the user
    price = float(input("Enter the price of an item: $"))
    quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity of items: "))

    # Calculate and display the total cost
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, quantity)
    print(f"The total cost is: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
