## Exercise
Count the number of students for each age in a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_students_by_age(students):
    """
    Counts the number of students for each age in a dictionary.

    Args:
        students (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are ages and values are the number of students for each age.
    """
    age_count = {}
    for age in students.values():
        if age in age_count:
            age_count[age] += 1
        else:
            age_count[age] = 1
    return age_count

# Example usage:
students = {
    "John": 20,
    "Alice": 21,
    "Bob": 20,
    "Charlie": 22,
    "David": 21
}

age_count = count_students_by_age(students)
print(age_count)
```

```python
{20: 2, 21: 2, 22: 1}
```

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_students_by_age(students):
    return dict(Counter(students.values()))

# Example usage:
students = {
    "John": 20,
    "Alice": 21,
    "Bob": 20,
    "Charlie": 22,
    "David": 21
}

age_count = count_students_by_age(students)
print(age_count)
```

## Generated Output
```
{20: 2, 21: 2, 22: 1}
```
