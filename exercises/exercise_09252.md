## Exercise
Write a program that uses nested loops to iterate over a sequence and perform tasks.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_grid(grid):
    """
    Print the grid using nested loops.
    """
    for i in range(len(grid)):  # outer loop
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):  # inner loop
            print(grid[i][j], end=" ")  # print each number
        print()  # new line after each row

def main():
    # Create a 3x3 grid
    grid = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    print("Grid:")
    print_grid(grid)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Grid:
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9
```
