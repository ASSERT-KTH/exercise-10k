## Exercise
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following operations: calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the first two numbers, and then calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the result and the third number. The program should output the results of all these operations in a clear and readable format.

## Reference Solution
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

sum1 = a + b
sub1 = a - b
mul1 = a * b
div1 = a / b

sum2 = sum1 + c
sub2 = sum1 - c
mul2 = sum1 * c
div2 = sum1 / c

print(f"Sum of first two numbers: {sum1}")
print(f"Difference of first two numbers: {sub1}")
print(f"Product of first two numbers: {mul1}")
print(f"Quotient of first two numbers: {div1}")

print(f"Sum of first two numbers and the third number: {sum2}")
print(f"Difference of first two numbers and the third number: {sub2}")
print(f"Product of first two numbers and the third number: {mul2}")
print(f"Quotient of first two numbers and the third number: {div2}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpxqnonabm.py", line 1, in <module>
    a = int(input())
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 5 2'
