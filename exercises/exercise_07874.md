## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a word is in a dictionary using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary
dictionary = {
    "apple": "A type of fruit",
    "car": "A type of vehicle",
    "house": "A type of building",
    "tree": "A type of plant"
}

def check_word(word):
    # Convert the word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    word = word.lower()

    # Check if the word is in the dictionary
    if word in dictionary:
        print(f"The word '{word}' is in the dictionary.")
        print(f"Meaning: {dictionary[word]}")
    else:
        print(f"The word '{word}' is not in the dictionary.")

# Test the function
check_word("apple")
check_word("house")
check_word("dog")
```

## Generated Output
```
The word 'apple' is in the dictionary.
Meaning: A type of fruit
The word 'house' is in the dictionary.
