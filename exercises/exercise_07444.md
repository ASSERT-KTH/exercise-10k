## Exercise
Write a function that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The function should take an array as input and return the maximum value. If the array is empty, the function should return null.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_value(array):
    """
    This function finds the maximum value in an array of integers.
    
    Args:
        array (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The maximum value in the array, or None if the array is empty.
    """
    
    # First, we check if the array is empty. If it is, we return None.
    if not array:
        return None
    
    # We initialize the max_value variable with the first element of the array.
    # This is because we have to start the comparison from somewhere, and the first element is as good as any.
    max_value = array[0]
    
    # Now, we iterate over the rest of the array.
    for num in array[1:]:
        # For each number in the array, we check if it's greater than the current max_value.
        if num > max_value:
            # If it is, we update max_value to be this new number.
            max_value = num
    
    # Finally, after checking all numbers in the array, we return the max_value.
    return max_value
```
