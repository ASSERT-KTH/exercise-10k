## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_ceiling(num):
    """
    Calculate the ceiling of a number.

    Args:
        num (float): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The ceiling of the input number.
    """
    return math.ceil(num)

def main():
    # Get user input
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Calculate and print the ceiling
    ceiling = calculate_ceiling(num)
    print("The ceiling of {} is {}".format(num, ceiling))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
