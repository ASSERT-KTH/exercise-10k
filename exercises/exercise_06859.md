## Exercise
Write a function that analyzes a dictionary containing employee data. The dictionary should have employee IDs as keys and another dictionary as values. The inner dictionary should contain the employee's name, age, and salary. The function should calculate the average salary of all employees and return it. If the dictionary is empty, the function should return 0.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_salary(employee_data):
    """
    This function calculates the average salary of all employees in the given dictionary.

    Args:
        employee_data (dict): A dictionary containing employee data. The dictionary should have employee IDs as keys and another dictionary as values.
                              The inner dictionary should contain the employee's name, age, and salary.

    Returns:
        float: The average salary of all employees. If the dictionary is empty, the function returns 0.
    """

    # First, we check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we return 0 as per the problem statement.
    if not employee_data:
        return 0

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of all salaries. We start with 0 because we haven't added any salaries yet.
    total_salary = 0

    # Initialize a variable to store the count of employees. We start with 0 because we haven't counted any employees yet.
    employee_count = 0

    # Iterate over each employee in the dictionary.
    for employee in employee_data.values():
        # For each employee, add their salary to the total salary.
        total_salary += employee['salary']
        
        # Increment the employee count by 1.
        employee_count += 1

    # Calculate the average salary by dividing the total salary by the employee count.
    average_salary = total_salary / employee_count

    # Return the calculated average salary.
    return average_salary
```
