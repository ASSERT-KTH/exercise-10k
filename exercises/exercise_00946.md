## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize variables
i = 1
sum_of_squares = 0

# Loop through numbers from 1 to 10
while i <= 10:
    # Calculate the square of the current number and add it to the sum
    sum_of_squares += i ** 2
    # Move to the next number
    i += 1

# Print the result
print("The sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 is:", sum_of_squares)
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 385
```
