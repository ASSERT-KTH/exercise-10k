## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the maximum sum of a subarray within a given one-dimensional array of integers. The function should take an array of integers as input and return the maximum sum of a subarray. If the array is empty, the function should return 0.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_subarray_sum(array):
    """
    This function calculates the maximum sum of a subarray within a given one-dimensional array of integers.
    
    Args:
        array (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The maximum sum of a subarray. If the array is empty, it returns 0.
    """

    # Check if the array is empty. If it is, return 0 as per the problem statement.
    if not array:
        return 0

    # Initialize the maximum current sum and the maximum global sum to the first element of the array.
    # This is because the maximum sum of a subarray must be at least the maximum single element in the array.
    max_current = max_global = array[0]

    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1).
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        # For each element, calculate the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous maximum current sum.
        # This is because the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current position is either the current element itself or the sum of the current element and the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the previous position.
        max_current = max(array[i], max_current + array[i])
        
        # Update the maximum global sum if the maximum current sum is greater than the maximum global sum.
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current

    # Return the maximum global sum, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in the entire array.
    return max_global
```
