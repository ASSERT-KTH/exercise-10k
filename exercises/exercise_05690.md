## Exercise
Write a program that takes the time as input and checks if it's morning, afternoon, or evening using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
// Comment: The program will take an input in the form of hours and minutes and determine whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int hours, minutes;
    cin >> hours >> minutes;

    if (hours >= 6 && hours < 12) {
        cout << "morning" << endl;
    } else if (hours < 18) {
        cout << "afternoon" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "evening" << endl;
    }
