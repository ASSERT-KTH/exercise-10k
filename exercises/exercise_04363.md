## Exercise
Write a program that retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_value_from_dict(dictionary, key):
    """
    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key (any): The key to search for.

    Returns:
        any: The value associated with the key if it exists, None otherwise.
    """
    return dictionary.get(key)

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
key_to_search = 'age'

value = get_value_from_dict(my_dict, key_to_search)

if value is not None:
    print(f"The value associated with the key '{key_to_search}' is: {value}")
else:
    print(f"The key '{key_to_search}' does not exist in the dictionary.")
```

## Generated Output
