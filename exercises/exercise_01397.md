## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to generate a random password of length 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    """
    Generate a random password of the given length.
    """
    # Define the characters that can be used in the password
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    
    # Initialize an empty password
    password = ""
    
    # Use a for loop to generate the password
    for _ in range(length):
        # Randomly select a character from the possible characters
        password += random.choice(characters)
    
    return password

def main():
    # Define the length of the password
    password_length = 10
    
    # Generate and print the password
    password = generate_password(password_length)
    print(f"Generated Password: {password}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
