## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of their squares.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.
    """

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares. We start with 0 because 
    # we haven't added any squares yet.
    sum_squares = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the input list.
    for num in numbers:
        # For each number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.
        # We use the ** operator to calculate the square of a number.
        sum_squares += num ** 2

    # After iterating over all numbers, return the sum of their squares.
    return sum_squares

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_squares(numbers))  # Output: 55
```

## Generated Output
```
55
```
