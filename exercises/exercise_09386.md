## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    average = total / count

    return average

def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of {numbers} is: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
