## Exercise
Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The program should prompt the user for a student's name and their grades in three subjects: math, science, and English. The grades should be stored in a dictionary where the keys are the student's name and the values are another dictionary with the subject as the key and the grade as the value. The program should then print out the student's grades in a formatted manner.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Create an empty dictionary to store student grades
student_grades = {}

# Prompt the user for the student's name
s_name = input("Enter student name: ")

# Create a dictionary for the student's grades
student_grades[s_name] = {}

# Prompt the user for the student's grades in math, science, and English
math_grade = input("Enter math grade: ")
science_grade = input("Enter science grade: ")
english_grade = input("Enter English grade: ")

# Store the grades in the student's dictionary
student_grades[s_name] = {"math": math_grade, "science": science_grade, "english": english_grade}

# Print the student's grades in a formatted manner
print(f"Student Name: {s_name}")
print(f"Math Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['math']}")
print(f"Science Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['science']}")
print(f"English Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['english']}")

# Note: This program does not store grades for multiple students. To do so, you would need to create a loop that prompts the user for multiple students' names and grades, and stores each student's grades in the dictionary with their name as the key.
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter student name: Enter math grade: Enter science grade: Enter English grade: Student Name: John
Math Grade: 90
Science Grade: 85
English Grade: 95
```
