## Exercise
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def length_of_lis(nums):
    """
    Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array of integers.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Initialize the dp array with 1s, since a single element is always an increasing subsequence
    dp = [1] * len(nums)

    # Iterate over the array and update the dp array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous element, update the dp array
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Return the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    return max(dp)


# Example usage:
nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
print("Length of LIS:", length_of_lis(nums))
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of LIS: 6
```
