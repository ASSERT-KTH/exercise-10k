## Exercise
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCDE' and 'ABFCD' is 'ABC'. Your task is to write a function to compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):
    """
    Compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences.

    Args:
    seq1 (str): The first sequence.
    seq2 (str): The second sequence.

    Returns:
    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.
    """

    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
    dp = [[0] * (len(seq2) + 1) for _ in range(len(seq1) + 1)]

    # Iterate over the characters in both sequences
    for i in range(1, len(seq1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(seq2) + 1):
            # If the current characters match, increase the length of the common subsequence
            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            # Otherwise, take the maximum length from the previous characters
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the array
    return dp[-1][-1]


# Example usage
seq1 = "ABCDE"
seq2 = "ABFCD"
print("Length of longest common subsequence:", longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2))
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of longest common subsequence: 4
```
