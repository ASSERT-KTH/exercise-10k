## Exercise
Write a function to retrieve the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def retrieve_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key (any): The key to search for.

    Returns:
        any: The value associated with the key if found, None otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("The input is not a dictionary.")

    # Then, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    # We use the 'in' keyword to check for key existence
    if key in dictionary:
        # If the key exists, we return its associated value
        # We use the 'get' method to retrieve the value
        # This method returns None if the key does not exist, but we've already checked for that
        return dictionary.get(key)
    else:
        # If the key does not exist, we return None
        # This could be changed to raise an exception or handle the situation in some other way
        return None

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(retrieve_value(my_dict, "name"))  # Outputs: John
print(retrieve_value(my_dict, "age"))   # Outputs: 30
print(retrieve_value(my_dict, "city"))  # Outputs: None
```

## Generated Output
```
John
30
None
```
