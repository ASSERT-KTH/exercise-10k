## Exercise
Create a function that uses async/await to asynchronously compute the sum of a list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def async_sum(numbers):
    """Asynchronously compute the sum of a list of numbers"""
    
    # Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with 5 worker threads
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # Use asyncio.gather to run tasks concurrently
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        futures = [loop.run_in_executor(executor, sum, [numbers[i]]) for i in range(len(numbers))]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*futures)
        
        # Return the sum of the results
        return sum(results)

async def partial_sum(numbers, start, end):
    """Asynchronously compute the partial sum of a list of numbers"""
    
    # Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with 5 worker threads
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # Use asyncio.gather to run tasks concurrently
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        future = loop.run_in_executor(executor, sum, numbers[start:end])
        result = await future
        
        # Return the partial sum
        return result

async def async_sum_parallel(numbers, num_tasks):
    """Asynchronously compute the sum of a list of numbers in parallel"""
    
    # Calculate the chunk size for each task
    chunk_size = len(numbers) // num_tasks
    
    # Create tasks for each chunk
    tasks = []
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        start = i * chunk_size
        end = (i + 1) * chunk_size if i < num_tasks - 1 else len(numbers)
        tasks.append(partial_sum(numbers, start, end))
    
    # Run tasks concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Return the sum of the results
    return sum(results)

# Example usage
async def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    result = await async_sum_parallel(numbers, 5)
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
