## Exercise
Create a recursive function to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list. Use the function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].

## Reference Solution
```python
def recursive_sum(numbers):
    """
    Recursively calculates the sum of all numbers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers in the list.
    """
    # Base case: if the list is empty, return 0
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    # Recursive case: add the first number to the sum of the rest of the list
    else:
        return numbers[0] + recursive_sum(numbers[1:])

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = recursive_sum(numbers)
print(f"The sum of the numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the numbers in the list is: 10
```
