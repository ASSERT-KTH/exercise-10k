## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their name and the current time of day (in 24-hour format). Then, print out a greeting based on the time of day (e.g., Good morning, Good afternoon, Good evening)

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_greeting(hour):
    """
    Returns a greeting based on the time of day.

    Args:
        hour (int): The current hour in 24-hour format.

    Returns:
        str: The greeting.
    """
    if 0 <= hour < 12:
        return "Good morning"
    elif 12 <= hour < 17:
        return "Good afternoon"
    else:
        return "Good evening"

def main():
    # Ask the user for their name
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")

    # Ask the user for the current time of day
    while True:
        try:
            hour = int(input("Please enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): "))
            if 0 <= hour < 24:
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid hour. Please enter a number between 0 and 23.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Get the greeting based on the time of day
    greeting = get_greeting(hour)

    # Print out the greeting
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcdg3tswk.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcdg3tswk.py", line 25, in main
    hour = int(input("Please enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): "))
