## Exercise
Write a function that composes two higher-order functions together, creating a new function that applies each higher-order function in sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose(func1, func2):
    """
    Composes two higher-order functions together, creating a new function that applies each higher-order function in sequence.

    Args:
        func1 (function): The first higher-order function.
        func2 (function): The second higher-order function.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that applies func1 and then func2.
    """
    
    # We want to create a new function that takes an argument and applies func1 and then func2 to it
    def composed_function(arg):
        
        # First, we apply func1 to the argument
        intermediate_result = func1(arg)
        
        # Then, we apply func2 to the result of func1
        final_result = func2(intermediate_result)
        
        # Finally, we return the final result
        return final_result
    
    # We return the new composed function
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

# Compose the functions double and add_one
composed = compose(double, add_one)

# Apply the composed function to the number 5
result = composed(5)
print(result)  # Outputs: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
