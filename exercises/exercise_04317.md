## Exercise
Create a function that checks the type of a variable and returns an error message if it's not the expected type

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_type(var, expected_type):
    """
    Checks the type of a variable and returns an error message if it's not the expected type.

    Args:
        var (any): The variable to be checked.
        expected_type (type): The expected type of the variable.

    Returns:
        str or None: An error message if the variable is not of the expected type, otherwise None.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the type of the variable is the same as the expected type
    # We can use the isinstance() function in Python to check if an object is an instance of a class or its subclass
    if not isinstance(var, expected_type):
        
        # If the variable is not of the expected type, we return an error message
        # The error message should include the actual type of the variable and the expected type
        # We can use the type() function to get the type of the variable
        return f"Error: Expected {expected_type.__name__} but got {type(var).__name__}"
    
    # If the variable is of the expected type, we return None
    # This indicates that there is no error
    return None

# Example usage:
print(check_type(5, int))  # Should return None
print(check_type("hello", int))  # Should return an error message
```

## Generated Output
```
None
Error: Expected int but got str
```
