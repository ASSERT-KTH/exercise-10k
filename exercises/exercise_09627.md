## Exercise
Write a function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is less than 0.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)


def main():
    # Example usage:
    num = 5
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
