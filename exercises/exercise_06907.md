## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string input from the user, checks if it's a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), and then reverses the string. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print 'Palindrome' along with the reversed string. If not, it should print 'Not a palindrome' along with the reversed string.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initial comments
# If I want to add any functionality in the future, I can do so here
# This code is for reversing a string and checking if it's a palindrome

# Get user input
mystring = input("Enter a string: ")

# Reverse the string
mystring = mystring[::-1]

# Check if the string is a palindrome
if mystring == mystring[::-1]:
    print("Palindrome: ", mystring)
else:
    print("Not a palindrome: ", mystring)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Palindrome:  madam
```
