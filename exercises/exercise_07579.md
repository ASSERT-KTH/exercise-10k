## Exercise
Create a function that uses accessibility features such as screen reader support to provide support for users with disabilities.

## Reference Solution
```python
def accessibility_support(text, screen_reader=True):
    """
    This function uses accessibility features such as screen reader support to provide support for users with disabilities.
    
    Parameters:
    text (str): The text to be read by the screen reader.
    screen_reader (bool): A flag to enable or disable the screen reader. Default is True.
    
    Returns:
    str: The text that was read by the screen reader.
    """

    # First, we check if the screen reader is enabled
    if screen_reader:
        # If it's enabled, we use the pyttsx3 library to speak the text
        # This library is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python
        import pyttsx3
        
        # We initialize the engine
        engine = pyttsx3.init()
        
        # We set the speech rate to a moderate level
        # You can adjust this to your liking
        engine.setProperty('rate', 150)
        
        # We speak the text
        # This will activate the screen reader and read the text aloud
        engine.say(text)
        
        # We run the engine to start the speech
        engine.runAndWait()
        
        # Finally, we return the text that was read by the screen reader
        return text
    
    # If the screen reader is disabled, we simply return the text
    else:
        return text

# Test the function
print(accessibility_support("Hello, world!"))
```
