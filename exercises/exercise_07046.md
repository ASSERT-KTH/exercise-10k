## Exercise
Write a program that takes a distance in miles as input and prints out the equivalent distance in kilometers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def miles_to_kilometers(miles):
    """
    Converts miles to kilometers.

    Args:
        miles (float): Distance in miles.

    Returns:
        float: Distance in kilometers.
    """
    kilometers = miles * 1.60934
    return kilometers

def main():
    # Get user input
    miles = float(input("Enter distance in miles: "))

    # Convert miles to kilometers
    kilometers = miles_to_kilometers(miles)

    # Print result
    print(f"{miles} miles is equivalent to {kilometers:.2f} kilometers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter distance in miles: 5.0 miles is equivalent to 8.05 kilometers.
```
