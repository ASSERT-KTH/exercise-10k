## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their age and checks if it's a valid integer

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_age():
    """Get the user's age and validate if it's a positive integer."""
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if age <= 0:
                print("Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.")
            else:
                return age
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def main():
    """Main function."""
    age = get_age()
    print(f"Your age is: {age}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
