## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, give the user a hint, such as 'too high' or 'too low'.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of guesses
    num_guesses = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("What's your guess? (or 'q' to quit): ")
        
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == 'q':
            print("Okay, the number was {}.".format(number_to_guess))
            break
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
            print("Please guess a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of guesses
        num_guesses += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print("Congratulations! You found the number in {} guesses.".format(num_guesses))
            break
        # Give the user a hint if their guess is too high or too low
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        else:
            print("Too high!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
What's your guess? (or 'q' to quit): Too low!
What's your guess? (or 'q' to quit):
