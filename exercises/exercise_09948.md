## Exercise
Create a program that determines the grade of an ebook seller based on the number of ebooks sold. The grade is determined by the following conditions: if the seller sold less than 50 ebooks, they get an F grade; if they sold between 50 and 100 ebooks, they get a D grade; if they sold between 101 and 200 ebooks, they get a C grade; if they sold between 201 and 400 ebooks, they get a B grade; and if they sold more than 400 ebooks, they get an A grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_grade(sales):
    """
    Determine the grade of an ebook seller based on the number of ebooks sold.

    Args:
        sales (int): The number of ebooks sold.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the ebook seller.
    """

    if sales < 50:
        return "F"
    elif 50 <= sales <= 100:
        return "D"
    elif 101 <= sales <= 200:
        return "C"
    elif 201 <= sales <= 400:
        return "B"
    else:
        return "A"


def main():
    sales = int(input("Enter the number of ebooks sold: "))
    grade = determine_grade(sales)
    print(f"The grade of the ebook seller is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
