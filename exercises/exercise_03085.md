## Exercise
Create two functions, one that doubles a number and another that squares a number, then compose these functions to create a new function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def double_number(num):
    """
    Doubles the input number.
    
    Args:
        num (int or float): The number to double.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The doubled number.
    """
    return num * 2

def square_number(num):
    """
    Squares the input number.
    
    Args:
        num (int or float): The number to square.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The squared number.
    """
    return num ** 2

def double_and_square(num):
    """
    Doubles and then squares the input number.
    
    Args:
        num (int or float): The number to double and square.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The result of doubling and squaring the number.
    """
    return square_number(double_number(num))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    result = double_and_square(num)
    print(f"The result of doubling and squaring {num} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The result of doubling and squaring 5 is: 100
```
