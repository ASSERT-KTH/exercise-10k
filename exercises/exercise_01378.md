## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import statistics

def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode.
    """
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    median = statistics.median(numbers)
    mode = statistics.mode(numbers)
    
    return {
        "mean": mean,
        "median": median,
        "mode": mode
    }

def main():
    numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
    stats = calculate_statistics(numbers)
    
    print("Statistics:")
    print(f"Mean: {stats['mean']}")
    print(f"Median: {stats['median']}")
    print(f"Mode: {stats['mode']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: Statistics:
Mean: 3
Median: 3
Mode: 1
```
