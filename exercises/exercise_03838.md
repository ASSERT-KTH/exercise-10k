## Exercise
Write a program that takes a word as input, scrambles it, and asks the user to unscramble it.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def scramble_word(word):
    """Scramble a given word."""
    word_list = list(word)
    random.shuffle(word_list)
    return ''.join(word_list)

def main():
    """Main function."""
    word = input("Enter a word: ")
    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)
    print(f"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}")

    answer = input("Your answer: ")
    if answer.lower() == word.lower():
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a word: Unscramble the word: inltes
Your answer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpw97mpiog.py", line 22, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpw97mpiog.py", line 15, in main
    answer = input("Your answer: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
