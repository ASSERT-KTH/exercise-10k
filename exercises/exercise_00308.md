## Exercise
Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_element(lst, target):
    """

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to search in.
        target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.
    """
    return lst.count(target)

# Example usage:
def main():
    my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    target_element = 3
    count = count_element(my_list, target_element)
    print(f"The element {target_element} occurs {count} times in the list.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
