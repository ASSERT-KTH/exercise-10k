## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of its other two sides.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the code

import math

def hypotenuse(a, b):
    # This is a comment explaining the purpose of the function
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Test the function
print(hypotenuse(3, 4))  # Output: 5.0
```

## Generated Output
```
5.0
```
