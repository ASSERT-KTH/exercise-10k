## Exercise
Write a program that takes a compressed string as input and returns the original string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def decompress_string(compressed_str):
    """
    Decompresses a compressed string.

    The compressed string is in the format 'a1b2c3', which represents 'abbccc'.
    The number following each character represents how many times the character should be repeated.

    Args:
        compressed_str (str): The compressed string.

    Returns:
        str: The decompressed string.
    """
    decompressed_str = ""
    i = 0

    while i < len(compressed_str):
        char = compressed_str[i]
        count = ""

        # Get the count of the character
        i += 1
        while i < len(compressed_str) and compressed_str[i].isdigit():
            count += compressed_str[i]
            i += 1

        # If no count is specified, assume it is 1
        if count == "":
            count = "1"

        # Add the character to the decompressed string 'count' times
        decompressed_str += char * int(count)

    return decompressed_str


# Test the function
compressed_str = "a1b2c3"
print(decompress_string(compressed_str))  # Outputs: abbccc
```

## Generated Output
```
abbccc
```
