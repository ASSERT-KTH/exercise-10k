## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the percentage increase between two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_percentage_increase(original_value, new_value):
    """
    Calculate the percentage increase between two numbers.

    Args:
        original_value (float): The original value.
        new_value (float): The new value.

    Returns:
        float: The percentage increase.
    """
    if original_value == 0:
        raise ValueError("Original value cannot be zero")

    percentage_increase = ((new_value - original_value) / original_value) * 100
    return percentage_increase

def main():
    # Example usage
    original_value = 100
    new_value = 120
    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(original_value, new_value)
    print(f"The percentage increase from {original_value} to {new_value} is {percentage_increase:.2f}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The percentage increase from 100 to 120 is 20.00%
```
