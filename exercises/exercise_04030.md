## Exercise
Implement a function to find the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one

## Reference Solution
```python
def single_number(nums):
    """
    Finds the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The single number that appears only once.
    """
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        # XOR operation: a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a
        result ^= num
    return result

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [2, 2, 1]
    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 1

    nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
```
