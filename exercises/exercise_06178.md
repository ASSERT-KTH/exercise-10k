## Exercise
Write a function that takes a number as input and returns True if it is prime, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number is prime.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:  # Prime numbers are greater than 1
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):  # Check divisibility up to the square root of n
        if n % i == 0:  # If n is divisible by any number, it's not prime
            return False
    return True  # If n is not divisible by any number, it's prime

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"Is {num} prime? {is_prime(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 2 prime? True
Is 3 prime? True
Is 4 prime? False
Is 5 prime? True
Is 6 prime? False
Is 7 prime? True
Is 8 prime? False
Is 9 prime? False
Is 10 prime? False
```
