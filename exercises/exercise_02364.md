## Exercise
Design a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")

    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor

    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    """
    Get two numbers from the user, calculate their quotient and remainder, and print the results.
    """
    try:
        dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
        divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)

        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}")

    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.
```
