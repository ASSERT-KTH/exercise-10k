## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and a reduction function as input, and returns the result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduction_function(x, y):
    return x + y

def reduce(array, function):
    result = None
    for element in array:
        if result is None:
            result = element
        else:
            result = function(result, element)
    return result

def main():
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = reduce(array, reduction_function)
    print(result)

main()
```
