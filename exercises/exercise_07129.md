## Exercise
Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks followed by a sequence of spaces. The number of asterisks in each row should increase by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces should decrease by 1, starting from the user-inputted number. Use loops (for/while) to generate the pattern.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;
    cin >> num;

    int i = 1;
    while (i <= num) {
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= i) {
            cout << "*";
            j++;
        }

        int k = 1;
        while (k <= num - i) {
            cout << " ";
            k++;
        }

        cout << endl;
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
