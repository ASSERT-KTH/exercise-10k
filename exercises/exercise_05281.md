## Exercise
Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user, where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program should use a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess the correct number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None
    tries = 0

    while guess != number_to_guess:
        guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
        if not guess.isdigit():
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
            continue
        guess = int(guess)
        tries += 1

        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")

    print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {tries} tries.")

guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
