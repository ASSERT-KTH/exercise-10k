## Exercise
Given a string, compress it by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count of the number of times it appears.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compress_string(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Compress a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count of the number of times it appears.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: The compressed string.
    """
    if not s:
        return ""

    compressed = []
    count = 1

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            compressed.append(s[i - 1] + str(count))
            count = 1

    compressed.append(s[-1] + str(count))
    return "".join(compressed)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "AAABBBCCCDDDD"
    compressed = compress_string(s)
    print(f"Original string: {s}")
    print(f"Compressed string: {compressed}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Original string: AAABBBCCCDDDD
Compressed string: A3B3C3D4
```
