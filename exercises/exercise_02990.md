## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of the given list of numbers.
    """
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
    print(f"The sum of squares of {numbers} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of squares of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is: 55
