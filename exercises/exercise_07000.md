## Exercise
Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its volume.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_sphere_volume(radius):
    """
    This function calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.
    
    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the sphere.
    
    Returns:
    float: The volume of the sphere.
    """
    
    # First, we need to check if the input is a non-negative number, 
    # because the radius cannot be negative.
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("The radius cannot be negative.")
    
    # The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * π * r^3, 
    # where r is the radius of the sphere.
    # We use the math.pi constant from the math module for π.
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    
    # Finally, we return the calculated volume.
    return volume

# Test the function with a radius of 5.
print(calculate_sphere_volume(5))
