## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the most frequent value.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def most_frequent_value(numbers):
    """
    Returns the most frequent value(s) in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the most frequent value(s).
    """
    # Count the frequency of each number
    frequency = Counter(numbers)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())

    # Return all numbers with the maximum frequency
    return [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
print(most_frequent_value(numbers))  # Output: [4]
```

## Generated Output
```
