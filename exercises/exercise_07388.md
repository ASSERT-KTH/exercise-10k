## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for their name and age, then validates the input to ensure the name is not empty and the age is a positive integer. If the input is valid, print out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the input is invalid, print an error message and ask for the input again.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    while not name:
        print("Error: Name cannot be empty.")
        name = input("What is your name? ")

    age = input("How old are you? ")
    while not age.isdigit():
        print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
        age = input("How old are you? ")

    return name, int(age)

def main():
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
What is your name? How old are you? 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd1j9d1d9.py", line 19, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpd1j9d1d9.py", line 15, in main
    name, age = get_user_info()
  File "/tmp/tmpd1j9d1d9.py", line 7, in get_user_info
    age = input("How old are you? ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
