## Exercise
Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and outputs the compound interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money
        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal)
        time (int): The time the money is invested for (in years)

    Returns:
        float: The compound interest
    """
    compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** time - principal
    return compound_interest


def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = int(input("Enter the time (in years): "))

    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)

    print(f"The compound interest is: {compound_interest:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5s33j183.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp5s33j183.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
