## Exercise
Write a function called 'count_vowels' that counts and returns the number of vowels in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_vowels(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels present in it.

    Parameters:
    input_string (str): The string to be checked for vowels.

    Returns:
    int: The number of vowels in the input string.
    """

    # Initialize a counter variable to store the count of vowels
    vowel_count = 0
    
    # Define all the vowels in a string
    # We are considering both lowercase and uppercase vowels
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in vowels:
            # If the character is a vowel, increment the vowel count
            vowel_count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of vowels
    return vowel_count

# Test the function
print(count_vowels("Hello World"))
