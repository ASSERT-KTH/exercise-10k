## Exercise
Write a function to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start_node):
    """
    Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

    Args:
    - graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is another dictionary.
                    The inner dictionary's keys are the node's neighbors and its values are the edge weights.
    - start_node (str): The node to start the search from.

    Returns:
    - distances (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the shortest distances from the start node.
    - shortest_paths (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the shortest paths from the start node.

    # Initialize distances and previous nodes
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    shortest_paths = {node: [] for node in graph}
    shortest_paths[start_node] = [start_node]

    # Priority queue to store nodes to be processed
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]

    while priority_queue:
        # Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

    distances, shortest_paths = dijkstra(graph, start_node)

    print("Shortest Distances:")
    for node, distance in distances.items():

    print("\nShortest Paths:")
    for node, path in shortest_paths.items():

    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Shortest Distances:
A -> A: 0
A -> B: 1
A -> C: 3
A -> D: 4

Shortest Paths:
A -> A: ['A']
A -> B: ['A', 'B']
A -> C: ['A', 'B', 'C']
A -> D: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
