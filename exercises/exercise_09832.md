## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. The program should use a basic algorithm to find the maximum number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def maxNumber(list):
    maxNum = list[0]
    for i in list:
        if i > maxNum:
            maxNum = i
    return maxNum

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(maxNumber(list))
```

## Generated Output
```
50
```
