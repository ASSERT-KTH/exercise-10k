## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, then multiplies the result by 3 and finally subtracts 10 from it. Use variables to store the intermediate results and print the final result.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Calculate intermediate results
res_1 = a + b
res_2 = res_1 * 3
res_3 = res_2 - 10

# Print final result
print(res_3)
```

## Generated Output
```
35
```
