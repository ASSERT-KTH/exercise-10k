## Exercise
Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The program should take a list of integers as input and output the sorted list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def insertionSort(A):
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        key = A[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < A[j]:
            A[j + 1] = A[j]
            j -= 1
        A[j + 1] = key
    return A

# Example usage
A = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]
sorted_A = insertionSort(A)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_A)

# Expected output
# Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
