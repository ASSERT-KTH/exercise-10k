## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains only lowercase characters, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_lowercase(s):
    """
    This function checks if a given string contains only lowercase characters.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string contains only lowercase characters, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string.")

    # We use the built-in islower() method in Python, which returns True if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, otherwise False.
    # This method does not consider non-cased characters like spaces or punctuation, so it fits our needs perfectly.
    return s.islower()
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
