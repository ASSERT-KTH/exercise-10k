## Exercise
Create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors using conditional statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    while True:
        # Get player 1's choice
        player1_choice = input("Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while player1_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            player1_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        # Get player 2's choice
        player2_choice = input("Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while player2_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            player2_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        # Determine the winner
        if player1_choice == player2_choice:
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif (player1_choice == "rock" and player2_choice == "scissors") or \
             (player1_choice == "scissors" and player2_choice == "paper") or \
             (player1_choice == "paper" and player2_choice == "rock"):
            print("Player 1 wins!")
        else:
            print("Player 2 wins!")

        # Ask if players want to play again
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors:
