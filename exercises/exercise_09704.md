## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to identify the maximum value correctly even if it appears multiple times in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_val(lst):
    max_val = lst[0]
    for i in lst:
        if i > max_val:
            max_val = i
    return max_val

def main():
    lst = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()]
    print("Maximum value in the list:", max_val(lst))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkoi1hq4v.py", line 13, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkoi1hq4v.py", line 9, in main
    lst = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()]
  File "/tmp/tmpkoi1hq4v.py", line 9, in <listcomp>
    lst = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()]
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[4,'
```
