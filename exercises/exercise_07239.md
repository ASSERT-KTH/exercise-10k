## Exercise
Write a Python program that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are dictionaries with keys 'math' and 'science' representing their grades in these subjects. Calculate the average grade for each subject across all students and print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(students):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each subject across all students.

    Args:
        students (dict): Dictionary with student names as keys and dictionaries with 'math' and 'science' grades as values.

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary with subject names as keys and average grades as values.
    """
    # Initialize variables to store sum of grades and count of students for each subject
    math_sum = 0
    science_sum = 0
    student_count = len(students)

    # Iterate over each student's grades
    for student_grades in students.values():
        math_sum += student_grades['math']
        science_sum += student_grades['science']

    # Calculate average grades for each subject
    average_math_grade = math_sum / student_count
    average_science_grade = science_sum / student_count

    # Return a dictionary with average grades for each subject
    return {
        'math': average_math_grade,
        'science': average_science_grade
    }

def main():
    # Example dictionary with student grades
    students = {
        'John': {'math': 85, 'science': 90},
        'Alice': {'math': 92, 'science': 88},
        'Bob': {'math': 78, 'science': 95},
        'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 92},
        'David': {'math': 88, 'science': 85}
    }

    # Calculate average grades
    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(students)

    # Print the results
    print("Average Grades:")
    for subject, average_grade in average_grades.items():
        print(f"{subject.capitalize()}: {average_grade:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Average Grades:
Math: 87.60
Science: 90.00
```
