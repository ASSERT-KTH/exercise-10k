## Exercise
Declare a variable inside and outside a function, then try to access the variables from different scopes.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a variable outside a function (global scope)
global_variable = "I'm global"

def my_function():
    # Declare a variable inside a function (local scope)
    local_variable = "I'm local"
    
    # Try to access the global variable from inside the function
    print("Inside function: global_variable =", global_variable)
    
    # Try to access the local variable from inside the function
    print("Inside function: local_variable =", local_variable)

# Try to access the global variable from outside the function
print("Outside function: global_variable =", global_variable)

# Try to access the local variable from outside the function
try:
    print("Outside function: local_variable =", local_variable)
except NameError:
    print("Outside function: local_variable is not defined")

my_function()
```

## Generated Output
```
Outside function: global_variable = I'm global
Outside function: local_variable is not defined
Inside function: global_variable = I'm global
Inside function: local_variable = I'm local
```
