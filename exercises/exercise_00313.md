## Exercise
Write a function that flattens a given list of lists into a single list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the nested lists.

    Args:
        nested_list (list): A list containing other lists as elements.

    Returns:
        list: A single list containing all elements from the nested lists.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the flattened elements
    flattened = []

    # Iterate over each element in the nested list
    for element in nested_list:
        
        # Check if the current element is a list itself
        if isinstance(element, list):
            
            # If it's a list, extend the flattened list with its elements
            # This way, we can handle nested lists of arbitrary depth
            flattened.extend(flatten_list(element))
        
        else:
            
            # If it's not a list, simply append the element to the flattened list
            flattened.append(element)

    # Return the flattened list
    return flattened

# Example usage:
nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, [6, 7]]]
print(flatten_list(nested_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
