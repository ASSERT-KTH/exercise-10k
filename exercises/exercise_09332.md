## Exercise
Write a program to perform logical operations using variables, such as AND, OR, and NOT.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define two boolean variables
a = True
b = False

# AND operation
print("AND operation:")
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("a and b =", a and b)

# OR operation
print("\nOR operation:")
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("a or b =", a or b)

# NOT operation
print("\nNOT operation:")
print("a =", a)
print("not a =", not a)
print("b =", b)
print("not b =", not b)
```

## Generated Output
```
AND operation:
a = True
b = False
a and b = False

OR operation:
a = True
b = False
a or b = True

NOT operation:
a = True
not a = False
b = False
not b = True
```
