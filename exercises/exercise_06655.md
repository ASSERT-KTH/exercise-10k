## Exercise
Write a program to find the result of the modulus operation on two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def modulus_operation(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the result of the modulus operation on two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        int: The remainder of the division.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return dividend % divisor

def main():
    # Example usage
    dividend = 17
    divisor = 5
    result = modulus_operation(dividend, divisor)
    print(f"The result of {dividend} % {divisor} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The result of 17 % 5 is: 2
```
