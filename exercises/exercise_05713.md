## Exercise
Create a Mad Libs game that asks the user for words and generates a story with the given words.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input for a specific type of word
def get_word(prompt):
    """Get a word from the user."""
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:
            return word
        print("Please enter a word.")

# Define the Mad Libs game
def mad_libs_game():
    """Play the Mad Libs game."""
    print("Welcome to the Mad Libs game!")
    print("I will ask you for some words, and then I will create a story with them.")

    # Get the words from the user
    name = get_word("Enter a name: ")
    adjective1 = get_word("Enter an adjective: ")
    adjective2 = get_word("Enter another adjective: ")
    adjective3 = get_word("Enter one more adjective: ")
    noun1 = get_word("Enter a noun: ")
    noun2 = get_word("Enter another noun: ")
    animal = get_word("Enter an animal: ")
    food = get_word("Enter a food: ")

    # Define the story with placeholders for the words
    story = f"""
    Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a {adjective1} person named {name}.
    {name} had a {adjective2} {noun1} and a {adjective3} {noun2}.
    One day, {name} decided to go on a journey to find the legendary {animal}.
    Along the way, {name} encountered many obstacles, but {name} persevered and eventually found the {animal}.
    The {animal} was very {adjective1} and offered {name} a plate of {food} as a reward.
    {name} was overjoyed and returned home with the {food} and a newfound appreciation for the {adjective2} world.
    """

    # Print the story
    print("\nHere is your Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

# Run the Mad Libs game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mad_libs_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Mad Libs game!
I will ask you for some words, and then I will create a story with them.
