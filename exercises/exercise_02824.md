## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the discount amount based on the total price of an item. If the total price is above $100, a 10% discount is applied. If the total price is between $50 and $100, a 5% discount is applied. If the total price is below $50, no discount is applied.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(total_price):
    """
    Calculates the discount amount based on the total price.

    Args:
        total_price (float): The total price of the item.

    Returns:
        float: The discount amount.
    """
    if total_price > 100:
        discount_percentage = 0.10
    elif 50 <= total_price <= 100:
        discount_percentage = 0.05
    else:
        discount_percentage = 0.00

    discount_amount = total_price * discount_percentage
    return discount_amount

def main():
    total_price = float(input("Enter the total price: $"))
    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_price)
    print(f"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Price after discount: ${total_price - discount_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total price: $Discount amount: $3.75
Price after discount: $71.25
```
