## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to calculate the number of ways to make change for a given amount using coins of different denominations.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_change(amount, coins):
    # Create a list to store the number of ways to make change for each amount
    ways = [0] * (amount + 1)
    
    # Base case: there is one way to make change for 0 amount (use no coins)
    ways[0] = 1
    
    # For each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # For each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            # The number of ways to make change for the current amount is the sum of the number of ways to make change for the current amount without using the current coin and the number of ways to make change for the amount minus the current coin
            ways[i] += ways[i - coin]
    
    # Return the number of ways to make change for the given amount
    return ways[amount]

# Example usage:
amount = 10
coins = [1, 5, 10]
print(f"Number of ways to make change for {amount} using coins of denominations {coins}: {calculate_change(amount, coins)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Number of ways to make change for 10 using coins of denominations [1, 5, 10]: 4
```
