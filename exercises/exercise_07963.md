## Reference Solution
```python
def write_to_file(filename, content):
    """
    Writes content to a file.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file.
        content (str): The content to be written to the file.
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print(f"Content written to {filename} successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")


def read_from_file(filename):
    """
    Reads content from a file.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file.

    Returns:
        str: The content of the file.
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        print(f"Content read from {filename} successfully.")
        return content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading from file: {e}")
        return None


def append_to_file(filename, content):
    """
    Appends content to a file.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file.
        content (str): The content to be appended to the file.
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'a') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print(f"Content appended to {filename} successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error appending to file: {e}")


def main():
    filename = "example.txt"
    content = "Hello, World!"

    # Write to file
    write_to_file(filename, content)

    # Read from file
    print(read_from_file(filename))

    # Append to file
    append_to_file(filename, "\nThis is an example.")

    # Read from file again
    print(read_from_file(filename))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Content written to example.txt successfully.
Content read from example.txt successfully.
Hello, World!
Content appended to example.txt successfully.
Content read from example.txt successfully.
Hello, World!
This is an example.
