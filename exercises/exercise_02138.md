## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing tuples.
    Each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): The first input list.
        list2 (list): The second input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.
    """

    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # We use the built-in zip function in Python, which makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
    # The zip function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
    # We convert the result to a list, because the problem requires a list as output.
    combined_list = list(zip(list1, list2))
    
    # Finally, we return the combined list.
    return combined_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(combine_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```

## Generated Output
```
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```
