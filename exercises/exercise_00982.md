## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user inputs their choice, and the program generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'Tie'
    elif (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock') or \
         (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper'):
        return 'User'
    else:
        return 'Computer'

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()
        if user_choice not in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nUser chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'Tie':
            print(f"It's a tie!")
        elif winner == 'User':
            print(f"{user_choice} beats {computer_choice}. You win!")
        else:
            print(f"{computer_choice} beats {user_choice}. Computer wins!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: 
User chose: Rock
Computer chose: Rock

It's a tie!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit:
