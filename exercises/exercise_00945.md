## Exercise
Write a program that prints multiples of 3 from 1 to 30 using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the range
start = 1
end = 30

# Iterate over the range
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    # Check if the number is a multiple of 3
    if i % 3 == 0:
        # Print the multiple of 3
        print(i)
```

```python
# Iterate over the range
for i in range(3, 31, 3):
    # Print the multiple of 3
    print(i)
```

## Generated Output
```
3
6
9
12
15
18
21
24
