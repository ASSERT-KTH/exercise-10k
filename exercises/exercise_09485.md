## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number. If the number is even, it should print 'Even' next to the number. If the number is odd, it should print 'Odd' next to the number.

## Reference Solution
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f'{i} Even')
    else:
        print(f'{i} Odd')
```

## Generated Output
```
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
4 Even
5 Odd
6 Even
7 Odd
8 Even
9 Odd
10 Even
```
