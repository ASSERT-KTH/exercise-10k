## Exercise
Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a single array containing the elements of both arrays, interleaved.

## Reference Solution
```python
from itertools import zip_longest

def interleave_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Interleaves two arrays into a single array.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first array.
        arr2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: A single array containing the elements of both arrays, interleaved.
    """
    # Use zip_longest to iterate over both arrays, filling in None for shorter arrays
    return [item for pair in zip_longest(arr1, arr2) for item in pair if item is not None]

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

result = interleave_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c', 'd']
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c', 'd']
```
