## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and two indices as input, and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second.

## Reference Solution
```python
def slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):
    """
    This function takes a list and two indices as input, 
    and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be sliced.
        start_index (int): The starting index of the slice.
        end_index (int): The ending index of the slice.

    Returns:
        list: A slice of the input list from the start index to the end index.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(input_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Then, we need to check if the start and end indices are integers
    if not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):
        raise TypeError("Start and end indices must be integers")

    # Next, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index
    if start_index > end_index:
        raise ValueError("Start index cannot be greater than end index")

    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to get the desired slice
    # The slicing operation will include all elements up to but not including the end index
    # This is why we don't need to subtract 1 from the end index
    sliced_list = input_list[start_index:end_index]

    # Finally, we return the sliced list
    return sliced_list
```
