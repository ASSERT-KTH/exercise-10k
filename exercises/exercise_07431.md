## Exercise
Create a program that takes in basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and two numbers as input from the user, then outputs the result of the operation. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero.

## Reference Solution
```python
def arithmetic_operation():
    """
    This function takes in basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and two numbers as input from the user,
    then outputs the result of the operation.
    """

    # Take the operation as input from the user
    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

    # Check if the operation is valid
    while operation not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
        print("Invalid operation. Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /")
        operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

    # Take the numbers as input from the user
    while True:
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Perform the operation
    if operation == '+':
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == '-':
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == '*':
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == '/':
        # Check for division by zero
        while num2 == 0:
            print("Cannot divide by zero. Please enter a non-zero number.")
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        result = num1 / num2

    # Print the result
    print(f"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}")

# Call the function
arithmetic_operation()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): Invalid operation. Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpauvvkyw8.py", line 42, in <module>
    arithmetic_operation()
  File "/tmp/tmpauvvkyw8.py", line 13, in arithmetic_operation
    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")
