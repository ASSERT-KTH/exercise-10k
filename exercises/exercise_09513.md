## Exercise
Create a program that validates bank transactions based on the account balance and transaction amount. The program should take two parameters: the current account balance and the transaction amount. If the transaction amount is greater than the account balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the program should print 'Transaction successful' and update the account balance by subtracting the transaction amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_transaction(balance, transaction_amount):
    """
    Validates bank transactions based on the account balance and transaction amount.

    Args:
        balance (float): The current account balance.
        transaction_amount (float): The transaction amount.

    Returns:
        float: The updated account balance if the transaction is successful, otherwise None.
    """

    # Check if the transaction amount is greater than the account balance
    if transaction_amount > balance:
        # If true, print 'Insufficient funds'
        print('Insufficient funds')
        return None
    
    # If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance
    else:
        # Print 'Transaction successful'
        print('Transaction successful')
        
        # Update the account balance by subtracting the transaction amount
        updated_balance = balance - transaction_amount
        
        # Return the updated account balance
        return updated_balance


# Example usage:
balance = 1000.0
transaction_amount = 500.0

updated_balance = validate_transaction(balance, transaction_amount)

if updated_balance is not None:
    print(f'Updated account balance: {updated_balance}')
```

## Generated Output
```
Transaction successful
Updated account balance: 500.0
```
