## Exercise
Write a program that uses multiline strings to create a string that spans multiple lines.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Using triple quotes to create a multiline string
    multiline_string = """
    This is a multiline string that spans multiple lines.
    It can be used to create a string that contains line breaks.
    """

    print(multiline_string)

    # Using the join function to create a multiline string
    lines = ["This is the first line.", "This is the second line.", "This is the third line."]
    multiline_string_join = "\n".join(lines)

    print(multiline_string_join)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
This is a multiline string that spans multiple lines.
    It can be used to create a string that contains line breaks.
