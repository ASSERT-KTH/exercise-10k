## Exercise
Create a program that classifies a student's grade based on their score. The program should take an integer score as input and output the corresponding grade. The grading scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_grade(score):
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if score < 0 or score > 100:
    print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
else:
    print(determine_grade(score))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: B
```
