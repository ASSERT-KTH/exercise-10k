## Exercise
Write a program that takes a day of the week (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day name (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.)

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_day_of_week(day_number):
    """
    Prints the day of the week corresponding to the input day number.
    
    Args:
        day_number (int): The day of the week (1-7) where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input day number is not between 1 and 7.
    """
    
    # Define a dictionary mapping day numbers to day names
    days_of_week = {
        1: "Monday",
        2: "Tuesday",
        3: "Wednesday",
        4: "Thursday",
        5: "Friday",
        6: "Saturday",
        7: "Sunday"
    }
    
    # Check if the input day number is valid
    if day_number not in days_of_week:
        raise ValueError("Invalid day number. Day number should be between 1 and 7.")
    
    # Print the corresponding day name
    print(days_of_week[day_number])


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    day_number = int(input("Enter the day of the week (1-7): "))
    print_day_of_week(day_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the day of the week (1-7): Wednesday
```
