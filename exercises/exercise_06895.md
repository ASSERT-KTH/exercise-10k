## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a string representing a mathematical expression involving basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and evaluates its validity. The program should check if the expression is mathematically correct and does not result in division by zero. If the expression is valid, the program should calculate and return the result of the expression.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing Libraries
import re

# Defining the Function
def solve(expression):
    # Checking for Division by Zero
    if '/0' in expression:
        return 'Division by zero'

    # Evaluating the Expression
    try:
        result = eval(expression)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

# Test the Function
print(solve("1 + 2 * 3"))  # Output: 7
print(solve("1 + 2 / 0"))  # Output: Division by zero
```

## Generated Output
```
7
division by zero
```
