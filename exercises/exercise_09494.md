## Exercise
Create a program that checks the grade of a student based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score"

    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function
def main():
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
