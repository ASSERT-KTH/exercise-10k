## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers from both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function combines two lists of integers into a new list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list of integers.
        list2 (list): The second list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all the integers from both input lists.
    """
    # Combine the two lists into a new list
    combined_list = list1 + list2
    
    # Return the combined list
    return combined_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = combine_lists(list1, list2)
print(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
