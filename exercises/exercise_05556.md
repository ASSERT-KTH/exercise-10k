## Exercise
Write a program that prints the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Get the number from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if number is non-negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
else:
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: Factorial of 5 is 120
```
