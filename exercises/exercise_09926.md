## Exercise
Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the computer's number. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    computer_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    print("Welcome to the guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("What's your guess? ")
        
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, I'll stop playing. The number was {}.".format(computer_number))
            break
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number. Please try again.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == computer_number:
            print("Congratulations! You've guessed the number in {} attempts.".format(attempts))
            break
        elif user_guess < computer_number:
            print("Your guess is too low. Try again!")
        else:
            print("Your guess is too high. Try again!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
What's your guess? Your guess is too high. Try again!
What's your guess?
