## Exercise
Write a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula (e.g., Fibonacci sequence).

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
print(fib_sequence)
```

```python
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
