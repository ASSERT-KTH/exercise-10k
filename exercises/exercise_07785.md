## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string input from the user, checks if it's a palindrome, and then reverses the string. If the string is a palindrome, print 'The string is a palindrome' before printing the reversed string. Otherwise, just print the reversed string.

## Reference Solution
```python
s = input("Enter a string: ")
if s == s[::-1]:
    print("The string is a palindrome")
print(s[::-1])
```

## Generated Output
