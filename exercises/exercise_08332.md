## Exercise
You are given a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades in different subjects. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has no grades, print 'No grades available'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade(student_grades):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each student.

    Args:
    student_grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades in different subjects.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    for student, grades in student_grades.items():
        if not grades:
            print(f"{student}: No grades available")
        else:
            average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
            print(f"{student}: {average_grade:.2f}")

def main():
    # Example usage
    student_grades = {
        "John": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78},
        "Alice": {"Math": 92, "Science": 88, "English": 95},
        "Bob": {},
        "Charlie": {"Math": 76, "Science": 85, "English": 90}
    }

    calculate_average_grade(student_grades)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
John: 84.33
Alice: 91.67
Bob: No grades available
Charlie: 83.67
```
