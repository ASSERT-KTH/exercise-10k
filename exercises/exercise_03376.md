## Exercise
Use a for loop to find the most frequent element in a given list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def most_frequent_element(numbers):
    """
    Find the most frequent element in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The most frequent element in the list.
    """
    frequency = {}
    max_frequency = 0
    most_frequent = None

    # Count the frequency of each element
    for num in numbers:
        if num in frequency:
            frequency[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency[num] = 1

        # Update the most frequent element if necessary
        if frequency[num] > max_frequency:
            max_frequency = frequency[num]
            most_frequent = num

    return most_frequent


# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
print(most_frequent_element(numbers))  # Output: 4
```

## Generated Output
