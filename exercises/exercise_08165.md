    """
    return array.count(target)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an array of 5 integers
    array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]

    # Specify the target element
    target = 2

    # Count the occurrences of the target element
    occurrences = count_occurrences(array, target)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The element {target} occurs {occurrences} times in the array.")
