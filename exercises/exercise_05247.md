## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1

    # Calculate the distance using the Euclidean distance formula
    distance = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)

    return distance

def main():
    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
    y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: "))

    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)

    # Print the result
    print("The distance between the two points is: ", distance)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpugg7vyjp.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpugg7vyjp.py", line 27, in main
    x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '(1, 2) (4, 6)'
```
