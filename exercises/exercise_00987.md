## Exercise
Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on the user's input. The program should use if-else statements to determine which operation to perform.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, choice;
    char ch;

    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> num1;

    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> num2;

    cout << "Enter your choice: ";
    cin >> choice;

    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            cout << "Sum: " << num1 + num2 << endl;
            break;
        case 2:
            cout << "Difference: " << num1 - num2 << endl;
            break;
        case 3:
            cout << "Product: " << num1 * num2 << endl;
            break;
        case 4:
            if (num2 != 0) {
                cout << "Quotient: " << num1 / num2 << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed." << endl;
            }
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid choice. Please try again." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
