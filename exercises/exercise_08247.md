## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors using if/else statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game."""
    if player_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
         (player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    player_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while player_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        player_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose {player_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.")

    result = determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
