## Exercise
Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its volume.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_sphere_volume(radius):
    """
    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the sphere.
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")

    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    return volume

def main():
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
    try:
        volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)
        print(f"The volume of the sphere is: {volume:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the radius of the sphere: The volume of the sphere is: 523.60
```
