## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and prints their mean, median, and mode.

## Reference Solution
```python
import statistics

def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    # Calculate mean
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate median
    median = statistics.median(numbers)
    
    # Calculate mode
    try:
        mode = statistics.mode(numbers)
    except statistics.StatisticsError:
        mode = "No unique mode found"
    
    return mean, median, mode

def main():
    # Get a list of numbers from the user
    input_str = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    numbers = [float(num) for num in input_str.split()]
    
    # Calculate and print statistics
    mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Mode: {mode}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: Mean: 3.0
Median: 3.0
Mode: 1.0
```
