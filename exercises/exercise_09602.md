## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Asks the user for their choice and returns it"""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): ")
        if user_choice.capitalize() in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:
            return user_choice.capitalize()
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock'):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

def main():
    """Main function to start the game"""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    play_again = 'y'
    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): 
You chose: Rock
Computer chose: Rock
It's a tie!

Do you want to play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmplyk7aqf7.py", line 44, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmplyk7aqf7.py", line 40, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
