## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices. Additionally, the program should print the first three elements of the array and the last three elements of the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])

# Calculate sum of even and odd indices
even_sum = np.sum(x[::2])
odd_sum = np.sum(x[1::2])

# Print sums
print("Sum of elements at even indices:", even_sum)
print("Sum of elements at odd indices:", odd_sum)

# Print first and last three elements
print("First three elements:", x[:3])
print("Last three elements:", x[-3:])
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of elements at even indices: 64
Sum of elements at odd indices: 56
First three elements: [1 2 3]
Last three elements: [13 14 15]
```
