## Exercise
Write a program that checks the day of the week (1-7) and prints the corresponding day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.)

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_day_of_week(day):
    """
    Prints the day of the week corresponding to the given day number (1-7).
    
    Args:
        day (int): The day of the week (1-7), where 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday.
    """
    days_of_week = {
        1: "Monday",
        2: "Tuesday",
        3: "Wednesday",
        4: "Thursday",
        5: "Friday",
        6: "Saturday",
        7: "Sunday"
    }

    if day in days_of_week:
        print(days_of_week[day])
    else:
        print("Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.")

def main():
    # Example usage:
    day = int(input("Enter the day of the week (1-7): "))
    print_day_of_week(day)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
