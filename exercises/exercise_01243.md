## Exercise
Write two functions, one that calculates the square of a number and another that calculates the cube of a number, then use these functions to calculate the square of the cube of a number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_square(num):
    """
    Calculate the square of a number.

    Args:
        num (float): The number to calculate the square of.

    Returns:
        float: The square of the number.
    """
    return num ** 2

def calculate_cube(num):
    """
    Calculate the cube of a number.

    Args:
        num (float): The number to calculate the cube of.

    Returns:
        float: The cube of the number.
    """
    return num ** 3

def main():
    num = 5  # Example number
    cube = calculate_cube(num)
    square_of_cube = calculate_square(cube)

    print(f"The cube of {num} is: {cube}")
    print(f"The square of the cube of {num} is: {square_of_cube}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The cube of 5 is: 125
The square of the cube of 5 is: 15625
```
