## Exercise
Write a program that uses loops to generate a specific pattern. The pattern consists of a series of numbers that increase by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, and decrease by 1 for each iteration of the inner loop. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The pattern should be repeated for the number of rows specified by the input.

## Reference Solution
```python
n = 5

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    for j in range(i-1, 0, -1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    print()
```

## Generated Output
```
1 
1 2 1 
1 2 3 2 1 
1 2 3 4 3 2 1 
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
```
