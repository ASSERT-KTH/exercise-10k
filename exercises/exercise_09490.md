## Exercise
Write a program to find the maximum value in a list of integers. The program should take a list of integers as input, iterate through the list, and return the maximum value.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Create a list of integers
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

# Define a variable to store the maximum value
max_value = numbers[0]

# Iterate through the list of numbers
for number in numbers:
    # Check if each number is greater than the current max_value
    if number > max_value:
        # If it is, update max_value to be the current number
        max_value = number

# Print the maximum value
print(max_value)
```

## Generated Output
```
19
```
