## Exercise
Write a function that uses a lambda expression to filter a list of numbers. Then, call this function with a list of input numbers and print the filtered list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
    """
    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns a boolean.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the condition.
    """
    return list(filter(condition, numbers))


def main():
    # Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Use a lambda expression to filter even numbers
    even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)

    # Print the filtered list
    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)

    # Use a lambda expression to filter numbers greater than 5
    numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)

    # Print the filtered list
    print("Numbers greater than 5:", numbers_greater_than_5)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Numbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
