## Exercise
Create a function that returns a closure that captures a variable from the surrounding scope

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(var):
    """
    Returns a closure that captures the variable from the surrounding scope.
    
    Args:
    var: The variable to be captured by the closure.
    
    Returns:
    A closure function that takes no arguments and returns the captured variable.
    """
    def inner_function():
        # This function has access to the variables in the surrounding scope
        return var
    
    return inner_function

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a closure that captures the variable "hello"
    closure = outer_function("hello")
    
    # Call the closure to retrieve the captured variable
    print(closure())  # Output: hello
```

```python
x = 10
closure = outer_function(x)
print(closure())  # Output: 10

x = 20
print(closure())  # Output: 20
```

```python
def outer_function(var):
    def inner_function(var=var):
        return var
    
    return inner_function
```

## Generated Output

hello
```
