## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly, with a limited number of attempts.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 5

while attempts > 0:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
    attempts -= 1

    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Higher!")
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Lower!")
    else:
        print("You guessed it!")
        break

if attempts == 0:
    print("You ran out of guesses!")
    print("The secret number was", secret_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number: Lower!
Guess a number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmphi34oph1.py", line 7, in <module>
    guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
