## Exercise
Create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user can play against the computer. The computer's choice should be randomly generated.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate the computer's choice randomly."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'user'
    else:
        return 'computer'

def play_game():
    """Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game."""
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer's choice: {computer_choice}")

    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == 'tie':
        print(f"It's a tie! Both chose {user_choice}.")
    elif winner == 'user':
        print(f"You win! {user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}.")
    else:
        print(f"Computer wins! {computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}.")

def main():
    play_again = 'yes'
    while play_again.lower() == 'yes':
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Computer's choice: paper
Computer wins! Paper beats rock.

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8x4fxxc5.py", line 44, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp8x4fxxc5.py", line 40, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
