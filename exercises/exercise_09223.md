## Exercise
Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.
    
    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.
    
    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Get the student's score from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                break
            else:
                print("Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is {grade}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is B.
```
