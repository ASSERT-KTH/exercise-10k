## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it's a palindrome. If the string is not a palindrome, reverse it and return the reversed string. If the string is a palindrome, return 'Palindrome' along with the original string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_palindrome(s):
    """
    Checks if the input string is a palindrome. 
    If it's not, returns the reversed string. 
    If it's a palindrome, returns 'Palindrome' along with the original string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The result based on whether the string is a palindrome or not.
    """
    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s = s.strip().lower()

    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    if s == s[::-1]:
        # If it's a palindrome, return 'Palindrome' along with the original string
        return f'Palindrome: {s}'
    else:
        # If it's not a palindrome, return the reversed string
        return s[::-1]


# Example usage:
print(check_palindrome("radar"))  # Output: Palindrome: radar
print(check_palindrome("hello"))  # Output: olleh
```

## Generated Output
```
Palindrome: radar
olleh
```
