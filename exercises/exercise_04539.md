## Exercise
Write a program that takes a 2D array as input and returns the transposed array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose(matrix):
    """
    Returns the transpose of a given 2D array.

    Args:
        matrix (list): A 2D list of elements.

    Returns:
        list: The transposed 2D list.
    """
    return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a sample 2D array
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    # Print the original matrix
    print("Original Matrix:")
    for row in matrix:
        print(row)

    # Transpose the matrix
    transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)

    # Print the transposed matrix
    print("\nTransposed Matrix:")
    for row in transposed_matrix:
        print(row)
```

```python
import numpy as np

def transpose(matrix):
    return np.transpose(matrix).tolist()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    matrix = np.array([
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ])

    transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)
    print(transposed_matrix)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original Matrix:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Transposed Matrix:
[1, 4, 7]
[2, 5, 8]
[3, 6, 9]
```
