## Exercise
Create a program that takes user input for grades and calculates the average grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade():
    """
    Calculate the average grade from user input.
    """
    grades = []
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))

    # Get user input for grades
    for i in range(num_grades):
        while True:
            try:
                grade = float(input(f"Enter grade {i+1}: "))
                if 0 <= grade <= 100:
                    grades.append(grade)
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid grade. Please enter a grade between 0 and 100.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate average grade
    average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)

    # Print average grade
    print(f"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}")

def main():
    calculate_average_grade()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of grades: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp0p1k85ci.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp0p1k85ci.py", line 28, in main
    calculate_average_grade()
  File "/tmp/tmp0p1k85ci.py", line 6, in calculate_average_grade
    num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '90, 80, 70'
