## Exercise
Write a program that determines the winner of a game based on the scores. If the user's score is higher than the computer's score, the user wins. If the computer's score is higher than the user's score, the computer wins. If the scores are tied, the game is a tie.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_winner(user_score, computer_score):
    """
    Determine the winner of a game based on the scores.

    Args:
        user_score (int): The user's score.
        computer_score (int): The computer's score.

    Returns:
        str: The result of the game.
    """
    if user_score > computer_score:
        return "User wins!"
    elif user_score < computer_score:
        return "Computer wins!"
    else:
        return "It's a tie!"

def main():
    user_score = int(input("Enter the user's score: "))
    computer_score = int(input("Enter the computer's score: "))

    result = determine_winner(user_score, computer_score)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the user's score: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmt34t3e0.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmt34t3e0.py", line 20, in main
    user_score = int(input("Enter the user's score: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '100 80'
```
