Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum

## Reference Solution
```python

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 7
    result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
```
