## Exercise
Write a program that takes a range of numbers as input, calculates the Fibonacci numbers within that range, and prints them out.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the function fibonachi
def fibonachi(start, end):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= end:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return [num for num in fib_sequence if start <= num <= end]

# Define the function main
def main():
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
    end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))
    result = fibonachi(start, end)
    print("Fibonacci numbers in the range:", result)

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the start of the range: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6uxj_2je.py", line 17, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6uxj_2je.py", line 10, in main
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 10'
```
