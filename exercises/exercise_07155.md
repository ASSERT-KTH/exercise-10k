## Exercise
Write a program that takes in two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input from the user and performs the specified operation. The program should handle invalid inputs and provide a clear error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program is designed to take in two numbers and an operator as input from the user.
# It then performs the operation on the two numbers based on the operator provided.

# Importing the operator module
import operator

# Defining a function to perform the operation
def perform_operation(num1, operator, num2):
    try:
        # Checking if the operator is valid
        if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
            raise ValueError("Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.")
        
        # Performing the operation
        if operator == '+':
            result = num1 + num2
        elif operator == '-':
            result = num1 - num2
        elif operator == '*':
            result = num1 * num2
        elif operator == '/':
            if num2 == 0:
                raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
            result = num1 / num2
        
        # Returning the result
        return result
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling any exceptions that may occur
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Defining a main function to get user input and perform the operation
def main():
    print("Welcome to the calculator program!")
    
    # Getting user input
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    operator = input("Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Performing the operation and printing the result
    result = perform_operation(num1, operator, num2)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}")

# Running the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the calculator program!
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpyo_uuicd.py", line 50, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpyo_uuicd.py", line 39, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 + 5'
```
