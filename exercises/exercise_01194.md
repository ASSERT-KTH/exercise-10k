## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints out their sum, difference, product, and quotient using helper functions.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Version: 1.0
# Description: This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations on them.

def sum(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers"""
    return a + b

def difference(a, b):
    """Returns the difference of two numbers"""
    return a - b

def product(a, b):
    """Returns the product of two numbers"""
    return a * b

def quotient(a, b):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers"""
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    return a / b

def main():
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum(num1, num2)}")
    print(f"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is: {difference(num1, num2)}")
    print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {product(num1, num2)}")
    print(f"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is: {quotient(num1, num2)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbejmy388.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpbejmy388.py", line 25, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 2'
```
