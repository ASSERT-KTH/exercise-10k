## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the variance of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers"""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def calculate_variance(numbers):
    """Calculate the variance of a list of numbers"""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    squared_diffs = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]
    return sum(squared_diffs) / (len(numbers) - 1)


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    print(f"The variance of the list {numbers} is: {variance}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The variance of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is: 2.5
```
