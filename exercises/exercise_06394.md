## Exercise
Develop a program that takes in the user's choice and the computer's choice, then determines the winner. Use if/else statements to compare the choices and determine the winner

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Returns the winner based on the user's and computer's choices."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): Invalid choice. Please try again.
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
