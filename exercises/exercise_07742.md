## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades. The program should then calculate the average grade of all students and print out the student with the highest grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest grade, print out all of them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_and_highest_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    Calculate the average grade of all students and print out the student(s) with the highest grade.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not grades_dict:
        print("No students in the dictionary.")
        return

    # Calculate the average grade
    average_grade = sum(grades_dict.values()) / len(grades_dict)

    # Find the highest grade
    highest_grade = max(grades_dict.values())

    # Find all students with the highest grade
    highest_graders = [name for name, grade in grades_dict.items() if grade == highest_grade]

    # Print the results
    print(f"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}")
    if len(highest_graders) == 1:
        print(f"The student with the highest grade is {highest_graders[0]} with a grade of {highest_grade}.")
    else:
        print(f"The students with the highest grade are {', '.join(highest_graders)} with a grade of {highest_grade}.")


# Example usage:
grades_dict = {
    "John": 85,
    "Alice": 90,
    "Bob": 80,
    "Charlie": 90,
    "David": 75
}

calculate_average_and_highest_grades(grades_dict)
```

## Generated Output
```
Average grade: 84.00
The students with the highest grade are Alice, Charlie with a grade of 90.
```
