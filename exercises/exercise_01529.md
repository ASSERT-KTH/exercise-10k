## Exercise
Write a program that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

    Args:
    arr (list): The input array to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted array.
    """

    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)

    # Iterate through the array n-1 times
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made
        swapped = False

        # Iterate through the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True

        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    return arr


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an example array
    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

    # Print the original array
    print("Original array:", arr)

    # Sort the array using Bubble Sort
    sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)

    # Print the sorted array
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
