## Exercise
Create a program that takes a time in hours and minutes as input and prints out the equivalent time in seconds.

## Reference Solution
```python
def time_to_seconds(hours, minutes):
    """
    Convert time from hours and minutes to seconds.

    Args:
        hours (int): Hours
        minutes (int): Minutes

    Returns:
        int: Time in seconds
    """
    seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60)
    return seconds

def main():
    # Get user input
    hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
    minutes = int(input("Enter minutes: "))

    # Convert time to seconds
    seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes)

    # Print result
    print(f"{hours} hours and {minutes} minutes is equal to {seconds} seconds.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter hours: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbilb3xwy.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpbilb3xwy.py", line 17, in main
    hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1, 30'
```
