## Exercise
Create a function to check if a given number is a power of 2 or not

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a given integer is a power of 2.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a power of 2, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 3, 5, 6, 10]
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"{num} is a power of 2: {is_power_of_two(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
1 is a power of 2: True
2 is a power of 2: True
4 is a power of 2: True
8 is a power of 2: True
16 is a power of 2: True
3 is a power of 2: False
5 is a power of 2: False
6 is a power of 2: False
10 is a power of 2: False
```
