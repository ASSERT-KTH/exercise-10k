## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a year and outputs whether it is a leap year or not based on the following conditions: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.
# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, 
# unless it is also divisible by 400.

def is_leap_year(year):
    """
    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            return year % 400 == 0
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
print("The year", year, "is a leap year" if is_leap_year(year) else "The year", year, "is not a leap year")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: The year 2020 is a leap year 2020 is not a leap year
```
