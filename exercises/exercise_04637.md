## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns the symmetric difference between the two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    This function calculates the symmetric difference between two input arrays.
    
    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first input array.
        arr2 (list): The second input array.
    
    Returns:
        list: The symmetric difference between arr1 and arr2.
    """
    
    # Convert input lists to sets for efficient set operations
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)
    
    # Calculate the symmetric difference using set operations
    symmetric_diff = (set1 - set2) | (set2 - set1)
    
    # Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it
    return list(symmetric_diff)


# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

print(symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
```
