## Exercise
Develop a program that generates a word scramble game. The program should take a list of words, scramble each word, and ask the user to unscramble it. After each guess, provide feedback (e.g., 'correct' or 'incorrect').

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def scramble_word(word):
    """
    Scrambles a given word by shuffling its characters.
    
    Args:
    word (str): The word to scramble.
    
    Returns:
    str: The scrambled word.
    """
    word_list = list(word)
    random.shuffle(word_list)
    return ''.join(word_list)

def word_scramble_game(words):
    """
    Generates a word scramble game by scrambling each word and asking the user to unscramble it.
    
    Args:
    words (list): A list of words to scramble.
    """
    score = 0
    total_words = len(words)
    
    for word in words:
        scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)
        print(f"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}")
        guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
        
        if guess.lower() == word.lower():
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer was {word}.\n")
    
    print(f"Game over! Your final score is {score}/{total_words}.")

def main():
    words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
    word_scramble_game(words)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Unscramble the word: paelp
Enter your guess: Incorrect. The correct answer was apple.

Unscramble the word: aanabn
Enter your guess: 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
