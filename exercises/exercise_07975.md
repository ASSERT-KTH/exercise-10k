## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")

    return math.factorial(n)

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    try:
        factorial = calculate_factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The factorial of 5 is 120
