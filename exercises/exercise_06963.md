## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True if it is odd and False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_odd(n):
    """
    This function checks if a given number is odd or not.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is odd, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is an integer. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")

    # Now, we use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
    # If the remainder is 1, the number is odd. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
    remainder = n % 2
    
    # We then use a conditional statement to return True if the remainder is 1 and False otherwise.
    # This is equivalent to saying: return remainder == 1.
    return remainder == 1
```
