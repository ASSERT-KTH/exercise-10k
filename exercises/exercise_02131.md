## Exercise
Create a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all elements from both arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all elements from both arrays.

    Parameters:
    arr1 (list): The first input array.
    arr2 (list): The second input array.

    Returns:
    list: A new array containing all elements from both input arrays.
    """

    # First, we check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(arr1, list) or not isinstance(arr2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # We initialize an empty list to store the combined array.
    # This list will be returned at the end of the function.
    combined_array = []

    # We use the extend method to add all elements from the first array to the combined array.
    # This is more efficient than using the + operator because it modifies the list in-place.
    combined_array.extend(arr1)

    # We use the extend method again to add all elements from the second array to the combined array.
    combined_array.extend(arr2)

    # Finally, we return the combined array.
    return combined_array

# Example usage:
array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]
print(combine_arrays(array1, array2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
