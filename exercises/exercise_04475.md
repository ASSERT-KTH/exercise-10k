## Exercise
Write a program to find the sum of elements in a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a while loop

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_condition_met(lst, condition_value):
    """
    Calculate the sum of elements in a list that meet a specific condition.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers.
        condition_value (int): The value used for the condition.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of elements meeting the condition.
    """
    index = 0
    total_sum = 0
    while index < len(lst):
        # Check if the current element meets the condition
        if lst[index] > condition_value:
            # If it does, add it to the total sum
            total_sum += lst[index]
        # Move to the next element
        index += 1
    return total_sum

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
condition_value = 3
result = sum_condition_met(numbers, condition_value)
print(f"Sum of numbers greater than {condition_value}: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of numbers greater than 3: 39
```
