## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it's a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print 'Valid Palindrome' along with the reversed string. If it's not a palindrome, the program should print 'Not a Palindrome' and the original string.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user input
s = input("Enter a string: ")

# Reverse the string
s1 = s[::-1]

# Check if the string is a palindrome
if s1 == s:
    print("Valid Palindrome")
    print(s1)
else:
    print("Not a Palindrome")
    print(s)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Valid Palindrome
madam
```
