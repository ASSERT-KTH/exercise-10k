## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. If the score is above 90, print 'A', between 80 and 90 print 'B', between 70 and 80 print 'C', between 60 and 70 print 'D', and below 60 print 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculates a student's grade based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Get the student's score
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Validate the score
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        # Calculate and print the student's grade
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"Student's grade: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: Student's grade: B
```
