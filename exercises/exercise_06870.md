## Exercise
Write a program that checks the data type of a given variable and prints out whether it is an integer, float, string, or boolean. The program should handle all four data types and provide a clear output message for each.

## Reference Solution
```python
var = 10
# var = 2.2
# var = "Hello, world!"
# var = True

if type(var) == int:
    print("Variable is an integer")
elif type(var) == float:
    print("Variable is a float")
elif type(var) == str:
    print("Variable is a string")
elif type(var) == bool:
    print("Variable is a boolean")
```

## Generated Output
```
Variable is an integer
```
