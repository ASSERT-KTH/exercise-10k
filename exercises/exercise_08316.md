## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers within a given range (inclusive) using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, both of which are integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_numbers(start, end):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        sum = sum + i
    return sum

def main():
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
    end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))
    result = sum_numbers(start, end)
    print(f"The sum of the numbers in the range is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the start of the range: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6rj8wfqm.py", line 14, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6rj8wfqm.py", line 8, in main
    start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 5'
```
