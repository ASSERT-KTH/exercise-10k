## Exercise
Given a dictionary, write a function to access and print a specific value by its key

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    Access and print a dictionary value by its key.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.
        key (any): The key of the value to access.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        value = dictionary[key]
        print(f"The value for key '{key}' is: {value}")
    except KeyError:
        print(f"Key '{key}' not found in the dictionary.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
    key_to_access = "age"
    
    print_dict_value(example_dict, key_to_access)
```
