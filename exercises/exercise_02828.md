## Exercise
Create a program to determine whether a student is eligible to attend a particular course based on their age and marks. If the student's age is above 18 and their marks are above 50, they are eligible.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_eligibility(age, marks):
    """
    Checks if a student is eligible to attend a course based on their age and marks.

    Args:
        age (int): The student's age.
        marks (int): The student's marks.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the student is eligible, False otherwise.
    """
    if age > 18 and marks > 50:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    # Get student's age and marks
    age = int(input("Enter the student's age: "))
    marks = int(input("Enter the student's marks: "))

    # Check eligibility
    eligible = check_eligibility(age, marks)

    # Print result
    if eligible:
        print("The student is eligible to attend the course.")
    else:
        print("The student is not eligible to attend the course.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqjmvu225.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqjmvu225.py", line 19, in main
    age = int(input("Enter the student's age: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '20 60'
