## Exercise
Develop a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the players' choices as input and determine the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_player_choice(player_name):
    """
    Get the player's choice and validate it.
    
    Args:
        player_name (str): The name of the player.
    
    Returns:
        str: The player's choice.
    """
    while True:
        choice = input(f"{player_name}, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
        if choice.lower() in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return choice.lower()
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


def determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):
    """
    Determine the winner based on the game's rules.
    
    Args:
        player1_choice (str): The choice of player 1.
        player2_choice (str): The choice of player 2.
    
    Returns:
        str: The name of the winner, or "tie" if it's a tie.
    """
    if player1_choice == player2_choice:
        return "tie"
    elif (player1_choice == "rock" and player2_choice == "scissors") or \
         (player1_choice == "scissors" and player2_choice == "paper") or \
         (player1_choice == "paper" and player2_choice == "rock"):
        return "player1"
    else:
        return "player2"


def main():
    """
    The main function of the program.
    """
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    
    player1_name = input("Enter player 1's name: ")
    player2_name = input("Enter player 2's name: ")
    
    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name)
    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name)
    
    winner = determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice)
    
    if winner == "tie":
        print(f"It's a tie! Both {player1_name} and {player2_name} chose {player1_choice}.")
    elif winner == "player1":
        print(f"{player1_name} wins! {player1_choice} beats {player2_choice}.")
    else:
        print(f"{player2_name} wins! {player2_choice} beats {player1_choice}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter player 1's name: Enter player 2's name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmphl9p9usv.py", line 63, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmphl9p9usv.py", line 47, in main
    player2_name = input("Enter player 2's name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
