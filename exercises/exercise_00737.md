## Exercise
Write a program that takes a time in seconds as input and outputs its equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Reference Solution
```python

    """
    Converts time in seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.

    Args:
        seconds (int): Time in seconds.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing hours, minutes, and seconds.
    """
    hours = seconds // 3600
    minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    seconds = seconds % 60
    return hours, minutes, seconds

def main():
    # Get input from user
    seconds = int(input("Enter time in seconds: "))

    # Convert time
    hours, minutes, seconds = convert_time(seconds)

    # Print result
    print(f"{hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, {seconds} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
