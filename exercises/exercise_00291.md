## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the time given the hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_time(hours, minutes, seconds):
    """
    Calculate the total time in seconds given hours, minutes, and seconds.

    Args:
        hours (int): The hours component of the time.
        minutes (int): The minutes component of the time.
        seconds (int): The seconds component of the time.

    Returns:
        int: The total time in seconds.
    """
    # Calculate the total seconds
    total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds

    return total_seconds


def main():
    # Get user input
    hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
    minutes = int(input("Enter minutes: "))
    seconds = int(input("Enter seconds: "))

    # Calculate the time
    total_seconds = calculate_time(hours, minutes, seconds)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The total time is {total_seconds} seconds.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter hours: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpd9_m_a1k.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpd9_m_a1k.py", line 21, in main
    hours = int(input("Enter hours: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 30 45'
