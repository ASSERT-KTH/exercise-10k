## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
    
    Args:
        a (int or float): The first number.
        b (int or float): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the sum
    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(a, b)
    print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum_of_numbers}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpnobj80vw.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpnobj80vw.py", line 16, in main
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
