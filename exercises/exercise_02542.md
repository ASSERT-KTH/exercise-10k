## Exercise
Create a function that takes two arguments, one with a default value, and returns their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function named 'sum_two_numbers' that takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b'.
# The argument 'b' has a default value of 0, which means it's optional when calling the function.
def sum_two_numbers(a, b=0):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first number to be added.
        b (int, optional): The second number to be added. Defaults to 0.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of 'a' and 'b'.
    """
    
    # Check if both 'a' and 'b' are integers.
    # If not, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message.
    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        raise TypeError("Both arguments must be integers.")
    
    # Calculate the sum of 'a' and 'b' using the '+' operator.
    # The result will be stored in the 'total' variable.
    total = a + b
    
    # Return the calculated sum.
    return total

# Test the function with some examples.
print(sum_two_numbers(5, 10))  # Output: 15
print(sum_two_numbers(7))     # Output: 7
```

## Generated Output
```
15
7
```
