## Exercise
Write a program that determines the day of the week based on the date. If the date is between Monday and Friday, the day is a weekday. If the date is Saturday or Sunday, the day is a weekend day.

## Reference Solution
```python
import datetime

def is_weekday(year, month, day):
    """
    Determine whether a given date is a weekday or not.

    Args:
        year (int): The year of the date.
        month (int): The month of the date.
        day (int): The day of the date.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the date is a weekday, False otherwise.
    """
    date = datetime.date(year, month, day)
    return date.weekday() < 5  # Monday is 0 and Friday is 4

def main():
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month: "))
    day = int(input("Enter the day: "))

    if is_weekday(year, month, day):
        print(f"{year}-{month}-{day} is a weekday.")
    else:
        print(f"{year}-{month}-{day} is a weekend day.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the year: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqcnfjid6.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqcnfjid6.py", line 19, in main
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2022-09-01'
```
