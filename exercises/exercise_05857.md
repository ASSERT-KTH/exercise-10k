## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a student's name and grade, and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the grade is A, print 'Excellent'; if the grade is B, print 'Good'; if the grade is C, print 'Fair'; if the grade is D or F, print 'Needs improvement'

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_grade(grade):
    """
    Evaluates the given grade and returns a corresponding message.
    
    Parameters:
    grade (str): The student's grade.
    
    Returns:
    str: A message based on the grade.
    """
    if grade.upper() == 'A':
        return 'Excellent'
    elif grade.upper() == 'B':
        return 'Good'
    elif grade.upper() == 'C':
        return 'Fair'
    elif grade.upper() in ['D', 'F']:
        return 'Needs improvement'
    else:
        return 'Invalid grade'

def main():
    # Ask the user for the student's name
    name = input("Please enter the student's name: ")
    
    # Ask the user for the student's grade
    grade = input("Please enter the student's grade (A, B, C, D, F): ")
    
    # Evaluate the grade and print the result
    message = evaluate_grade(grade)
    print(f"{name}'s grade is {grade}. {message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the student's name: Please enter the student's grade (A, B, C, D, F):
