## Exercise
Create a program that takes a character as input and uses if/else statements to check if it's a vowel.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_vowel(char):
    """Check if a character is a vowel."""
    char = char.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for simplicity
    if char in 'aeiou':
        print(f"'{char}' is a vowel.")
    else:
        print(f"'{char}' is not a vowel.")

# Get user input
char = input("Enter a character: ")

# Check if the input is a single character
if len(char) == 1:
    check_vowel(char)
else:
    print("Please enter a single character.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a character: 'a' is a vowel.
```
