## Exercise
Create a function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is less than 0.
    """

    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Check if n is negative
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    return n * factorial(n-1)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    try:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
