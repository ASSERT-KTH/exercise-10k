## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student grades where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student's name as the key and their average grade as the value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades):
    """
    Calculates the average grade for each student based on their grades in different subjects.
    
    Parameters:
    grades (dict): A dictionary of student grades where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with the average grade for each student.
    """
    average_grades = {}
    for student, subject_grades in grades.items():
        average_grade = sum(subject_grades.values()) / len(subject_grades)
        average_grades[student] = average_grade
    return average_grades

# Example usage
grades = {
    "John": {"Math": 80, "English": 90, "Science": 70},
    "Alice": {"Math": 90, "English": 85, "Science": 95},
    "Bob": {"Math": 70, "English": 80, "Science": 85}
}

result = calculate_average_grades(grades)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 80.0, 'Alice': 90.0, 'Bob': 78.33333333333333}
```
