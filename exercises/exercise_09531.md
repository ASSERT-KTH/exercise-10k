## Exercise
Create a function that takes a 2D array and a target value as input, then returns the row and column indices of the target value if found. If the target value is not found, return a message indicating that the value is not present in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_target(array, target):
    """
    This function searches for a target value in a 2D array and returns its indices.
    
    Args:
        array (list): A 2D list of values.
        target: The value to be searched in the array.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: The row and column indices of the target value if found. Otherwise, a message indicating that the value is not present in the array.
    """

    # Iterate over each row in the array
    for i, row in enumerate(array):
        
        # Check if the target value is in the current row
        if target in row:
            
            # If the target value is found, return its indices
            return (i, row.index(target))
    
    # If the target value is not found after iterating over all rows, return a message indicating that the value is not present
    return "Target value not found in the array"


# Example usage:
array = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
target = 5
print(find_target(array, target))  # Output: (1, 1)

target = 10
print(find_target(array, target))  # Output: Target value not found in the array
```

## Generated Output
```
(1, 1)
Target value not found in the array
```
