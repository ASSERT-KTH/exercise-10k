## Exercise
Write a program that unpacks a given list of variables into separate variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
def unpack_variables(variables):
    """
    Unpacks a given list of variables into separate variables.

    Args:
        variables (list): A list of variables to be unpacked.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the unpacked variables.
    """

    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(variables, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Use the * operator to unpack the list into separate variables
    # The * operator unpacks the list and assigns the values to the variables
    # However, we cannot directly assign the values to variables because the number of variables is dynamic
    # So, we use the * operator with the tuple function to unpack the list into a tuple
    # This way, we can return the tuple and let the caller unpack it into separate variables
    unpacked_variables = tuple(variables)

    # Return the unpacked variables as a tuple
    return unpacked_variables

# Example usage:
variables = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
unpacked = unpack_variables(variables)

# Now, we can unpack the tuple into separate variables
a, b, c, d, e = unpacked

print(a)  # prints: 1
print(b)  # prints: 2
print(c)  # prints: 3
print(d)  # prints: 4
print(e)  # prints: 5
```

## Generated Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
