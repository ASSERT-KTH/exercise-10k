## Exercise
Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors with the user. The user should be able to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and the program should generate a random choice. The program should then determine the winner and print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def game():
    user = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
    possibleChoices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    computer = random.choice(possibleChoices)

    print(f"\nYou chose {user}, computer chose {computer}.\n")

    if user == computer:
        return "It's a tie!"

    if is_win(user, computer):
        return "You won!"

    return "You lost!"

def is_win(player, opponent):
    if (player == "rock" and opponent == "scissors") or (player == "scissors" and opponent == "paper") or (player == "paper" and opponent == "rock"):
        return True

    return False

print(game())
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose rock, computer chose rock.

It's a tie!
```
