## Exercise
Create a function that uses the reduce function to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list. Use the function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].

## Reference Solution
```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all numbers in a list using the reduce function.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers in the list.
    """
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum_numbers(numbers)
print(f"The sum of the numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum(numbers)
print(f"The sum of the numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the numbers in the list is: 10
```
