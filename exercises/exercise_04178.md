    {"name": "Alex", "position": "Small Forward"},
    {"name": "Sam", "position": "Power Forward"},
    {"name": "Jack", "position": "Center"}
]

# Define a function to print the team roster
def print_team_roster(roster):
    print("\nTeam Roster:")
    for player in roster:
        print(f"{player['name']}: {player['position']}")

# Print the team roster
print_team_roster(team_roster)
