## Exercise
Write a function that generates a random number between 1 and 100, then repeatedly asks the user for a guess until they correctly guess the number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    """
    Generates a random number between 1 and 100, then repeatedly asks the user for a guess until they correctly guess the number.
    """
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
        
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, the number was {}. Thanks for playing!".format(number_to_guess))
            break
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
            print("Please guess a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.".format(attempts))
            break

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
