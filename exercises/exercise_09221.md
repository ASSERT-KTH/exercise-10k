## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should consist of a series of rows where each row contains a sequence of numbers from 1 to the row number. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should be: 1, 2 1, 3 2 1, 4 3 2 1, 5 4 3 2 1

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Description: Prints a pattern of numbers using loops
# Date: [Today's Date]

# Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops
# The pattern should consist of a series of rows where each row contains a sequence of numbers from 1 to the row number

# Example pattern for input 5:
# 1
# 2 1
# 3 2 1
# 4 3 2 1
# 5 4 3 2 1

# Initialize a counter variable
cnt = 1

# Loop until cnt is greater than 5
while cnt <= 5:
    # Inner loop to print the pattern
    i = cnt
    while i > 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
        i -= 1
    # Print a newline character
    print()
    # Increment the counter variable
    cnt += 1
```

## Generated Output
```
1 
2 1 
3 2 1 
4 3 2 1 
5 4 3 2 1
```
