## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Importing the necessary modules
import sys

# Defining the main function
def main():
    # Getting the user input
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

    # Performing the calculations
    if operation == "+":
        print(a, "+", b, "=", a + b)
    elif operation == "-":
        print(a, "-", b, "=", a - b)
    elif operation == "*":
        print(a, "*", b, "=", a * b)
    elif operation == "/":
        if b != 0:
            print(a, "/", b, "=", a / b)
        else:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
            sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Error: Invalid operation. Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /.") # Exit status 1 indicates an error
        sys.exit(1)

# Checking if the script is being run from the command line
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmps3nby_5d.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmps3nby_5d.py", line 7, in main
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 2 add'
```
