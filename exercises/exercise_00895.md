## Exercise
Create a program that allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of a bank account.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        """
        Initialize a bank account with an initial balance.

        Args:
            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposit money into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount cannot be negative")
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraw money from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the account balance.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount cannot be negative")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Get the current balance of the account.

        Returns:
            float: The current balance of the account.
        """
        return self.balance


def main():
    account = BankAccount()

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
                account.deposit(amount)
                print(f"Deposit successful. New balance: {account.check_balance()}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "2":
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
                account.withdraw(amount)
                print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {account.check_balance()}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"Current balance: {account.check_balance()}")
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
