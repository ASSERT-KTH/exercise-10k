## Exercise
Create a function that takes an array and a target element as input, and returns the number of times the target element appears in the array. The function should be case-insensitive if the array contains strings.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_target_element(array, target):
    """
    This function takes an array and a target element as input, 
    and returns the number of times the target element appears in the array.
    
    The function is case-insensitive if the array contains strings.

    Parameters:
    array (list): The input list to search for the target element.
    target: The target element to be searched in the array.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the target element appears in the array.
    """

    # Initialize a counter variable to store the count of the target element
    count = 0
    
    # Check if the array is not empty
    if array:
        
        # Iterate over each element in the array
        for element in array:
            
            # Check if the element is a string and the target is also a string
            if isinstance(element, str) and isinstance(target, str):
                
                # Compare the element and the target in a case-insensitive manner
                if element.casefold() == target.casefold():
                    
                    # If they match, increment the counter
                    count += 1
                    
            # If the element and the target are not strings, compare them directly
            elif element == target:
                
                # If they match, increment the counter
                count += 1
                
    # Return the count of the target element
    return count
