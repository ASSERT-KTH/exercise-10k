## Exercise
Write a program that demonstrates the importance of initializing variables before use, and shows what happens when variables are not initialized.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program demonstrates the importance of initializing variables before use

# Function to demonstrate what happens when variables are not initialized
def uninitialized_variable():
    try:
        print("Value of uninitialized variable: ", x)
    except NameError as e:
        print("Error:", e)

# Function to demonstrate what happens when variables are initialized
def initialized_variable():
    x = 10  # Initializing variable
    print("Value of initialized variable: ", x)

# Main function
def main():
    print("Demonstrating the importance of initializing variables before use:")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------")
    
    print("\nWhat happens when variables are not initialized:")
    uninitialized_variable()

    print("\nWhat happens when variables are initialized:")
    initialized_variable()

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Demonstrating the importance of initializing variables before use:
---------------------------------------------------------------

What happens when variables are not initialized:
Error: name 'x' is not defined

What happens when variables are initialized:
Value of initialized variable:  10
```
