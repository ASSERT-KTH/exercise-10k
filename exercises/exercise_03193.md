## Exercise
Create a program that takes a number as input and uses if/else statements to check if it's a large number (e.g., greater than 1000).

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_large_number(num):
    """
    Checks if a number is large (greater than 1000).

    Args:
        num (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the number is large or not.
    """
    if num > 1000:
        return f"{num} is a large number."
    else:
        return f"{num} is not a large number."

def main():
    # Get user input
    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Check if the number is large
    result = check_large_number(num)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 1500 is a large number.
```
