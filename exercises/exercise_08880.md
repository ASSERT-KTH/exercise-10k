## Exercise
Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    """
    Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.
    
    Parameters:
    base (float): The base of the triangle.
    height (float): The height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    if base < 0 or height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Base and height cannot be negative.")
    
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    return area


def main():
    # Example usage:
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
    
    try:
        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
        print(f"The area of the triangle is {area}.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base of the triangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkxajc5f_.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkxajc5f_.py", line 21, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '3 4'
```
