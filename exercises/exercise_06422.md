## Exercise
Create a game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. Use a while loop to keep asking for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
        
        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue
        
        # Check if the guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too low. Try again!")
        else:
            print("Your guess is too high. Try again!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Your guess is too low. Try again!
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
