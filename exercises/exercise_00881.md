## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. If the user's guess is higher than the number, print 'Too high'. If the guess is lower, print 'Too low'. If the guess is correct, print 'Congratulations!' and end the program.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")

        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:
            print("Please guess a number between 1 and 10.")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high")
        else:
            print("Congratulations!")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 10: Too low
Guess a number between 1 and 10:
