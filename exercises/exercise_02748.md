## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the pressure of a gas given its force and area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_pressure(force, area):
    """
    Calculate the pressure of a gas given its force and area.

    Args:
        force (float): The force applied to the gas.
        area (float): The area over which the force is applied.

    Returns:
        float: The pressure of the gas.
    """
    if area <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Area must be greater than zero.")
    pressure = force / area
    return pressure

def main():
    print("Pressure Calculator Program")
    print("----------------------------")

    # Get user input for force and area
    force = float(input("Enter the force (in Newtons): "))
    area = float(input("Enter the area (in square meters): "))

    try:
        # Calculate pressure
        pressure = calculate_pressure(force, area)

        # Print the result
        print(f"The pressure is {pressure} Pascals.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Pressure Calculator Program
----------------------------
Enter the force (in Newtons): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpaoubx1ln.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpaoubx1ln.py", line 22, in main
    force = float(input("Enter the force (in Newtons): "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 2'
