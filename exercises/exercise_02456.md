## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all possible combinations of elements from both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
from itertools import product

l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [4, 5, 6]

# Method 1: Using product function
result1 = [list(i) for i in product(l1, l2)]
print(result1)

# Method 2: Using nested loops
result2 = []
for i in l1:
    for j in l2:
        result2.append([i, j])
print(result2)
```

## Generated Output
```
[[1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]
[[1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]
```
