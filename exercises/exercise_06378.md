## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements from both lists, without duplicates

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    Merge two lists and return a new list with unique elements.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to merge.
        list2 (list): The second list to merge.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all unique elements from both input lists.
    """
    # Combine both lists into a set to remove duplicates
    merged_set = set(list1 + list2)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and return it
    return list(merged_set)

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

merged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)
print("Merged List:", merged_list)
```

```python
def merge_lists_ordered(list1, list2):
    """
    Merge two lists and return a new list with unique elements, preserving order.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to merge.
        list2 (list): The second list to merge.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all unique elements from both input lists, in the original order.
    """
    seen = set()
    merged_list = []
    
    for element in list1 + list2:
        if element not in seen:
            merged_list.append(element)
            seen.add(element)
    
    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

merged_list = merge_lists_ordered(list1, list2)
print("Merged List (Ordered):", merged_list)
```

## Generated Output
```
Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
