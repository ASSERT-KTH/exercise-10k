## Exercise
Declare a constant 'PI' with the value 3.14159 and use it to calculate the area of a circle.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a constant 'PI'
PI = 3.14159

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    area = PI * (radius ** 2)
    return area

# Example usage:
radius = 5.0
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)

print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The area of the circle with radius 5.0 is: 78.53975
```
