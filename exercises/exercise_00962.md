## Exercise
Given a dictionary and a key, write a function to retrieve the value associated with that key. If the key does not exist, return 'Key not found'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.
    
    If the key does not exist in the dictionary, returns 'Key not found'.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.
        key (any): The key to search for.

    Returns:
        any: The value associated with the key if found, 'Key not found' otherwise.
    """

    # First, we check if the dictionary is None to avoid an AttributeError
    if dictionary is None:
        return 'Dictionary is None'

    # Then, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    # We use the 'in' keyword to check for key existence, which is more efficient than trying to access the key and catching the KeyError
    if key in dictionary:
        # If the key exists, we return its associated value
        return dictionary[key]
    else:
        # If the key does not exist, we return 'Key not found'
        return 'Key not found'

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(get_value(my_dict, 'a'))  # Outputs: 1
print(get_value(my_dict, 'd'))  # Outputs: Key not found
```

## Generated Output
```
1
Key not found
```
