## Exercise
Create a program that determines the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The program should take two inputs, the choice of player 1 and player 2, and output the winner or a tie.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    
    # Validate player inputs
    if player1_choice.lower() not in choices or player2_choice.lower() not in choices:
        raise ValueError("Invalid choice. Choices must be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.")
        
    # Determine the winner
    if player1_choice.lower() == player2_choice.lower():
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player1_choice.lower() == "rock" and player2_choice.lower() == "scissors") or \
         (player1_choice.lower() == "scissors" and player2_choice.lower() == "paper") or \
         (player1_choice.lower() == "paper" and player2_choice.lower() == "rock"):
        return "Player 1 wins!"
    else:
        return "Player 2 wins!"

def main():
    player1_choice = input("Enter player 1's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
    player2_choice = input("Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
    print(determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter player 1's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9y4v7w56.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9y4v7w56.py", line 20, in main
    player2_choice = input("Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
