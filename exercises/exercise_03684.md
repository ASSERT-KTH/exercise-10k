## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the simple interest and compound interest based on principal amount, rate, and time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the simple interest.

    Args:
    principal (float): The principal amount.
    rate (float): The interest rate in percentage.
    time (int): The time in years.

    Returns:
    float: The simple interest.
    """
    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    return simple_interest

def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the compound interest.

    Args:
    principal (float): The principal amount.
    rate (float): The interest rate in percentage.
    time (int): The time in years.

    Returns:
    float: The compound interest.
    """
    compound_interest = principal * ((1 + (rate / 100)) ** time) - principal
    return compound_interest

def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate in percentage: "))
    time = int(input("Enter the time in years: "))

    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)
    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)

    print(f"Simple Interest: {simple_interest:.2f}")
    print(f"Compound Interest: {compound_interest:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp7qkh_uix.py", line 43, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp7qkh_uix.py", line 32, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'principal = 1000, rate = 5, time = 2'
```
