## Exercise
Write a function that takes an array and a predicate as input and returns two arrays: one containing the elements that satisfy the predicate and one containing the elements that do not satisfy the predicate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition(array, predicate):
    """
    This function takes an array and a predicate as input, 
    and returns two arrays: one containing the elements that satisfy the predicate 
    and one containing the elements that do not satisfy the predicate.

    Args:
        array (list): The input list of elements.
        predicate (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple of two lists. The first list contains the elements that satisfy the predicate, 
        and the second list contains the elements that do not satisfy the predicate.
    """

    # Initialize two empty lists to store the elements that satisfy and do not satisfy the predicate
    satisfied = []
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the elements that do not satisfy the predicate
    not_satisfied = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input array
    for element in array:
        # Check if the current element satisfies the predicate
        if predicate(element):
            # If the element satisfies the predicate, add it to the satisfied list
            satisfied.append(element)
        else:
            # If the element does not satisfy the predicate, add it to the not_satisfied list
            not_satisfied.append(element)

    # Return a tuple containing the satisfied and not_satisfied lists
    return satisfied, not_satisfied

# Example usage:
# Define a predicate function that checks if a number is even
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Test the partition function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition(numbers, is_even)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5]
```
