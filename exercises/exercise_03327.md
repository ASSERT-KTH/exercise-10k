## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for n in numbers:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(n)
    return even_numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
