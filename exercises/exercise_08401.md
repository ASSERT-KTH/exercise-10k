## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their average grades.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Check if the student has any grades
        if len(grades) > 0:
            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student
            total_grade = sum(grades)
            
            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of grades
            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)
            
            # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
            average_grades[student] = average_grade
        else:
            # If the student has no grades, store a grade of 0 in the average_grades dictionary
            average_grades[student] = 0

    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades for each student
    return average_grades

# Example usage:
grades = {
    "Alice": [90, 85, 95],
    "Bob": [80, 75, 85],
    "Charlie": []
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades)
print(average_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'Alice': 90.0, 'Bob': 80.0, 'Charlie': 0}
```
