## Exercise
Write a program that generates an arithmetic sequence of a given length with a given common difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, length):
    """
    Generate an arithmetic sequence of a given length with a given common difference.

    Args:
        first_term (float): The first term of the sequence.
        common_difference (float): The common difference between terms.
        length (int): The length of the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: The generated arithmetic sequence.
    """
    sequence = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(length)]
    return sequence

def main():
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
    common_difference = float(input("Enter the common difference: "))
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: "))

    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, length)
    print("Arithmetic Sequence:")
    print(sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first term: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp64dvwdc1.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp64dvwdc1.py", line 17, in main
    first_term = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 2'
```
