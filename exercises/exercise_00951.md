## Exercise
Write a program that prints powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10 using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_powers_of_2():
    """
    Prints powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10
    """
    for i in range(11):  # loop from 0 to 10
        power_of_2 = 2 ** i
        print(f"2^{i} = {power_of_2}")

print_powers_of_2()
```

## Generated Output
```
2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
2^5 = 32
2^6 = 64
2^7 = 128
2^8 = 256
2^9 = 512
2^10 = 1024
```
