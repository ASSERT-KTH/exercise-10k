## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the union of two lists of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def union_of_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the union of two lists of numbers.

    Args:

        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing all unique elements from both input lists.
    """
    return list(set(list1 + list2))

def main():
    # Example usage
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

    union_list = union_of_lists(list1, list2)
    print("Union of the lists:", union_list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
