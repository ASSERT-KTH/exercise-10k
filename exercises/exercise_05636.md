## Exercise
Create a program to find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s, t):
    """
    Find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The string to search for the minimum window substring.
        t (str): The string containing all characters that must be present in the minimum window substring.

    Returns:
        str: The minimum window substring that contains all characters of the given string.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a counter for the characters in string t
    t_count = Counter(t)

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum window substring
    min_window = ""
    min_window_length = float('inf')

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the current window substring
    left = 0
    formed = 0

    # Create a counter for the characters in the current window substring
    window_counts = {}

    # Iterate over the string s
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add the character at the right pointer to the window counter
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        # If the character is in t and its count in the window is equal to its count in t, increment the formed counter
        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed += 1

        # While the window contains all characters of t and the left pointer is not at the beginning of the window
        while left <= right and formed == len(t_count):
            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_window_length:
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]
                min_window_length = right - left + 1

            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counter
            character = s[left]
            window_counts[character] -= 1

            # If the character is in t and its count in the window is less than its count in t, decrement the formed counter
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed -= 1

            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1

    return min_window

# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
