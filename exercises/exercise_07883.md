## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through an array of integers and print the sum of all the elements. Then, use a while loop to find the maximum element in the array and print it.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Define the array of integers
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Use for loop to calculate sum
    sum_of_elements = 0
    for num in array:
        sum_of_elements += num

    print("Sum of all elements:", sum_of_elements)

    # Use while loop to find maximum element
    max_element = array[0]
    i = 1
    while i < len(array):
        if array[i] > max_element:
            max_element = array[i]
        i += 1

    print("Maximum element:", max_element)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of all elements: 55
Maximum element: 10
```
