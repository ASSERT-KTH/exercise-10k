## Exercise
Write a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, with the computer determining the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_player_choice(player_name):
    """Get player's choice"""
    while True:
        choice = input(f"{player_name}, enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").strip().capitalize()
        if choice in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            return choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):
    """Determine the winner"""
    if player1_choice == player2_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (player1_choice == "Rock" and player2_choice == "Scissors") or \
       (player1_choice == "Scissors" and player2_choice == "Paper") or \
       (player1_choice == "Paper" and player2_choice == "Rock"):
        return "Player 1 wins!"
    return "Player 2 wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play the game"""
    player1_name = input("Enter Player 1's name: ")
    player2_name = input("Enter Player 2's name: ")
    
    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name)
    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name)
    
    print(f"\n{player1_name} chose: {player1_choice}")
    print(f"{player2_name} chose: {player2_choice}\n")
    
    result = determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice)
    print(result)

def main():
    play_game()
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
    while play_again == "yes":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter Player 1's name: Enter Player 2's name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpvpn_ff5_.py", line 43, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpvpn_ff5_.py", line 36, in main
    play_game()
  File "/tmp/tmpvpn_ff5_.py", line 24, in play_game
    player2_name = input("Enter Player 2's name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
