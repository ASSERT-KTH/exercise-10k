## Exercise
Given two strings, find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of the second string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search in.
    t (str): The string to search for.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in `t`.
    t_freq = defaultdict(int)
    for char in t:
        t_freq[char] += 1

    # Initialize the `left` and `right` pointers.
    left = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    min_window = ""

    # Initialize the count of characters in `t` that we have found.
    count = 0

    # Iterate over `s` using the `right` pointer.
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Decrement the frequency of the current character in `t`.
        if s[right] in t_freq:
            t_freq[s[right]] -= 1
            # If the frequency becomes 0, it means we have found a character in `t`.
            if t_freq[s[right]] == 0:
                count += 1

        # If we have found all characters in `t`, update the minimum window substring.
        while count == len(t_freq):
            # Update the minimum window substring.
            if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                min_len = right - left + 1
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]

            # Move the `left` pointer to the right until we no longer have all characters in `t`.
            if s[left] in t_freq:
                t_freq[s[left]] += 1
                # If the frequency becomes 1, it means we no longer have a character in `t`.
                if t_freq[s[left]] > 0:
                    count -= 1
            left += 1

    return min_window

# Example usage:
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
