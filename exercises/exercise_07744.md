## Exercise
Write a program that uses loops to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, where each row contains a sequence of numbers from 1 to the row number. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2 1 2, 3 1 2 3, 4 1 2 3 4, 5 1 2 3 4 5. Use a for loop to iterate over the rows and a while loop to print the numbers in each row.

## Reference Solution
```python
package com.example.pattern;

public class Pattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
            int k = 1;
            while (k <= j) {
                System.out.print(k + " ");
                k++;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
