## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the natural logarithm of a given number using the Taylor series expansion.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_ln_taylor(x, n):
    """
    Calculate the natural logarithm of a given number using the Taylor series expansion.

    Args:
        x (float): The input number.
        n (int): The number of terms to consider in the Taylor series expansion.

    Returns:
        float: The approximate natural logarithm of x.
    """
    # Check if x is within the valid range
    if x <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive number.")

    # Initialize the sum
    ln_x = 0

    # Calculate the Taylor series expansion
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the sign of the current term
        sign = (-1) ** (i + 1)

        # Calculate the current term
        term = (x - 1) ** i / i

        # Add the current term to the sum
        ln_x += sign * term

    return ln_x

# Example usage
x = 2
n = 100  # Number of terms to consider
ln_x = calculate_ln_taylor(x, n)

print(f"The natural logarithm of {x} using Taylor series expansion is approximately {ln_x:.6f}")
print(f"The actual natural logarithm of {x} is {math.log(x):.6f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The natural logarithm of 2 using Taylor series expansion is approximately 0.688172
The actual natural logarithm of 2 is 0.693147
```
