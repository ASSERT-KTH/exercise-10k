## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate grade
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

# Main function
def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if 0 <= score <= 100:
        # Calculate the grade
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")
    else:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
