    return name, age, email

def print_greeting(name, age, email):
    """Prints out a greeting message with the user's name, age, and email address."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and your email address is {email}.")

def main():
    name, age, email = get_user_info()
    print_greeting(name, age, email)

if __name__ == "__main__":
