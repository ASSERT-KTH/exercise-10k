## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the substring in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def last_occurrence(string, substring):
    """
    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the last occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    """

    # Check if the substring is empty, in which case we return -1
    if not substring:
        return -1

    # We use the rfind method of the string class, which returns the highest index of the substring if it is found
    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1
    last_index = string.rfind(substring)

    # We return the last index
    return last_index
```
