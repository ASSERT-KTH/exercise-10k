## Exercise
Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function should have a docstring that describes its purpose and usage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    """
    Prints a greeting message to the console.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:
        >>> greet("John")
        Hello, John!
    """

    # First, we want to start the greeting message with 'Hello, '
    greeting_message = "Hello, "

    # Then, we append the name to the greeting message
    # We use the str.format() method to insert the name into the string
    greeting_message += "{}!".format(name)

    # Finally, we print the greeting message to the console
    print(greeting_message)

# Test the function
greet("John")
```
