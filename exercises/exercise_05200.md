## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for the score of a game and then prints out the score in the format 'team_name score' (e.g. 'Team A 10').

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_score_from_user():
    """
    Asks the user for the team name and score, then returns them.
    """
    team_name = input("Please enter the team name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            score = int(input("Please enter the score: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Score must be an integer.")
    return team_name, score

def print_score(team_name, score):
    """
    Prints the score in the format 'team_name score'.
    """
    print(f"{team_name} {score}")

def main():
    team_name, score = get_score_from_user()
    print_score(team_name, score)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the team name: Please enter the score: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
