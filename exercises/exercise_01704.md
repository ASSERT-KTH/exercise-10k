## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to let the user guess a secret number until they guess correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def main():
    # Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of guesses
    num_guesses = 0

    print("Welcome to the secret number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, the secret number was {}.".format(secret_number))
            break

        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Increment the number of guesses
        num_guesses += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif user_guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {} guesses.".format(num_guesses))
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the secret number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too high!
Take a guess: Too low!
Take a guess: Too high!
Take a guess: Too high!
