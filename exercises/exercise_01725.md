## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers):
    """
    Removes duplicates from a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.
    """
    return list(set(numbers))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
    unique_numbers = remove_duplicates(numbers)
    print("Original List:", numbers)
    print("List without Duplicates:", unique_numbers)
```

```python
def remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers):
    """
    Removes duplicates from a list of numbers while preserving order.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.
    """
    seen = set()
    unique_numbers = [x for x in numbers if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]
    return unique_numbers

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
    unique_numbers = remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers)
    print("Original List:", numbers)
    print("List without Duplicates:", unique_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
List without Duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
