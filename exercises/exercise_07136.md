## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. The program should take an integer grade as input and print 'Pass' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Fail' otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the main function
def main():
    # Prompt the user for their grade
    grade = int(input("Enter your grade: "))

    # Check if the grade is 50 or above
    if grade >= 50:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your grade: Pass
```
