## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input, divides the first number by the second,
    and returns the quotient and remainder.
    
    Parameters:
    dividend (int): The number being divided.
    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder of the division.
    """
    
    # Check if the divisor is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    
    # Calculate the quotient and remainder using the built-in divmod function
    quotient, remainder = divmod(dividend, divisor)
    
    return quotient, remainder


def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
    
    # Call the function to get the quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
    
    # Print the results
    print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpvn6f2cnk.py", line 37, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpvn6f2cnk.py", line 26, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
```
