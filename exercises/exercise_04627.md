## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and a rotation amount as input, and returns the rotated array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(arr, rotation_amount):
    """
    Rotate the input array by the specified amount.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to be rotated.
        rotation_amount (int): The amount of rotation. Can be positive or negative.

    Returns:
        list: The rotated array.
    """
    rotation_amount = rotation_amount % len(arr)  # Handle cases where rotation_amount is greater than len(arr)
    return arr[-rotation_amount:] + arr[:-rotation_amount]

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rotation_amount = 2
rotated_arr = rotate_array(arr, rotation_amount)
print(rotated_arr)  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
