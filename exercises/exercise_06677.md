## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the volume of a sphere

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_sphere_volume(radius):
    """
    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.

    Returns:
        float: The volume of the sphere.
    """
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    return volume

def main():
    # Example usage
    radius = 5.0  # in units (e.g., meters, inches)
    volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)
    print(f"The volume of the sphere with radius {radius} is {volume:.2f} cubic units.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The volume of the sphere with radius 5.0 is 523.60 cubic units.
```
