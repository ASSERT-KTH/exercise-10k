## Exercise
Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively. Then print their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.
x = 10
y = 20

# Print their sum.
print("The sum of x and y is: ", x + y)
```

```python
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;

        // Print their sum.
        System.out.println("The sum of x and y is: " + (x + y));
    }
}
```

```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    // Print their sum.
    std::cout << "The sum of x and y is: " << (x + y) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of x and y is:  30
```
