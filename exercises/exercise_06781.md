## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array and a number of positions as input, and rotates the array to the right by that number of positions. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number of positions is 2, the output should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(arr, num_positions):
    """
    Rotate an array to the right by a specified number of positions.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to be rotated.
        num_positions (int): The number of positions to rotate the array.

    Returns:
        list: The rotated array.
    """
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not arr:
        return arr

    # Calculate the actual number of positions to rotate, in case num_positions is larger than the array length
    num_positions = num_positions % len(arr)

    # Split the array into two parts: the last 'num_positions' elements and the rest
    last_part = arr[-num_positions:]
    first_part = arr[:-num_positions]

    # Combine the two parts in reverse order to get the rotated array
    rotated_arr = last_part + first_part

    return rotated_arr

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
num_positions = 2

rotated_arr = rotate_array(arr, num_positions)
print(rotated_arr)  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
