## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

    Args:
    n (int): The maximum number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
    list: The Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
    """
    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    # Initialize the sequence with the first two terms
    sequence = [a, b]
    # Initialize a counter for the number of terms
    i = 2

    # Continue generating terms while the counter is less than n
    while i < n:
        # Calculate the next term as the sum of the previous two terms
        next_term = a + b
        # Append the next term to the sequence
        sequence.append(next_term)
        # Update the previous two terms for the next iteration
        a, b = b, next_term
        # Increment the counter
        i += 1

    return sequence

# Test the function
n = 10  # Change this to generate a different number of terms
print(f"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
