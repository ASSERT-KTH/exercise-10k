## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_sum():
    """
    Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 11):  # Loop through numbers from 1 to 10
        total_sum += i  # Add each number to the total sum
    return total_sum

def main():
    # Example usage
    result = calculate_sum()
    print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```
