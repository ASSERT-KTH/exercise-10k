        "B": "Paris",
        "C": "London",
        "D": "Rome",

        "C": "Jane Austen",
        "D": "J.K. Rowling",
        "answer": "B"
    }
}

def ask_questions(questions):
    """Ask the user a series of questions and keep track of their score."""
    score = 0
    for question, options in questions.items():
        print(question)
        for option, value in options.items():
            if option != "answer":
                print(f"{option}: {value}")
        answer = input("Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): ")
        if answer.upper() == options["answer"]:
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {options['answer']}.\n")
    return score

def main():
    """Main function."""
    print("Welcome to the quiz program!")
    score = ask_questions(questions)
    print(f"Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
