## Exercise
Write a program that takes the price of an item and the sales tax rate as input and returns the total cost.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculates the total cost of an item based on its price and sales tax rate.

    Args:
    - price (float): The price of the item.
    - tax_rate (float): The sales tax rate as a decimal.

    Returns:
    - float: The total cost of the item.
    """
    tax_amount = price * tax_rate
    total_cost = price + tax_amount
    return total_cost

def main():
    # Get user input
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the sales tax rate (in %): "))

    # Convert tax rate from percentage to decimal
    tax_rate = tax_rate / 100

    # Calculate total cost
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate)

    # Print result
    print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the price of the item: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpwj9psioz.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpwj9psioz.py", line 18, in main
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: $"))
