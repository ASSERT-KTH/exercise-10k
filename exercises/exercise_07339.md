## Exercise
Write a program that takes input from the user and writes it to a network socket.

## Reference Solution
```python
import socket

def main():
    # Create a socket object
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server address and port
    server_address = ('localhost', 12345)

    try:
        # Connect to the server
        print('Connecting to {} port {}'.format(*server_address))
        client_socket.connect(server_address)

        while True:
            # Get user input
            user_input = input('Enter a message: ')

            # Send user input to the server
            client_socket.sendall(user_input.encode())

            # Close the connection if the user types 'quit'
            if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
                break

    finally:
        # Close the socket
        print('Closing socket')
        client_socket.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

```python
import socket

def main():
    # Create a socket object
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server address and port
    server_address = ('localhost', 12345)

    try:
        # Bind the socket to the address and port
        print('Starting up on {} port {}'.format(*server_address))
        server_socket.bind(server_address)

        # Listen for incoming connections
        server_socket.listen(1)

        print('Waiting for a connection...')
        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()

        try:
            print('Connection from', client_address)

            # Receive data in small chunks and retransmit it
            while True:
                data = connection.recv(16)
                print('Received {!r}'.format(data))

                if data:
                    print('Sending data back to the client')
                    connection.sendall(data)
                else:
                    print('No more data from', client_address)
                    break

        finally:
            # Close the connection
            connection.close()

    finally:
        # Close the socket
        server_socket.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Connecting to localhost port 12345
Closing socket
