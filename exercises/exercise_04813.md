## Exercise
Given an array of integers where each element appears twice except for one, find the single number. The function should take in an array of integers as input and return the single number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    res = 0
    for num in nums:
        res ^= num
    return res

# Test cases
print(singleNumber([2, 2, 1]))  # Expected output: 1
print(singleNumber([4, 1, 2, 1, 2]))  # Expected output: 4
print(singleNumber([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
1
4
3
```
