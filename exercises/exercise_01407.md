## Exercise
Write a program that counts down from a given time in seconds. If the time is above 60, print the minutes and seconds, otherwise print only the seconds.

## Reference Solution
```python
import time

def countdown(t):
    while t:
        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)
        if mins > 0:
            print(f"{mins:02d}:{secs:02d}", end="\r")
        else:
            print(secs, end="\r")
        time.sleep(1)
        t -= 1
    print("Time's up!")

# Input time in seconds
t = int(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))

# Start countdown
countdown(t)
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution timed out after 5 seconds.
