## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and two indices as input and returns the slice of the list between the two indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
def slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):
    """
    This function takes a list and two indices as input and returns the slice of the list between the two indices.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list to be sliced.
        start_index (int): The starting index of the slice.
        end_index (int): The ending index of the slice.

    Returns:
        list: A slice of the input list between the start_index and end_index.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(input_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")

    # Then, we need to check if the start and end indices are integers. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):
        raise TypeError("Start and end indices must be integers.")

    # Next, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index. If not, we raise a ValueError.
    if start_index > end_index:
        raise ValueError("Start index must be less than or equal to the end index.")

    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to get the slice of the list between the two indices.
    # We use the start_index and end_index to slice the list. The end index is exclusive in Python's list slicing.
    # So, we don't need to add 1 to the end index to include the element at the end index in the slice.
    slice_of_list = input_list[start_index:end_index]

    # Finally, we return the slice of the list.
    return slice_of_list
```
