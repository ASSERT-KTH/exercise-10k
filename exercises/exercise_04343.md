## Exercise
Write a program that checks a student's grade and prints 'Pass' if the grade is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise prints 'Fail'

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade(grade):
    """
    Checks a student's grade and prints 'Pass' if the grade is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise prints 'Fail'.

    Args:
        grade (float): The student's grade.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Check if the grade is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
        print("Invalid grade. Grade should be between 0 and 100.")
    # Check if the grade is greater than or equal to 50
    elif grade >= 50:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")


# Example usage:
def main():
    grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade: "))
    check_grade(grade)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
