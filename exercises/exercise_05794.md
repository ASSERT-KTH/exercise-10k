## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

    Args:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        # Swap a and b, and replace b with the remainder of a divided by b
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Example usage:
def main():
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    print(f"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {calculate_gcd(num1, num2)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
GCD of 48 and 18: 6
```
