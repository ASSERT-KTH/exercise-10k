## Exercise
Create a program that takes a string input from the user, checks if it's a valid email address, and then outputs a greeting message with the user's name extracted from the email address. The email address is considered valid if it contains '@' and '.'. You should use basic string manipulation to extract the name and format the output.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def main():
    email = input("Enter your email address: ")
    if '@' in email and '.' in email:
        name = re.sub(r'@.*', '', email)
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    else:
        print("Invalid email address.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your email address: Hello, john.doe!
```
