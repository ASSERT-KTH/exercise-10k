## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the total cost of a meal after applying a tip percentage.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of a meal after applying a tip percentage.

    Args:
        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.
        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost of the meal.
    """
    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)
    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount
    return total_cost

def main():
    # Get the meal cost and tip percentage from the user
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
    tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (%): "))

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)

    # Print the result
    print(f"Meal Cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Tip Percentage: {tip_percentage}%")
    print(f"Tip Amount: ${meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100):.2f}")
    print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the cost of the meal: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
