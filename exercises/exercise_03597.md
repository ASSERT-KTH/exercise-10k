## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the change given the amount paid and the total bill.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_change(total_bill, amount_paid):
    """
    Calculate the change given the total bill and the amount paid.

    Args:
        total_bill (float): The total bill amount.
        amount_paid (float): The amount paid by the customer.

    Returns:
        float: The change amount.
    """
    if amount_paid < total_bill:
        raise ValueError("Amount paid cannot be less than the total bill")
    change = amount_paid - total_bill
    return change

def main():
    # Get the total bill and amount paid from the user
    total_bill = float(input("Enter the total bill: $"))
    amount_paid = float(input("Enter the amount paid: $"))

    # Calculate the change
    try:
        change = calculate_change(total_bill, amount_paid)
        print(f"Change: ${change:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total bill: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpb66a2jvl.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpb66a2jvl.py", line 19, in main
    total_bill = float(input("Enter the total bill: $"))
