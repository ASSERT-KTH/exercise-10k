## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    This function performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.
        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.
    """
    if operation == 'addition':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation. Supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.")


def main():
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ")
    
    try:
        result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)
        print(f"The result of {operation} is {result}.")
    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpac67gzfz.py", line 44, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpac67gzfz.py", line 32, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3 +'
```
