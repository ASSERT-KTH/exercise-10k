## Exercise
Write a program to find the transpose of a given matrix.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose(matrix):
    """
    Calculate the transpose of a given matrix.

    Args:
        matrix (list of lists): The input matrix.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The transposed matrix.
    """
    return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))

def print_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Print a matrix in a readable format.

    Args:
        matrix (list of lists): The matrix to print.
    """
    for row in matrix:
        print(row)

def main():
    # Example usage
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    print("Original Matrix:")
    print_matrix(matrix)

    transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)

    print("\nTransposed Matrix:")
    print_matrix(transposed_matrix)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original Matrix:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Transposed Matrix:
[1, 4, 7]
[2, 5, 8]
[3, 6, 9]
```
