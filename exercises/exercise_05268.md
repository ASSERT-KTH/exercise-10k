## Exercise
Develop a program to calculate the discount amount based on the price and discount percentage using conditional statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discount amount based on the price and discount percentage.

    Args:
        price (float): The original price of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The discount amount.
    """
    if discount_percentage < 0 or discount_percentage > 100:
        print("Invalid discount percentage. Please enter a value between 0 and 100.")
        return None
    else:
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100)
        return discount_amount

def main():
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

    discount_amount = calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage)

    if discount_amount is not None:
        print(f"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
        print(f"Price after discount: ${price - discount_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the price of the item: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5gkfh_zo.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp5gkfh_zo.py", line 20, in main
    price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 10'
```
