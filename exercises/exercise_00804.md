## Exercise
Use a boolean variable to control the flow of a program and print a message based on its value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_message(boolean_variable):
    """
    Prints a message based on the value of the boolean variable.

    Args:
        boolean_variable (bool): The boolean variable that controls the message.
    """
    if boolean_variable:
        print("The boolean variable is True.")
    else:
        print("The boolean variable is False.")

def main():
    # Set the boolean variable to True
    boolean_variable = True
    print_message(boolean_variable)

    # Set the boolean variable to False
    boolean_variable = False
    print_message(boolean_variable)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output

The boolean variable is True.
