## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user to guess which statement is false.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the random library to shuffle the statements
import random

# Define the statements and their corresponding boolean values
statements = [
    {"statement": "A cat has 4 legs.", "is_true": True},
    {"statement": "A dog has 4 legs.", "is_true": True},
    {"statement": "A bird has 2 legs.", "is_true": True},
    {"statement": "A snake has 4 legs.", "is_true": False}
]

# Shuffle the statements to randomize their order
random.shuffle(statements)

# Print the statements
for i, statement in enumerate(statements):
    print(f"{i+1}. {statement['statement']}")

# Ask the user to guess which statement is false
while True:
    guess = input("Which statement do you think is false? (Enter the number of the statement): ")
    if guess.isdigit() and 1 <= int(guess) <= len(statements):
        guess = int(guess)
        if not statements[guess - 1]["is_true"]:
            print("Congratulations! You are correct. The statement about the snake having 4 legs is false.")
            break
        else:
            print("Sorry, that's incorrect. Try again.")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and", len(statements))
```

## Generated Output
```
1. A dog has 4 legs.
2. A snake has 4 legs.
3. A cat has 4 legs.
4. A bird has 2 legs.
Which statement do you think is false? (Enter the number of the statement): Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 4
Which statement do you think is false? (Enter the number of the statement): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbwjnelcv.py", line 21, in <module>
    guess = input("Which statement do you think is false? (Enter the number of the statement): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
