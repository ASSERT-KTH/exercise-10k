## Exercise
Create a program that counts the frequency of each character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_character_frequency(input_string):
    """
    This function counts the frequency of each character in a given string.
    
    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string to count character frequencies from.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    frequency_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if char in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[char] += 1
        # If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[char] = 1
    
    return frequency_dict

def main():
    # Test the function with a string
    input_string = "Hello, World!"
    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)
    
    print("Character Frequency Count:")
    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():
        print(f"{char}: {frequency}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Character Frequency Count:
H: 1
e: 1
l: 3
o: 2
,: 1
 : 1
W: 1
r: 1
d: 1
!: 1
```
