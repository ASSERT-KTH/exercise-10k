## Exercise
Create a program that demonstrates the use of a looping statement with if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Loop through the list of numbers
for num in numbers:
    # Check if the number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    # If the number is not even, it must be odd
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")
```

## Generated Output
```
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
