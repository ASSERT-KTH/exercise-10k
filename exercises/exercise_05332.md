## Exercise
Declare two integer variables with the values 10 and 20. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations and print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare two integer variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

# Perform addition
addition_result = num1 + num2
print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}")

# Perform subtraction
subtraction_result = num1 - num2
print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}")

# Perform multiplication
multiplication_result = num1 * num2
print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}")

# Perform division
if num2 != 0:
    division_result = num1 / num2
    print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}")
else:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 10 + 20 = 30
Subtraction: 10 - 20 = -10
Multiplication: 10 * 20 = 200
Division: 10 / 20 = 0.5
```
