## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. If the guess is correct, print 'You win!'. If the guess is too high, print 'Too high!'. If the guess is too low, print 'Too low!'.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    target_number = random.randint(1, 10)

    # Ask the user for their guess
    while True:
        try:
            user_guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
            if 1 <= user_guess <= 10:
                break
            else:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 10.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Check the user's guess and provide feedback
    if user_guess == target_number:
        print("You win!")
    elif user_guess > target_number:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Too low!")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 10: Too low!
```
