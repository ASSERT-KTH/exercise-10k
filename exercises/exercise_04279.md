## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary and a key as input and returns True if the key is not present in the dictionary and False otherwise using the not in operator

## Reference Solution
```python
def key_not_in_dict(dictionary, key):
    """
    Checks if a key is not present in a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to check.
        key: The key to look for.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the key is not present in the dictionary, False otherwise.
    """
    return key not in dictionary

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(key_not_in_dict(my_dict, "d"))  # Output: True
print(key_not_in_dict(my_dict, "a"))  # Output: False
```
