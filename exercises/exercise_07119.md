## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), and score < 60 (F).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the function get_grade that takes a score as input
def get_grade(score):
    # Use if-elif-else statements to determine the grade
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Define the main function
def main():
    # Prompt the user to enter their score
    score = input("Please enter your score: ")
    
    # Call the get_grade function with the user's score
    grade = get_grade(int(score))
    
    # Print the grade to the console
    print("Your grade is:", grade)

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
