## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the list, and then returns the first and last elements of the reversed list. If the list has less than two elements, return the entire list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_and_get_elements(lst):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers, reverses it, and returns the first and last elements.
    If the list has less than two elements, it returns the entire list.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first and last elements of the reversed list, or the entire list if it has less than two elements.
    """

    # First, we check if the list has less than two elements
    if len(lst) < 2:
        # If the list has less than two elements, we return the entire list
        return lst
    
    # If the list has two or more elements, we reverse the list
    # We use slicing to create a new list that is the reverse of the original list
    reversed_lst = lst[::-1]
    
    # Then, we get the first and last elements of the reversed list
    # The first element is at index 0, and the last element is at index -1
    first_element = reversed_lst[0]
    last_element = reversed_lst[-1]
    
    # Finally, we return a list containing the first and last elements
    return [first_element, last_element]

# Example usage:
print(reverse_and_get_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [5, 1]
print(reverse_and_get_elements([1]))  # Output: [1]
print(reverse_and_get_elements([]))  # Output: []
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 1]
[1]
[]
```
