## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that contains all unique elements from both input arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_unique_elements(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Return a new array containing all unique elements from both input arrays.

    :param arr1: The first input array.
    :param arr2: The second input array.
    :return: A new array with all unique elements from both input arrays.
    """
    # Combine both arrays into a single array
    combined = arr1 + arr2
    
    # Use a set to remove duplicates and convert back to a list
    unique_elements = list(set(combined))
    
    return unique_elements

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

result = combine_unique_elements(arr1, arr2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
