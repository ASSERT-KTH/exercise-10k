## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. You can use basic algorithms such as iterating through the list and comparing each number to find the maximum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def max_num(list):
    max_num = list[0]
    for num in list:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

numbers = [10, 50, 30, 20, 40]
max_number = max_num(numbers)
print(max_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
50
```
