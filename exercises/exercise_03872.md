# Define a dictionary with countries as keys and their continents as values
country_continents = {

    "Italy": "Europe",
    "Spain": "Europe",
    "China": "Asia",
    "Japan": "Asia",

    filtered_countries = {
        country: capital
        for country, capital in countries.items()
        if country_continents.get(country) == continent
    }
    return filtered_countries

# Filter the dictionary to include only countries in Europe
continent = "Europe"
filtered_countries = filter_countries_by_continent(countries, country_continents, continent)

# Print the filtered dictionary
