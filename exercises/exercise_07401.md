## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all vowels removed. The function should also be able to handle strings with both uppercase and lowercase letters. Additionally, it should be able to handle strings with numbers and special characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_vowels(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input, removes all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) 
    and returns the resulting string. It can handle strings with numbers and special characters.

    Parameters:
    input_string (str): The input string from which vowels are to be removed.

    Returns:
    str: The input string with all vowels removed.
    """

    # First, we define a string of all lowercase and uppercase vowels
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'

    # Then, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string
    # We check if the character is not a vowel using the 'not in' operator
    # If the character is not a vowel, we include it in our new list
    no_vowels = [char for char in input_string if char not in vowels]

    # Finally, we use the 'join' method to concatenate all characters in our list into a single string
    # We return this string as the result
    return ''.join(no_vowels)
```
