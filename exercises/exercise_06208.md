## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_list(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with squared elements.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the squared elements
    squared_list = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for num in input_list:
        # Calculate the square of the current element
        squared_num = num ** 2
        
        # Append the squared element to the result list
        squared_list.append(squared_num)

    # Return the list with squared elements
    return squared_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(square_list(numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
