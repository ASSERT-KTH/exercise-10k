## Exercise
Write a function that takes a callback function as an argument and executes it.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it
def execute_callback(callback):
    """
    This function takes another function as an argument and executes it.

    Args:
        callback (function): The function to be executed.

    Returns:
        result: The result of the executed function.
    """

    # Check if the provided argument is callable (i.e., it's a function)
    if callable(callback):
        # If the argument is callable, execute it and return the result
        return callback()
    else:
        # If the argument is not callable, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message
        raise TypeError("The provided argument is not a function.")

# Example usage:
def example_callback():
    # This is an example function that will be passed to the execute_callback function
    print("The callback function was executed.")
    return "Callback executed successfully."

# Execute the example_callback function using the execute_callback function
result = execute_callback(example_callback)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
The callback function was executed.
Callback executed successfully.
```
