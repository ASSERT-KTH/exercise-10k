## Exercise
Write a function that takes an array of integers and extracts the elements at the even indices. The function should return a new array containing these extracted elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def extract_even_indices(arr):
    """
    This function takes an array of integers and extracts the elements at the even indices.
    It returns a new array containing these extracted elements.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
    list: A new list containing the elements at the even indices of the input list.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted elements
    even_indices = []

    # Iterate over the input list with both index and value
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        
        # Check if the index is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            
            # If the index is even, append the value to the even_indices list
            even_indices.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of extracted elements
    return even_indices

# Test the function
print(extract_even_indices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 3, 5]
```
