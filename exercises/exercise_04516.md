## Exercise
Create a program that plays Blackjack against the user. The user can choose to hit or stand.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# Define a dictionary to map card ranks to their values
card_values = {
    '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10,
    'J': 10, 'Q': 10, 'K': 10, 'A': 11
}

# Define a function to deal a card
def deal_card():
    """Deals a random card from a deck."""
    ranks = list(card_values.keys())
    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
    return {'rank': random.choice(ranks), 'suit': random.choice(suits)}

# Define a function to calculate the total value of a hand
def calculate_hand_value(hand):
    """Calculates the total value of a hand."""
    total = sum([card_values[card['rank']] for card in hand])
    # Adjust for Aces
    for card in hand:
        if card['rank'] == 'A' and total > 21:
            total -= 10
    return total

# Define a function to play the game
def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Blackjack."""
    # Initialize the player's and dealer's hands
    player_hand = [deal_card(), deal_card()]
    dealer_hand = [deal_card(), deal_card()]

    # Display the initial hands
    print("Your hand:")
    for card in player_hand:
        print(f"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}")
    print(f"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}")
    print()
    print("Dealer's up card:")
    print(f"{dealer_hand[0]['rank']} of {dealer_hand[0]['suit']}")

    # Player's turn
    while True:
        action = input("Do you want to hit or stand? ")
        if action.lower() == 'hit':
            player_hand.append(deal_card())
            print("Your hand:")
            for card in player_hand:
                print(f"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}")
            print(f"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}")
            if calculate_hand_value(player_hand) > 21:
                print("You busted! Dealer wins.")
                return
        elif action.lower() == 'stand':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter 'hit' or 'stand'.")

    # Dealer's turn
    while calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) < 17:
        dealer_hand.append(deal_card())

    # Display the final hands
    print()
    print("Your hand:")
    for card in player_hand:
        print(f"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}")
    print(f"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}")
    print()
    print("Dealer's hand:")
    for card in dealer_hand:
        print(f"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}")
    print(f"Total: {calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand)}")

    # Determine the winner
    if calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) > 21:
        print("Dealer busted! You win.")
    elif calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) < calculate_hand_value(player_hand):
        print("Your total is higher. You win.")
    elif calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) > calculate_hand_value(player_hand):
        print("Dealer's total is higher. Dealer wins.")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

# Play the game
play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Your hand:
6 of Hearts
2 of Clubs
Total: 8

Dealer's up card:
6 of Hearts
Do you want to hit or stand? Your hand:
6 of Hearts
2 of Clubs
4 of Hearts
Total: 12
Do you want to hit or stand?
