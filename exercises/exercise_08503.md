## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and age. The program should handle invalid age input and ensure the age is a positive integer.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Description: A program that prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age.

def get_age():
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if age < 0:
                print("Age must be a positive integer.")
            else:
                return age
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid age input. Please enter a positive integer.")

def main():
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = get_age()
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
