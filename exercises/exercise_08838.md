## Exercise
Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, a person is eligible to vote if they are 18 years or older.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility():
    """
    Asks for a person's age and determines whether they are eligible to vote.
    """
    # Ask for the person's age
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")

    # Check if the input is a valid integer
    try:
        age = int(age)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
        return

    # Check if the person is eligible to vote
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Main function
def main():
    check_voting_eligibility()

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your age: You are not eligible to vote.
```
