## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial


def main():
    # Example usage
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {calculate_factorial(num)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
