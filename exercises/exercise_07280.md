## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course. The function should take in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course. The grades can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F', and the credits can be any positive integer. The GPA is calculated by multiplying the grade point for each course by its credit, summing these products, and then dividing by the total number of credits.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gpa(grades_and_credits):
    """
    Calculate the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course.

    Args:
        grades_and_credits (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course.
            The grades can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F', and the credits can be any positive integer.

    Returns:
        float: The GPA of the student.

    grade_points = {'A': 4, 'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'D': 1, 'F': 0}

    # Initialize variables to store the total grade points and the total credits
    total_grade_points = 0
    total_credits = 0

    # Iterate over each course in the list of grades and credits
    for grade, credit in grades_and_credits:
        # Check if the grade is valid
        if grade not in grade_points:
            raise ValueError("Invalid grade. Grade must be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.")

        total_grade_points += course_grade_points
        
        # Add the credit for the current course to the total credits
        total_credits += credit

    # Check if there are any credits
    if total_credits == 0:
        # If there are no credits, return 0 as the GPA
        return 0
    else:
        # Calculate the GPA by dividing the total grade points by the total credits
        gpa = total_grade_points / total_credits
        
        # Return the calculated GPA
        return gpa
