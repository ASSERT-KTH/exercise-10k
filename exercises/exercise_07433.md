## Exercise
Create a function that finds the index of a given element in an array. If the element is not found, return -1. The function should handle arrays with duplicate elements and elements that do not exist in the array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_index(array, target):
    """
    This function finds the index of a given element in an array.
    
    If the element is not found, it returns -1. The function can handle arrays with duplicate elements and elements that do not exist in the array.

    Parameters:
    array (list): The list of elements to search in.
    target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(array, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Try to find the index of the target element in the array
    try:
        # Use the index method of the list to find the index of the target element
        # This method raises a ValueError if the target element is not found
        index = array.index(target)
        
        # If the target element is found, return its index
        return index
    
    # If the target element is not found, the index method raises a ValueError
    except ValueError:
        # In this case, return -1 as specified in the problem statement
        return -1
```
