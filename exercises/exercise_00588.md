## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of numbers from 1 to n as input, with one number missing, and returns the missing number.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums) + 1
        sum_of_all = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
        sum_of_now = sum(nums)
        return sum_of_all - sum_of_now

# Test cases
solution = Solution()

# Test case 1
nums = [0, 1, 3]
print(solution.missingNumber(nums))  # Output: 2

# Test case 2
nums = [4, 0, 3, 1]
print(solution.missingNumber(nums))  # Output: 2
```

## Generated Output
