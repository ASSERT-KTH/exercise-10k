## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. If the reversed string is a palindrome, the program should output 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The program should also output the reversed string.

## Reference Solution
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys

def reverseAndCheck(input):
    reversed = input[::-1]
    if reversed == input:
        return "Yes", reversed
    else:
        return "No", reversed

input = input("Please enter a string: ")
result, reversed = reverseAndCheck(input)

print("Reversed String: ", reversed)
print("Is Palindrome: ", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a string: Reversed String:  madam
Is Palindrome:  Yes
```
