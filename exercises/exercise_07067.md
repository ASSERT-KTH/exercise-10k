## Exercise
Write a program that takes a username and password as input and checks whether the user is authenticated or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary to store usernames and passwords
# In a real-world application, this data would typically be stored in a database
users = {
    "john": "password123",
    "jane": "password456",
    "admin": "adminpassword"
}

def authenticate(username, password):
    """
    Check if the username and password are valid.

    Args:
        username (str): The username to check.
        password (str): The password to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the username and password are valid, False otherwise.
    """
    return username in users and users[username] == password

def main():
    # Get the username and password from the user
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    password = input("Enter your password: ")

    # Check if the user is authenticated
    if authenticate(username, password):
        print("Authentication successful!")
    else:
        print("Invalid username or password.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your username: Enter your password: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpad3s4pbh.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpad3s4pbh.py", line 25, in main
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
