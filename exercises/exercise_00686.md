## Exercise
Write a program to find the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        int: The remainder of the division operation.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return remainder

def main():
    # Example usage:
    dividend = 17
    divisor = 5
    remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)
    print(f"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The remainder of 17 divided by 5 is 2
```
