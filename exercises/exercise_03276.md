## Exercise
Create a program that uses nested for loops to print out Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_pascals_triangle(n):
    """
    Prints Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.
    
    :param n: The number of rows to print.
    """
    # Create a list to store each row of the triangle
    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]
    
    # Calculate each element of the triangle using the formula for Pascal's Triangle
    for i in range(2, n):
        for j in range(1, i):
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
    
    # Print each row of the triangle
    for row in triangle:
        print(' ' * (n - len(row)), end='')  # Print leading spaces for alignment
        for num in row:
            print(f'{num} ', end='')
        print()

# Print Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row
print_pascals_triangle(5)
```
