## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
    return total

# Test the function
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = sum_even_numbers(n)
print(f"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is 30
```
