## Exercise
Create an anonymous function to square a number and apply it to a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a lambda function (anonymous function) to square each number
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

# Print the result
print(squared_numbers)
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
