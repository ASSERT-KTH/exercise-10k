## Exercise
Develop a program that takes in the team's name and score, then prints out the score report. If the score is above 100, print 'High score!', otherwise print 'Good score' or 'Low score'

## Reference Solution
```python
def score_report(team_name, score):
    """
    Prints the score report for a given team.

    Args:
        team_name (str): The name of the team.
        score (int): The score of the team.
    """
    if score > 100:
        print(f"{team_name} scored {score}. High score!")
    elif score >= 50:
        print(f"{team_name} scored {score}. Good score")
    else:
        print(f"{team_name} scored {score}. Low score")

def main():
    team_name = input("Enter the team's name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            score = int(input("Enter the team's score: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.")
    score_report(team_name, score)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the team's name: Enter the team's score: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp16mrvsg7.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp16mrvsg7.py", line 20, in main
    score = int(input("Enter the team's score: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
