## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with 'Fizz' and multiples of 5 with 'Buzz', and multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This is a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with 'Fizz' and multiples of 5 with 'Buzz', and multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'.

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```
