## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input and prints out a greeting message with their name and age. The program should handle both integer and string inputs for the age.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys

def greeting(name, age):
    greeting = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old."
    return greeting

def main(argv):
    if len(argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python greeting.py <name> <age>")
        return

    name = argv[1]
    age = argv[2]

    try:
        age = int(age)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    greeting_message = greeting(name, age)
    print(greeting_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv)
```

## Generated Output
```
Usage: python greeting.py <name> <age>
```
