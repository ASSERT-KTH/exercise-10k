## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to find the maximum number in a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_number(numbers):
    """
    This function finds the maximum number in a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        max_number (int or float): The maximum number in the list.
    """
    # Initialize max_number with the first element of the list
    max_number = numbers[0]
    
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # If the current number is greater than max_number, update max_number
        if num > max_number:
            max_number = num
    
    return max_number

# Example usage:
numbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7]
max_num = find_max_number(numbers)
print("The maximum number in the list is:", max_num)
```

```python
def find_max_number(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None  # or raise an exception, depending on your requirements
    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

## Generated Output
```
The maximum number in the list is: 9
```
