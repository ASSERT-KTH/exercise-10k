## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints out all prime numbers up to that integer. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_primes(n):
    """
    Prints all prime numbers up to the given integer n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for printing prime numbers.
    """
    for num in range(2, n + 1):
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            print(num)

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    print_primes(num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter an integer: 2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
```
