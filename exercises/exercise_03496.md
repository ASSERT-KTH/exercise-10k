## Exercise
Create a program that takes the cost of a meal and the tip percentage as input and returns the total cost with the tip.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):
    """
    Calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip.

    Args:
        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.
        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost of the meal including the tip.
    """
    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)
    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount
    return total_cost

def main():
    # Get user input
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
    tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (%): "))

    # Calculate and display the total cost
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)
    print(f"The total cost of the meal with a {tip_percentage}% tip is: ${total_cost:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the cost of the meal: $
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp7vg6_ubt.py", line 18, in main
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
