## Exercise
Write a program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_numbers(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers)

print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)
```

```python
def bubble_sort(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:
                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]
    return numbers

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)

print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
