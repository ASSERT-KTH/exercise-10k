## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and sorts them in ascending order using a basic algorithm such as bubble sort or selection sort.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
    return items

def main():
    items = [6, 9, 3, 1]
    print("Original list:", items)
    sorted_items = bubble_sort(items)
    print("Sorted list:", sorted_items)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [6, 9, 3, 1]
Sorted list: [1, 3, 6, 9]
```
