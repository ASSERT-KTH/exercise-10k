## Exercise
Write a program that reads user input and writes it to a file instead of printing to the console

## Reference Solution
```python
def write_to_file(filename):
    """
    Reads user input and writes it to a file.
    
    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file to write to.
    """
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        while True:
            user_input = input("Enter a line of text (or 'quit' to stop): ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
                break
            file.write(user_input + '\n')

def main():
    filename = input("Enter the filename to write to: ")
    if not filename.endswith('.txt'):
        filename += '.txt'
    write_to_file(filename)
    print(f"Input written to {filename}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the filename to write to: Enter a line of text (or 'quit' to stop): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpfaeoxm17.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpfaeoxm17.py", line 19, in main
    write_to_file(filename)
  File "/tmp/tmpfaeoxm17.py", line 10, in write_to_file
    user_input = input("Enter a line of text (or 'quit' to stop): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
