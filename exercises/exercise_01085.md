## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the remainder of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        int: The remainder of the division.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return dividend % divisor

def main():
    # Get user input
    dividend = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    try:
        # Calculate and print the remainder
        remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)
        print("The remainder of {} divided by {} is {}".format(dividend, divisor, remainder))
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmprpauu6o7.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmprpauu6o7.py", line 18, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 3'
```
