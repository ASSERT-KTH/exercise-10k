## Exercise
Create a program that generates a number sequence using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(start, end, step):
    """
    Generates a number sequence from start to end with a specified step.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting value of the sequence.
        end (int): The ending value of the sequence.
        step (int): The increment step of the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers in the generated sequence.
    """
    sequence = []
    for i in range(start, end + 1, step):
        sequence.append(i)
    return sequence

def main():
    # Example usage
    start_value = 1
    end_value = 10
    step_value = 2

    sequence = generate_sequence(start_value, end_value, step_value)
    print(f"Generated sequence: {sequence}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Generated sequence: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
