## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to manage a bank account based on user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.account_name = account_name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposit of ${amount} successful. New balance is ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawal of ${amount} successful. New balance is ${self.balance}")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance is ${self.balance}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount("123456789", "John Doe", 1000)

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Management")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
