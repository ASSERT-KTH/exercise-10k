## Exercise
Write a program that implements a hangman game using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# List of words to guess from
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

def hangman():
    # Select a random word from the list
    word = random.choice(word_list)
    word_length = len(word)

    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores
    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length
    guessed_letters = []
    tries = 6

    print("Let's play Hangman!")
    print(display_hangman(tries))
    print(' '.join(guessed_word))

    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:
        guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

        if len(guess) != 1:
            print("Please guess one letter at a time.")
        elif guess in guessed_letters:
            print("You already guessed this letter.")
        elif guess not in word:
            print(f"Incorrect! {guess} is not in the word.")
            tries -= 1
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
        else:
            print(f"Good job! {guess} is in the word.")
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
            word_as_list = list(word)
            indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]
            for index in indices:
                guessed_word[index] = guess

        print(display_hangman(tries))
        print(' '.join(guessed_word))

    if '_' not in guessed_word:
        print("Congratulations, you guessed the word!")
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, you didn't guess the word. The word was {word}.")
