## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax amount based on the user's income. If the income is above 50000, tax is 20%, between 20000 and 50000 tax is 15%, and below 20000 tax is 10%.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount based on the user's income.

    Args:
        income (float): The user's income.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax amount.
    """
    if income > 50000:
        tax_rate = 0.20
    elif income >= 20000 and income <= 50000:
        tax_rate = 0.15
    else:
        tax_rate = 0.10

    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: "))
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)

    print(f"Your income: {income}")
    print(f"Your tax amount: {tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Your net income: {income - tax_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: Your income: 40000.0
Your tax amount: 6000.00
Your net income: 34000.00
```
