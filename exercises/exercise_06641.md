## Exercise
Write a function that uses code review to inspect and improve its code

## Reference Solution
```python
import inspect
import re

def code_review(func):
    """
    Inspect and improve the code of a given function.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to be reviewed.

    Returns:
        list: A list of suggestions for improving the code.
    """
    # Get the source code of the function
    source_code = inspect.getsource(func)

    # Initialize a list to store suggestions
    suggestions = []

    # Check for long lines
    long_lines = [line for line in source_code.split('\n') if len(line) > 80]
    if long_lines:
        suggestions.append("Break long lines into multiple lines for better readability.")

    # Check for unused imports
    unused_imports = re.findall(r"import\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)", source_code)
    for import_ in unused_imports:
        if import_ not in source_code:
            suggestions.append(f"Remove unused import '{import_}'.")

    # Check for variable naming conventions
    variable_names = re.findall(r"([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)\s*=", source_code)
    for variable_name in variable_names:
        if len(variable_name) < 3:
            suggestions.append(f"Rename variable '{variable_name}' to follow PEP 8 naming conventions.")

    # Check for function length
    function_length = len(source_code.split('\n'))
    if function_length > 20:
        suggestions.append("Break the function into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability.")

    return suggestions

# Example usage:
def example_function():
    import os
    import sys
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
    d = 4
    e = 5
    f = 6
    g = 7
    h = 8
    i = 9
    j = 10
    k = 11
    l = 12
    m = 13
    n = 14
    o = 15
    p = 16
    q = 17
    r = 18
    s = 19
    t = 20

suggestions = code_review(example_function)
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(suggestion)
```
