## Exercise
Declare two variables with initial values and perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on them

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare two variables with initial values
var1 = 10
var2 = 2

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
addition = var1 + var2
subtraction = var1 - var2
multiplication = var1 * var2
division = var1 / var2

# Print the results
print("Addition: ", addition)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)
print("Division: ", division)
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition:  12
Subtraction:  8
Multiplication:  20
Division:  5.0
```
