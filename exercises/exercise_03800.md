## Exercise
Write a function that finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of numbers.

    Args:
    - nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    - int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position.
    lengths = [1] * len(nums)

    # Iterate over the list to fill the lengths list.
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current number is greater than the previous number, update the length of the subsequence.
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], lengths[j] + 1)

    # Return the maximum length found.
    return max(lengths)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
    print("Length of the longest increasing subsequence:", longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))
```

## Generated Output
```
Length of the longest increasing subsequence: 6
```
