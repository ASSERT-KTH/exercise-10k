## Exercise
Write a function that returns another function with a closure

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(name):
    """Outer function that returns an inner function with a closure."""
    def inner_function(age):
        """Inner function with access to the outer function's scope."""
        return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
    return inner_function

# Example usage:
greet_john = outer_function("John")
print(greet_john(30))  # Output: Hello, John! You are 30 years old.

greet_jane = outer_function("Jane")
print(greet_jane(25))  # Output: Hello, Jane! You are 25 years old.
```

## Generated Output
