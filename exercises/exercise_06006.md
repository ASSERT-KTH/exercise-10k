## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10, and prints out a message indicating whether the guess is correct or not

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the number to be guessed
number_to_guess = 7

# Ask the user for their guess
user_guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

# Check if the guess is correct
if user_guess == number_to_guess:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly.")
else:
    print("Sorry, your guess is incorrect. The correct number was {}.".format(number_to_guess))
```

```python
# Define the number to be guessed
number_to_guess = 7

# Initialize a variable to track the number of attempts
attempts = 0

# Loop until the user guesses the number correctly
while True:
    # Ask the user for their guess
    user_guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

    # Increment the attempts counter
    attempts += 1

    # Check if the guess is correct
    if user_guess == number_to_guess:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly in {} attempts.".format(attempts))
        break
    else:
        print("Sorry, your guess is incorrect. Try again!")
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 10: Sorry, your guess is incorrect. The correct number was 7.
