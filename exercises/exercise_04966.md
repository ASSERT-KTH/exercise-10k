## Exercise
Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_character_occurrences(input_string: str, character: str) -> int:
    """
    Counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string.
        character (str): The character to count.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.
    """
    if len(character) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Character must be a single character")

    return input_string.count(character)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_str = "Hello, World!"
    char = "l"
    occurrences = count_character_occurrences(input_str, char)
    print(f"The character '{char}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string '{input_str}'")
```
