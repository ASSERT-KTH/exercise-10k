## Exercise
Write a function that finds the minimum of three numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_minimum(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:
    """
    This function finds the minimum of three numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.
        c (float): The third number.

    Returns:
        float: The minimum of the three numbers.
    """
    return min(a, b, c)

# Example usage:
def main():
    num1 = 10.0
    num2 = 5.0
    num3 = 20.0
    minimum = find_minimum(num1, num2, num3)
    print(f"The minimum of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {minimum}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The minimum of 10.0, 5.0, and 20.0 is 5.0.
