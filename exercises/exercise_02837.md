## Exercise
Develop a program to calculate the tax amount based on the income. If the income is above $50000, the tax rate is 20%. If the income is between $20000 and $50000, the tax rate is 15%. If the income is below $20000, the tax rate is 10%.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    """
    Calculates the tax amount based on the income.

    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax amount.
    """
    if income > 50000:
        tax_rate = 0.20
    elif 20000 <= income <= 50000:
        tax_rate = 0.15
    else:
        tax_rate = 0.10

    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount

def main():
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)
    print(f"Your tax amount is: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Your net income is: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $Your tax amount is: $4500.00
Your net income is: $25500.00
```
