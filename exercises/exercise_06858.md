## Exercise
Create a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3):
    """
    This function takes three numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, 
    multiplication, and division operations. It then returns the results of each operation.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        num3 (float): The third number.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the results of each operation.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results
    results = {}

    # Perform addition operation
    results['addition'] = num1 + num2 + num3

    # Perform subtraction operation
    results['subtraction'] = num1 - num2 - num3

    # Perform multiplication operation
    results['multiplication'] = num1 * num2 * num3

    # Perform division operation (check for division by zero)
    if num2 == 0 or num3 == 0:
        results['division'] = "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
    else:
        results['division'] = num1 / num2 / num3

    return results


# Define the main function
def main():
    """
    The main function that takes user input and calls the perform_arithmetic_operations function.
    """

    # Take user input
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

    # Call the perform_arithmetic_operations function
    results = perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3)

    # Print the results
    print("\nResults:")
    for operation, result in results.items():
        print(f"{operation.capitalize()}: {result}")


# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_1g9jgn5.py", line 59, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_1g9jgn5.py", line 44, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5 2'
```
