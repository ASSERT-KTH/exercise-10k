## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the difference between two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 - num2

def main():
    # Get user input
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate the difference
    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)

    # Print the result
    print("The difference between {:.2f} and {:.2f} is {:.2f}".format(num1, num2, difference))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpo6_8swz9.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpo6_8swz9.py", line 16, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 4'
```
