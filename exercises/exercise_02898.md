## Exercise
Design a program to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers using the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The LCM of the input integers.
    """
    lcm = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        lcm = abs(lcm * num) // math.gcd(lcm, num)
    return lcm

# Example usage:
numbers = [2, 7, 3]
print(calculate_lcm(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
42
```
