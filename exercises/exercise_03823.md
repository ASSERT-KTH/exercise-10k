## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it. If the user guesses correctly, print out a success message. If not, ask again.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def random_number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        # Ask the user to guess the number
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
        
        # Check if the user's guess is a valid number
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
            continue

        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 10.")
            continue

        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Too high! Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    random_number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 10: Too low! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 10:
