## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to simulate a bank account with 5 transactions.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a class for the bank account
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def display_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance}")


def main():
    # Create a bank account with an initial balance of $1000
    account = BankAccount(1000)

    # Define 5 transactions
    transactions = [
        {"type": "deposit", "amount": 500},
        {"type": "withdraw", "amount": 200},
        {"type": "deposit", "amount": 300},
        {"type": "withdraw", "amount": 1000},
        {"type": "deposit", "amount": 800}
    ]

    # Simulate the transactions using a for loop
    for transaction in transactions:
        if transaction["type"] == "deposit":
            account.deposit(transaction["amount"])
        elif transaction["type"] == "withdraw":
            account.withdraw(transaction["amount"])
        account.display_balance()
        print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Deposited $500. New balance: $1500
Current balance: $1500

Withdrew $200. New balance: $1300
Current balance: $1300

Deposited $300. New balance: $1600
Current balance: $1600

Withdrew $1000. New balance: $600
Current balance: $600

Deposited $800. New balance: $1400
Current balance: $1400
```
