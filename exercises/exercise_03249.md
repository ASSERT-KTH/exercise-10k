## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the squares of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the squares of the numbers.
    """
    return sum([x**2 for x in numbers])

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print("The sum of the squares is:", result)
```

```python
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    return sum(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the squares is: 55
```
