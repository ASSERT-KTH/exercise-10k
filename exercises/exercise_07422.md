## Exercise
Create a function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The function should take one argument, an integer n, and return its factorial. For example, factorial(5) should return 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. You should handle cases where n is less than 0 and raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    This function calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input integer for which the factorial is to be calculated.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input integer.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input integer is less than 0.
    """
    
    # Check if the input integer is less than 0 and raise a ValueError if true
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input integer must be greater than or equal to 0.")
    
    # Base case: If the input integer is 0 or 1, return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case: If the input integer is greater than 1, call the function with n-1 and multiply the result by n
    # This will keep calling the function until it reaches the base case and then start returning the results back up the call stack
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
