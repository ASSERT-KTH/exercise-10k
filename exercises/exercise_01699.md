## Exercise
Create a function to find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    """
    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1

    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeating character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char

    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None
    return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "aabbc"
    result = first_non_repeating_char(s)
    if result:
        print(f"The first non-repeating character is: {result}")
    else:
        print("No non-repeating character found.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The first non-repeating character is: c
```
