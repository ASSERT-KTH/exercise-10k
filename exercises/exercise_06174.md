## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a reduction as input and returns the result of applying the reduction to all elements in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduce_list(input_list, reduction):
    """
    Applies a reduction operation to all elements in a list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list of elements to be reduced.
        reduction (function): The reduction function to apply.

    Returns:
        The result of applying the reduction to all elements in the list.
    """

    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not input_list:
        raise TypeError('reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value')

    # Initialize the result with the first element of the list
    # This will be our starting point for the reduction operation
    result = input_list[0]

    # Iterate over the rest of the list (from the second element to the end)
    for element in input_list[1:]:
        # Apply the reduction function to the current result and the current element
        # The result of this operation will become the new result
        result = reduction(result, element)

    # After iterating over all elements, return the final result
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(reduce_list(numbers, add))  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
