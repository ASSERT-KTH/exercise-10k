## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades. The function should take a list of grades as input, calculate the average, and return the average grade. If the list is empty, return a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade(grades):
    """
    This function calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades.

    Args:
        grades (list): A list of grades.

    Returns:
        float: The average grade if the list is not empty, otherwise a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate.
    """

    # First, we check if the list is empty
    if not grades:
        # If the list is empty, we return a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate
        return "There are no grades to calculate."

    # If the list is not empty, we calculate the sum of all grades
    # We use the built-in sum function in Python to calculate the sum of all elements in the list
    total_grades = sum(grades)
    
    # Then, we calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades
    # We use the len function to get the number of elements in the list
    average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)
    
    # Finally, we return the average grade
    return average_grade

# Example usage:
grades = [90, 85, 95, 88, 92]
print(calculate_average_grade(grades))  # Output: 90.0
```

## Generated Output
```
90.0
```
