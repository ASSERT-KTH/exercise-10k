## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. If the string is not a palindrome, the program should reverse the string and print the reversed string. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print a message indicating that the string is a palindrome.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return s
    else:
        return s[::-1]

s = input("Enter a string: ")
print(is_palindrome(s))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: madam
```
