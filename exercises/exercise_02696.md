## Exercise
Write a program that takes two names as input and calculates a love percentage based on the following conditions: the love percentage is calculated by counting the number of matching letters in the two names and dividing it by the total number of letters in the two names.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Taking input
name1 = input("Enter the first name: ")
name2 = input("Enter the second name: ")

# Converting to lowercase
name1 = name1.lower()
name2 = name2.lower()

# Removing spaces
name1 = name1.replace(" ", "")
name2 = name2.replace(" ", "")

# Calculating total number of letters
total_letters = len(name1) + len(name2)

# Creating a copy of name1
name1_copy = name1

# Counting matching letters
love_percent = 0
for char in name2:
    if char in name1_copy:
        love_percent += 1
        name1_copy = name1_copy.replace(char, "", 1)

# Calculating love percentage
love_percent = (love_percent / total_letters) * 100

# Printing result
print("Love percentage: ", love_percent)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first name: Enter the second name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpin3j84ko.py", line 3, in <module>
    name2 = input("Enter the second name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
