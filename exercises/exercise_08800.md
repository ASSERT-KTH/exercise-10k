## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the remainder of the division.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the remainder of the division of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (float): The number being divided.
        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        float: The remainder of the division.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return dividend % divisor


def main():
    try:
        dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
        divisor = float(input("Enter the divisor: "))
        remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}.")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9ee9an2r.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9ee9an2r.py", line 22, in main
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '17 5'
