## Exercise
Return a view object that displays a list of all keys in a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_dict_keys(dictionary):
    """
    Returns a view object that displays a list of all keys in a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict_keys: A view object that displays a list of all keys in the dictionary.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is indeed a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a dictionary")

    # Now, we can use the built-in keys() method of Python dictionaries to get a view object that displays a list of all keys
    # This method returns a dict_keys object which is a view object that displays a list of all keys available in a dictionary
    keys_view = dictionary.keys()

    # Finally, we return the view object
    return keys_view

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(get_dict_keys(my_dict))  # Output: dict_keys(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

## Generated Output
```
dict_keys(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```
