## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), score >= 80 (B), score >= 70 (C), score >= 60 (D), score < 60 (F). The program should handle invalid scores and print an error message if the score is not between 0 and 100.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the given score.

    Args:
        score (int): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade.
    """

    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if not 0 <= score <= 100:
        print("Error: Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100.")
        return None

    # Check the conditions for each grade and return the corresponding grade
    if score >= 90:
        # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        # If the score is 80 or above, the grade is B
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        # If the score is 70 or above, the grade is C
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        # If the score is 60 or above, the grade is D
        return "D"
    else:
        # If the score is below 60, the grade is F
        return "F"

# Example usage:
score = 85
grade = calculate_grade(score)
if grade is not None:
    print(f"The grade for a score of {score} is {grade}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The grade for a score of 85 is B.
```
