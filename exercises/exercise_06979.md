## Exercise
Create a function that takes a graph as an argument and returns the shortest path between two nodes.

## Reference Solution
```python
import sys
import heapq

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    """
    This function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

    Args:
    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph.
    start (node): The starting node.
    end (node): The ending node.

    Returns:
    list: A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
    """

    # Initialize the distance to all nodes as infinity and the previous node in the shortest path as None
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    # Create a priority queue with the start node
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        # Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # If the current node is the end node, we've found the shortest path
        if current_node == end:
            path = []
            while current_node is not None:
                path.append(current_node)
                current_node = previous_nodes[current_node]
            path.reverse()
            return path

        # If the current distance is greater than the already known distance, skip this node
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Iterate over the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # If a shorter path to the neighbor is found, update the distance and previous node
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # If there's no path to the end node, return None
    return None

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
    }
    start_node = 'A'
    end_node = 'D'
    shortest_path_nodes = shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)
    print(f"The shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node} is: {shortest_path_nodes}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The shortest path from A to D is: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```
