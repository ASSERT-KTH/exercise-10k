## Exercise
Write a program that finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings. The program should take a list of strings as input and output the longest common prefix.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""

    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)

    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):
        for other in strs:
            if other[i] != char:
                return shortest_str[:i]

    return shortest_str

if __name__ == "__main__":
    strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
    print(longestCommonPrefix(strs))
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
```
