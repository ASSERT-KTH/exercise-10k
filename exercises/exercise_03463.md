## Exercise
Create a program that asks for a number and then prints out the number squared.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_number_from_user():
    """Get a number from the user."""
    while True:
        try:
            num = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
            return num
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number. Try again.")

def square_number(num):
    """Return the square of a number."""
    return num ** 2

def main():
    num = get_number_from_user()
    squared_num = square_number(num)
    print(f"The square of {num} is {squared_num}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a number: The square of 5.0 is 25.0.
