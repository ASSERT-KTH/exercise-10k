## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns two new lists, where the first list contains the first element of each tuple, and the second list contains the second element of each tuple.

## Reference Solution
```python
def separate_tuples(tuples_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of tuples as input and returns two new lists.
    The first list contains the first element of each tuple, and the second list contains the second element of each tuple.

    Args:
        tuples_list (list): A list of tuples.

    Returns:
        tuple: Two lists, the first containing the first elements of the tuples and the second containing the second elements.
    """

    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements of the tuples
    first_elements = []
    
    # Initialize another empty list to store the second elements of the tuples
    second_elements = []

    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Append the first element of the current tuple to the first_elements list
        first_elements.append(tup[0])
        
        # Append the second element of the current tuple to the second_elements list
        second_elements.append(tup[1])

    # Return the two lists
    return first_elements, second_elements

# Example usage:
tuples_list = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
first, second = separate_tuples(tuples_list)
print("First elements:", first)
print("Second elements:", second)
```

## Generated Output
```
First elements: [1, 3, 5]
Second elements: [2, 4, 6]
```
