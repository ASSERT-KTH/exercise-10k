## Exercise
Write a program that allows the user to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    elif user_score < computer_score:
        print("Computer wins the series. Better luck next time!")
    else:
        print("The series is a tie!")

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    while True:
        print("\n1. Play a single game")
        print("2. Play a best-of-three series")

if __name__ == "__main__":
