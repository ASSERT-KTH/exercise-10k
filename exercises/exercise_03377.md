## Exercise
Use a for loop to generate a list of factorials up to a given limit

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_factorials(limit):
    """
    Generates a list of factorials up to a given limit.

    Args:
    limit (int): The maximum number for which the factorial is calculated.

    Returns:
    list: A list of factorials up to the given limit.
    """
    factorials = []
    factorial = 1

    for i in range(1, limit + 1):
        factorial *= i
        factorials.append(factorial)

    return factorials

# Example usage
limit = 5
factorials = generate_factorials(limit)
print("Factorials up to", limit, "are:", factorials)
```

## Generated Output
```
Factorials up to 5 are: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
```
