## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a new dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of student names who received that grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def group_students_by_grade(grades_dict):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input.
    It returns a new dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of student names who received that grade.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and grades as values.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with grades as keys and lists of student names as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the result
    result = {}

    # Iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary
    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():
        # Check if the grade is already a key in the result dictionary
        if grade not in result:
            # If not, add it as a key with an empty list as its value
            result[grade] = []
        
        # Append the student's name to the list of students with the same grade
        result[grade].append(student)

    # Return the resulting dictionary
    return result

# Example usage:
grades = {
    "Alice": 90,
    "Bob": 85,
    "Charlie": 90,
    "David": 80,
    "Eve": 85
}

print(group_students_by_grade(grades))
```

## Generated Output
```
{90: ['Alice', 'Charlie'], 85: ['Bob', 'Eve'], 80: ['David']}
```
