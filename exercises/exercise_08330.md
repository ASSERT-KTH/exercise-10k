## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, along with their squares. The output should be in the format 'Number: X, Square: Y', where X is the number and Y is the square of the number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, along with their squares.
# The output should be in the format 'Number: X, Square: Y', where X is the number and Y is the square of the number.

# Define a variable to keep track of the current number
i = 1

# Start a while loop that continues as long as the current number is less than or equal to 10
while i <= 10:
    # Calculate the square of the current number
    square = i ** 2

    # Print out the current number and its square in the desired format
    print("Number: " + str(i) + ", Square: " + str(square))

    # Increment the current number by 1
    i = i + 1
```

## Generated Output
```
Number: 1, Square: 1
Number: 2, Square: 4
Number: 3, Square: 9
Number: 4, Square: 16
Number: 5, Square: 25
Number: 6, Square: 36
Number: 7, Square: 49
Number: 8, Square: 64
Number: 9, Square: 81
Number: 10, Square: 100
