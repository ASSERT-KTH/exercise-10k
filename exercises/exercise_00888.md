## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for a year and prints out whether it is a leap year or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    """
    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)

def main():
    # Get the year from the user
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    # Check if the year is a leap year
    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
