## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent

## Reference Solution
```python
def power(base, exponent):
    """
    Calculate the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.

    Args:
    base (float): The base number.
    exponent (float): The exponent.

    Returns:
    float: The result of the exponentiation.
    """
    return base ** exponent

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    base = 2
    exponent = 3
    result = power(base, exponent)
    print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```
