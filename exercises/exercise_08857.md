## Exercise
Create a function to check if a given number is a perfect cube or not

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_perfect_cube(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a perfect cube or not.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a perfect cube, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    cube_root = round(n ** (1. / 3))
    return cube_root ** 3 == n

# Example usage:
def main():
    numbers = [27, 64, 125, 10, 15]
    for num in numbers:
        if is_perfect_cube(num):
            print(f"{num} is a perfect cube.")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is not a perfect cube.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
27 is a perfect cube.
64 is a perfect cube.
125 is a perfect cube.
10 is not a perfect cube.
15 is not a perfect cube.
```
