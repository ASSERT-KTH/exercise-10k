## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the frequency of each element in the array. The program should output a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the array and the values are their respective frequencies.

## Reference Solution
```python
from typing import Dict, List

def get_frequency_of_elements(arr: List[int]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    """
    This function takes an array of integers as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the array.
    
    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[int, int]: A dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the array and the values are their respective frequencies.
    """
    frequency = {}
    for element in arr:
        if element not in frequency:
            frequency[element] = 1
        else:
            frequency[element] += 1
    return frequency
```
