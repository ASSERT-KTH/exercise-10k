## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5. If the list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, raise a ValueError.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_multiples(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of numbers in a list that are multiples of 3 or 5.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5.
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5
        if num % 3 != 0 and num % 5 != 0:
            # If it's not a multiple, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("The list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5")
        
        # Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5
        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
            # If it's a multiple, add it to the sum
            total_sum += num
    
    # Return the total sum
    return total_sum
```
