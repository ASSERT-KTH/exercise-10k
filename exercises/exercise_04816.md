## Exercise
Given an array of integers and a number k, find the top k frequent elements in the array. The function should take in an array of integers and a number k as input and return the top k frequent elements.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def top_k_frequent(nums, k):
    """
    Find the top k frequent elements in the array.

    Args:
    - nums (list): A list of integers.
    - k (int): The number of top frequent elements to return.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of the top k frequent elements.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each element
    count = Counter(nums)
    
    # Use a heap to find the top k frequent elements
    return heapq.nlargest(k, count.keys(), key=count.get)

# Example usage
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(top_k_frequent(nums, k))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2]
```
