## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def game():
    while True:
        # Get the user's choice
        user_choice = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()

        # Validate the user's choice
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

        # Get the computer's choice
        choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        # Print out the choices
        print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\n")

        # Determine the winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif user_choice == "rock":
            if computer_choice == "scissors":
                print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
            else:
                print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
        elif user_choice == "paper":
            if computer_choice == "rock":
                print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
            else:
                print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
        elif user_choice == "scissors":
            if computer_choice == "paper":
                print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
            else:
                print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")

        # Ask the user if they want to play again
        play_again = input("Play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        while play_again not in ["yes", "no"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: ").lower()

        if play_again != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors:

    user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
