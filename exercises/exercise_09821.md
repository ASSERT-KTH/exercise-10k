## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the list. The function should handle empty lists and lists with a single element. The function should also handle lists with duplicate numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(num_list):
    """
    This function calculates the average of a list of integers.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, it returns None.
    """

    # First, we check if the list is empty. If it is, we return None.
    if not num_list:
        return None

    # Next, we calculate the sum of all numbers in the list. We use the built-in sum function for this.
    # The sum function adds up all elements in the given iterable (in this case, our list).
    total_sum = sum(num_list)

    # Then, we calculate the length of the list. We use the built-in len function for this.
    # The len function returns the number of items in an object (in this case, our list).
    list_length = len(num_list)

    # Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
    # We use floating point division (/) to ensure that we get a float result, even if the division is not exact.
    average = total_sum / list_length

    # We return the calculated average.
    return average
```
