## Exercise
Write a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (integer, float, character, string) and then prints their values. Use meaningful variable names and include comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declaration and Initialization
integerVariable = 10
floatVariable = 3.14159
charVariable = 'A'
stringVariable = "This is a string variable"

# Printing the Values
print(integerVariable)
print(floatVariable)
print(charVariable)
print(stringVariable)
```

## Generated Output
```
10
3.14159
A
This is a string variable
```
