## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and loops through all the keys in the dictionary, printing out each key.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_dictionary_keys(input_dict):
    """
    Loops through all the keys in the dictionary and prints each key.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to loop through.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    for key in input_dict.keys():
        print(key)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "cherry": 3}
    print_dictionary_keys(example_dict)
```
