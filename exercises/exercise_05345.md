## Exercise
Create a function that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from both lists, in the order they appeared in the input lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function combines two lists into one, preserving the original order of elements.
    
    Parameters:
    list1 (list): The first list to be combined.
    list2 (list): The second list to be combined.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.
    """
    
    # First, we need to create a new empty list that will store the combined elements
    combined_list = []
    
    # We'll start by adding all elements from the first list to our combined list
    # This is done using the extend method, which adds all elements from one list to another
    combined_list.extend(list1)
    
    # Now, we'll do the same for the second list, adding all its elements to our combined list
    combined_list.extend(list2)
    
    # Finally, we return the combined list, which now contains all elements from both input lists
    return combined_list

# Alternatively, you can use the + operator to concatenate two lists in a more concise way
def combine_lists_concise(list1, list2):
    """
    This function combines two lists into one, preserving the original order of elements.
    
    Parameters:
    list1 (list): The first list to be combined.
    list2 (list): The second list to be combined.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.
    """
    
    # We can use the + operator to concatenate the two lists directly
    # This creates a new list containing all elements from both input lists
    return list1 + list2
```
