## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of pairs as input, and returns two separate lists containing the first and second elements of each pair.

## Reference Solution
```python
def separate(x):
    first = [i[0] for i in x]
    second = [i[1] for i in x]
    return first, second

pairs = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
first, second = separate(pairs)
print(first)  # [1, 3, 5]
print(second)  # [2, 4, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 3, 5]
[2, 4, 6]
```
