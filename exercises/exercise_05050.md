## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculates the mean of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers."""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
    
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mean: 3.0
Standard Deviation: 1.5811388300841898
```
