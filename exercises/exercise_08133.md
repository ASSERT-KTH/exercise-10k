## Exercise
Write a program that checks the strength of a password using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password_strength(password):
    """
    Checks the strength of a password.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to check.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating the strength of the password.
    """
    errors = []

    # Check length
    if len(password) < 8:
        errors.append("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")

    # Check for uppercase letters
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.")

    # Check for lowercase letters
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.")

    # Check for numbers
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should contain at least one number.")

    # Check for special characters
    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should contain at least one special character.")

    # Return the result
    if len(errors) == 0:
        return "Password is strong."
    else:
        return "Password is weak. The following errors were found:\n" + "\n".join(errors)


def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    print(check_password_strength(password))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password is weak. The following errors were found:
Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
Password should contain at least one special character.
```
