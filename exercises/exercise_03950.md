## Exercise
Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a piece of text.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_character_frequencies(text):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each character in a piece of text.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the unique characters in the text and the values are their corresponding frequencies.
    """
    frequency_dict = {}
    for char in text:
        if char in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[char] = 1
    return frequency_dict

def main():
    text = input("Enter a piece of text: ")
    frequency_dict = count_character_frequencies(text)
    print("Character Frequencies:")
    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():
        print(f"{char}: {frequency}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a piece of text: Character Frequencies:
H: 1
e: 1
l: 3
o: 2
,: 1
 : 1
W: 1
r: 1
d: 1
!: 1
```
