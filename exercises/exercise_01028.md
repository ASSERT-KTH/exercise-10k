## Exercise
Create a program to sort a list of numbers using bubble sort.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(numbers):
    """
    Sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of numbers.
    """
    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(numbers)

    # Repeat the process until the list is sorted
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize a flag to check if any swaps were made
        swapped = False

        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n - i - 1)th element
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:
                # Swap the elements
                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]
                # Set the flag to True
                swapped = True

        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the list is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    # Return the sorted list
    return numbers


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

    # Print the original list
    print("Original list:", numbers)

    # Sort the list using bubble sort
    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)

    # Print the sorted list
    print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
