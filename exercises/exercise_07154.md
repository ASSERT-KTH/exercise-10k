## Exercise
Write a program that takes two functions as input and returns their composition. The first function should take one argument and return a value, and the second function should take one argument and return a value. The composition of the two functions should be a new function that takes one argument and returns the result of applying the second function to the result of applying the first function.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose_functions(func1, func2):
    """
    This function takes two functions as input and returns their composition.
    
    The first function should take one argument and return a value, 
    and the second function should take one argument and return a value.
    
    The composition of the two functions is a new function that takes one argument 
    and returns the result of applying the second function to the result of applying the first function.

    Args:
        func1 (function): The first function to be composed.
        func2 (function): The second function to be composed.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.
    """

    # Define a new function that will be the composition of func1 and func2
    def composed_function(arg):
        
        # First, apply func1 to the argument
        result_from_func1 = func1(arg)
        
        # Then, apply func2 to the result from func1
        result_from_func2 = func2(result_from_func1)
        
        # Return the final result
        return result_from_func2
    
    # Return the composed function
    return composed_function

# Example usage:

# Define two simple functions
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

# Compose the functions
composed = compose_functions(double, add_one)

# Test the composed function
print(composed(5))  # Output: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
