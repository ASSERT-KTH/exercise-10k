## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a password until they enter a valid one. A valid password should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def is_valid_password(password):
    """
    Checks if the password is valid.
    
    A valid password should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, 
    one lowercase letter, and one digit.
    
    Parameters:
    password (str): The password to be checked.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        return False
    
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        return False
    
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        return False
    
    return True

def main():
    """
    Continuously asks the user for a password until they enter a valid one.
    """
    while True:
        password = input("Please enter a password: ")
        
        if is_valid_password(password):
            print("Password is valid. You may proceed.")
            break
        else:
            print("Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:")
            print("  - At least 8 characters long")
            print("  - Contains at least one uppercase letter")
            print("  - Contains at least one lowercase letter")
            print("  - Contains at least one digit")
            print("Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a password: Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:
  - At least 8 characters long
  - Contains at least one uppercase letter
  - Contains at least one lowercase letter
  - Contains at least one digit
