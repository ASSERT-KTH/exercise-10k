## Exercise
Create a function that takes a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades. The function should return a new dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades. Round the average grades to two decimal places.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    This function calculates the average grades of students from a given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary where keys are student names and values are their average grades.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades
    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary
    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():
        # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student
        total_grades = sum(grades)
        
        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades
        average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)
        
        # Round the average grade to two decimal places
        average_grade = round(average_grade, 2)
        
        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades
    return average_grades

# Example usage:
grades_dict = {
    'John': [90, 85, 95],
    'Alice': [88, 92, 89],
    'Bob': [76, 81, 85]
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)
print(average_grades)
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 90.0, 'Alice': 89.67, 'Bob': 80.67}
```
