## Exercise
Write a program that acts as a chatbot using a while loop to handle user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a dictionary of possible responses
responses = {
    "hello": ["Hi, how are you?", "Hello! What's up?", "Hey, how's it going?"],
    "how are you": ["I'm good, thanks!", "I'm doing well, thanks for asking!", "I'm just a chatbot, I don't have feelings."],
    "what's your name": ["I'm a chatbot, I don't have a name.", "You can call me Bot.", "I'm an AI, I don't have a personal name."],
    "quit": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "It was nice chatting with you."]
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """Return a random response based on the user's input."""
    user_input = user_input.lower()
    for key in responses:
        if key in user_input:
            return random.choice(responses[key])
    return "I didn't understand that. Please try again."

def main():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "quit":
            print("Chatbot: ", get_response(user_input))
            break
        else:
            print("Chatbot: ", get_response(user_input))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
You: Chatbot:  Hello! What's up?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmptf1zzjzb.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmptf1zzjzb.py", line 23, in main
    user_input = input("You: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
