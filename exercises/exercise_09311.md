## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of strings and a separator as input and returns the joined string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def join_strings(string_list, separator):
    """
    This function joins a list of strings with a specified separator.

    Args:
        string_list (list): A list of strings to be joined.
        separator (str): The separator used to join the strings.

    Returns:
        str: The joined string.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are strings
    if not isinstance(string_list, list) or not all(isinstance(s, str) for s in string_list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list of strings")

    # Then, we check if the separator is a string
    if not isinstance(separator, str):
        raise TypeError("Separator must be a string")

    # Now, we use the join method of the separator string to join all strings in the list
    # The join method returns a string in which the elements of the list have been joined by the separator
    joined_string = separator.join(string_list)

    # Finally, we return the joined string
    return joined_string

# Example usage:
print(join_strings(["Hello", "world", "this", "is", "a", "test"], " "))
```
