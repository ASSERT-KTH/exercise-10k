# Defining the Program
def main():
    # Getting User Input
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    # Printing the Greeting Message
    print("Hello, " + name)

    # Checking if the User is an Adult
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult.")
    else:
        print("You are not an adult.")

# Running the Program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
