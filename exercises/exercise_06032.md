## Exercise
Write a function that uses the filter function to get all even numbers from a list. Use the function to get the even numbers from the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a list of even numbers from the input list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of even integers.
    """
    return list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]
```
