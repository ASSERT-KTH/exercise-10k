## Exercise
Write a function that uses the filter function to filter a list of numbers based on a given condition

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
    """
    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns a boolean.

    Returns:
        list: The filtered list of numbers.
    """
    return list(filter(condition, numbers))

# Example usage:
def is_even(num):
    """Return True if the number is even, False otherwise."""
    return num % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
