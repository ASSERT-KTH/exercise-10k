## Exercise
Write a program that takes the initial velocity, final velocity, and time as input and returns the acceleration.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time):
    """
    Calculate the acceleration of an object.

    Args:
        initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object.
        final_velocity (float): The final velocity of the object.
        time (float): The time over which the acceleration occurs.

    Returns:
        float: The acceleration of the object.
    """
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero")

    acceleration = (final_velocity - initial_velocity) / time
    return acceleration

def main():
    # Get user input
    initial_velocity = float(input("Enter the initial velocity (m/s): "))
    final_velocity = float(input("Enter the final velocity (m/s): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time (s): "))

    # Calculate acceleration
    acceleration = calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time)

    # Print result
    print(f"The acceleration is {acceleration} m/s^2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the initial velocity (m/s): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpo5eopt33.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpo5eopt33.py", line 21, in main
    initial_velocity = float(input("Enter the initial velocity (m/s): "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '0 10 2'
```
