## Exercise
Create a program that implements a game of Hangman using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# List of words to choose from
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

def hangman():
    # Choose a random word from the list
    word = random.choice(words)
    word_length = len(word)
    
    # Initialize the display with underscores
    display = ['_'] * word_length
    guessed = False
    guessed_letters = []
    guessed_words = []
    tries = 6
    
    print("Let's play Hangman!")
    print(display_hangman(tries))
    print(' '.join(display))
    
    while not guessed and tries > 0:
        guess = input("Please guess a letter or word: ").lower()
        
        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():
            if guess in guessed_letters:
                print("You already guessed the letter", guess)
