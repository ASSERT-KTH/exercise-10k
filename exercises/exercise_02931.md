## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence

def main():
    # Get the number of terms from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence
    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)

    # Print the Fibonacci sequence
    print("Fibonacci Sequence:")
    for i, num in enumerate(fib_sequence):
        print(f"F({i}) = {num}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms: Fibonacci Sequence:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
