## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The function should be case-sensitive and should not remove any characters from the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(input_str):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
    
    The function is case-sensitive and does not remove any characters from the string.

    Parameters:
    input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.

    Returns:
    str: The reversed string.
    """

    # We will use Python's slicing feature to reverse the string
    # The syntax for slicing is [start:stop:step], where start is the starting index, 
    # stop is the ending index, and step is the increment between elements in the slice
    # To reverse a string, we can use a step of -1, which means we start at the end of the string 
    # and move backwards to the beginning

    # Now, we will use the slicing feature to reverse the input string
    reversed_str = input_str[::-1]
    
    # Finally, we return the reversed string
    return reversed_str

# Example usage:
print(reverse_string("Hello, World!"))  # Outputs: "!dlroW ,olleH"
```

## Generated Output
```
!dlroW ,olleH
```
