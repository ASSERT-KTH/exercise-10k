## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string as input and returns all possible palindromes that can be formed using the characters in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from itertools import permutations

def find_palindromes(s):
    # Generate all permutations of the string
    perms = set(permutations(s))

    # Filter out the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    for perm in perms:
        word = ''.join(perm)
        if word == word[::-1]:
            palindromes.add(word)

    return palindromes

# Test the function
s = "aab"
print(find_palindromes(s))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'aba'}
```
