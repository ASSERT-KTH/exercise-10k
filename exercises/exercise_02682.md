## Exercise
Write a program that takes a score as input and converts it to a grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_score_to_grade(score):
    """
    Converts a score to a grade based on the following conditions:
    A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

    Args:
        score (float): The score to be converted.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'


def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter your score: "))
            if score < 0 or score > 100:
                print("Score must be between 0 and 100.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Convert the score to a grade and print it
    grade = convert_score_to_grade(score)
    print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is: B
```
