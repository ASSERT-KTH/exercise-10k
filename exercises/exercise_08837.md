## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is odd. Use a for loop or a while loop to achieve this.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_odd_numbers():
    """
    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10.
    """
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(i)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Odd numbers from 1 to 10:")
    print_odd_numbers()
```

```python
def print_odd_numbers_while():
    """
    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
    """
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(i)
        i += 1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Odd numbers from 1 to 10 (while loop):")
    print_odd_numbers_while()
```

## Generated Output
```
Odd numbers from 1 to 10:
1
3
5
7
9
```
