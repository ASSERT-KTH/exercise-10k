## Exercise
Write a function that simulates a quiz show, asking the user a series of questions and keeping track of their score.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define the quiz questions and answers
quiz_questions = {
    "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": "Jupiter",
    "Who painted the Mona Lisa?": "Leonardo da Vinci",
    "What is the chemical symbol for gold?": "Au",
    "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?": "William Shakespeare"
}

def quiz_show():
    """
    Simulate a quiz show by asking the user a series of questions and keeping track of their score.
    """
    # Initialize the score
    score = 0
    
    # Ask each question and get the user's answer
    for question, answer in quiz_questions.items():
        user_answer = input(question + " ")
        
        # Check if the user's answer matches the correct answer
        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\n")
    
    # Display the final score
    print(f"Quiz over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    quiz_show()
```

## Generated Output
```
What is the capital of France? Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is Paris.

What is the largest planet in our solar system?
