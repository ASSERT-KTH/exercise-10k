## Exercise
Write a program to find the longest common subsequence of two strings.

## Reference Solution
```python
def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
    """
    Find the longest common subsequence of two strings.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first input string.
        str2 (str): The second input string.

    Returns:
        str: The longest common subsequence of str1 and str2.
    """
    m = len(str1)
    n = len(str2)

    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array
    lcs = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    # Return the longest common subsequence as a string
    return "".join(reversed(lcs))


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    str1 = "AGGTAB"
    str2 = "GXTXAYB"
    lcs = longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2)
    print(f"Longest Common Subsequence: {lcs}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Longest Common Subsequence: GTAB
```
