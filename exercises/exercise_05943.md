## Exercise
Create a program that asks for the user's name and age, and then prints out a personalized greeting with their name and a message based on their age group (e.g., 'child', 'teen', 'adult').

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the datetime module
import datetime

# Ask for the user's name and age
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Define age groups and corresponding messages
if age < 13:
    age_group = "child"
elif 13 <= age < 20:
    age_group = "teen"
else:
    age_group = "adult"

# Print a greeting message
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are a {age_group}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5l2jqsvh.py", line 6, in <module>
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
