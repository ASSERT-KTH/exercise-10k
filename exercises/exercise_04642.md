## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user can choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the program generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock") or \
       (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: ")
        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':
            break
        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()
        if user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: 
You chose: Rock
Computer chose: Scissors

You win!
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit:
