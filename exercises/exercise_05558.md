## Exercise
Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Tribonacci sequence using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def tribonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 0, 1]
    i = 3
    while i < n:
        sequence.append(sum(sequence[-3:]))
        i += 1
    return sequence

print(tribonacci(10))
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44]
```
