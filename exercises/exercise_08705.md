## Exercise
Ask the user for a starting number and an ending number, then print out the numbers in sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_number_sequence():
    # Get the starting and ending numbers from the user
    start_num = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
    end_num = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

    # Validate the input to ensure start_num is less than or equal to end_num
    while start_num > end_num:
        print("The starting number should be less than or equal to the ending number.")
        start_num = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
        end_num = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

    # Print the numbers in sequence
    for num in range(start_num, end_num + 1):
        print(num)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_number_sequence()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the starting number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpfmxya2y4.py", line 18, in <module>
    print_number_sequence()
  File "/tmp/tmpfmxya2y4.py", line 3, in print_number_sequence
    start_num = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 10'
