## Exercise
Create a program that uses nested for loops to sort a list using the insertion sort algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts a list in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.

    Args:
    arr (list): The list to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.
    """
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        # greater than key, to one position ahead
        # of their current position
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original list:", arr)
print("Sorted list:", insertion_sort(arr))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
