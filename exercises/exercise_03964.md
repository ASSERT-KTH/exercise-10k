## Exercise
Implement the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted list of integers. The program should take a sorted list and a target element as input and output the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

## Reference Solution
```python
def binary_search(numbers, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(numbers) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        guess = numbers[mid]
        if guess == target:
            return mid
        elif guess > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return -1

numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 3
print(binary_search(numbers, target))  # Output: 1
```

## Generated Output
```
