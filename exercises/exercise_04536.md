## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input and returns two lists: one containing the elements that satisfy the condition and one containing the elements that do not satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition(lst, condition):
    """
    Partition a list into two lists based on a condition.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the elements that satisfy the condition,
            and the second list contains the elements that do not satisfy the condition.
    """
    true_list = [item for item in lst if condition(item)]
    false_list = [item for item in lst if not condition(item)]
    return true_list, false_list

# Example usage:
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition(numbers, is_even)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5]
```
