## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's input and converts it to different data types. The program should ask the user for their name, age, and height, and then store these values in variables of appropriate data types (string for name, integer for age, and float for height).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Variables and Data Types

# Introduction
print("Welcome to the program that takes user input and converts it to different data types.")

# User Input
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
height = float(input("Please enter your height in meters: "))

# Output
print(f"Hello {name}")
print(f"You are {age} years old")
print(f"You are {height} meters tall")
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the program that takes user input and converts it to different data types.
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Please enter your height in meters: Hello John Doe
You are 25 years old
You are 1.75 meters tall
```
