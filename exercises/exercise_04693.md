## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the similarity between two strings using the Jaro-Winkler distance.

## Reference Solution
```python
import jellyfish

def jaro_winkler_similarity(s1: str, s2: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the Jaro-Winkler similarity between two strings.

    Args:
    s1 (str): The first string.
    s2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
    float: The Jaro-Winkler similarity, ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (exact match).
    """
    return jellyfish.jaro_winkler_similarity(s1, s2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = "martha"
    s2 = "marhta"
    similarity = jaro_winkler_similarity(s1, s2)
    print(f"Jaro-Winkler similarity between '{s1}' and '{s2}': {similarity:.4f}")
```

```python
pip install jellyfish
```
