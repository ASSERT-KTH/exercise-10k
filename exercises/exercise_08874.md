## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_quotient(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the quotient of two numbers.

    Args:
        dividend (float): The number being divided.
        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        float: The quotient of the two numbers.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return dividend / divisor

def main():
    # Get user input
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = float(input("Enter the divisor: "))

    try:
        quotient = calculate_quotient(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"The quotient of {dividend} and {divisor} is {quotient}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp1qw1xrmx.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp1qw1xrmx.py", line 21, in main
    dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 2'
