## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x, y).

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

# Example usage
point1 = (1, 2)
point2 = (4, 6)
distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
print(f"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) is 5.00
```
