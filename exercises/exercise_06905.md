## Exercise
Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age. The program should then print out a greeting message with the user's name and tell them how old they will be in 5 years.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Get user's name and age."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")

    return name, age


def print_greeting_and_future_age(name, age):
    """Print a greeting message and the user's age in 5 years."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    future_age = age + 5
    print(f"In 5 years, you will be {future_age} years old.")


def main():
    """Main function to run the program."""
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print_greeting_and_future_age(name, age)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
