## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball, where the user asks a question and the program provides a random answer (e.g., 'It is certain', 'Reply hazy try again', etc.)

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# Define a list of possible Magic 8-Ball answers
answers = [
    'It is certain',
    'It is decidedly so',
    'Without a doubt',
    'Yes definitely',
    'You may rely on it',
    'As I see it, yes',
    'Most likely',
    'Outlook good',
    'Yes',
    'Signs point to yes',
    'Reply hazy try again',
    'Ask again later',
    'Better not tell you now',
    'Cannot predict now',
    'Concentrate and ask again',
    'Don\'t count on it',
    'My reply is no',
    'My sources say no',
    'Outlook not so good',
    'Very doubtful'
]

def get_answer():
    """Returns a random Magic 8-Ball answer."""
    return random.choice(answers)

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball simulator!")
    while True:
        question = input("Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): ")
        if question.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        answer = get_answer()
        print(f"The Magic 8-Ball says: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball simulator!
Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): The Magic 8-Ball says: Yes
Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit):

    question = input("Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): ")
