## Exercise
Write a function that generates a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and plays a game against the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    """
    Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.
    """
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0

    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'quit' to exit: ").lower()
        if user_choice == 'quit':
            break
        elif user_choice not in choices:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.")
            continue

        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
        print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\n")

        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif user_choice == 'rock':
            if computer_choice == 'scissors':
                print("Rock smashes scissors! You win this round.")
                user_score += 1
            else:
                print("Paper covers rock! Computer wins this round.")
                computer_score += 1
        elif user_choice == 'paper':
            if computer_choice == 'rock':
                print("Paper covers rock! You win this round.")
                user_score += 1
            else:
                print("Scissors cuts paper! Computer wins this round.")
                computer_score += 1
        elif user_choice == 'scissors':
            if computer_choice == 'paper':
                print("Scissors cuts paper! You win this round.")
                user_score += 1
            else:
                print("Rock smashes scissors! Computer wins this round.")
                computer_score += 1

        print(f"Score - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\n")

    print(f"Final Score - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}")
    if user_score > computer_score:
        print("You win the game! Congratulations!")
    elif user_score < computer_score:
        print("Computer wins the game! Better luck next time!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie game!")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_rock_paper_scissors()
```

## Generated Output
