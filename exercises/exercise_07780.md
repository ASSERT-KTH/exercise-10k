## Exercise
Write a program to analyze data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary contains student information with keys as student names and values as another dictionary containing their grades for different subjects. Calculate the average grade for each student and print the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has all grades above 90, mark them as 'Outstanding', otherwise, mark them as 'Needs Improvement'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def analyze_student_data(student_data):
    """
    Analyze student data stored in a dictionary and calculate the average grade for each student.
    
    Args:
        student_data (dict): A dictionary containing student information with keys as student names and values as another dictionary containing their grades for different subjects.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    for student, grades in student_data.items():
        # Calculate the average grade
        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
        
        # Check if the student has all grades above 90
        if all(grade > 90 for grade in grades.values()):
            performance = 'Outstanding'
        else:
            performance = 'Needs Improvement'
        
        # Print the student's name, average grade, and performance
        print(f"Student: {student}, Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}, Performance: {performance}")


# Example usage:
student_data = {
    'John': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 92, 'English': 98},
    'Alice': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 85, 'English': 90},
    'Bob': {'Math': 98, 'Science': 95, 'English': 99}
}

analyze_student_data(student_data)
```

## Generated Output
```
Student: John, Average Grade: 95.00, Performance: Outstanding
Student: Alice, Average Grade: 85.00, Performance: Needs Improvement
Student: Bob, Average Grade: 97.33, Performance: Outstanding
```
