## Exercise
Create a program that plays a guessing game using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the random module to generate a random number
import random

def guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    # Initialize the number of tries
    tries = 0

    print("Welcome to the guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue

        # Increment the number of tries
        tries += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            # If the user's guess is correct, print a success message and exit the loop
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too low! Try again.
Take a guess: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpz5kui78q.py", line 37, in <module>
    guessing_game()
  File "/tmp/tmpz5kui78q.py", line 15, in guessing_game
    user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
