## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and then prints out a mad lib story using these words.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get user input
def get_user_input():
    """Ask user for noun, verb, and adjective."""
    noun = input("Please enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
    adjective = input("Please enter an adjective: ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

# Create mad lib story
def create_mad_lib(noun, verb, adjective):
    """Create a mad lib story using the given words."""
    story = f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. " \
            f"Suddenly, it started to {verb} and everyone was shocked. " \
            f"The {noun} continued to {verb} until it reached the park, " \
            f"where it met a group of {adjective} friends."
    return story

# Main function
def main():
    """Run the mad lib program."""
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    story = create_mad_lib(noun, verb, adjective)
    print("Here is your mad lib story:")
    print(story)

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a noun: Please enter a verb: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmppz7daovs.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmppz7daovs.py", line 21, in main
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
  File "/tmp/tmppz7daovs.py", line 5, in get_user_input
    verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
