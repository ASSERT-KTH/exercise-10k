## Exercise
Create a program that takes an arithmetic expression as input and evaluates it.

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_expression(expression):
    """
    Evaluates an arithmetic expression.

    Args:
        expression (str): The arithmetic expression to evaluate.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the evaluation.
    """
    try:
        # Use eval() function to evaluate the expression
        result = eval(expression)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any exceptions that occur during evaluation
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    # Example usage
    expression = input("Enter an arithmetic expression: ")
    result = evaluate_expression(expression)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"The result is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter an arithmetic expression: The result is: 14
```
