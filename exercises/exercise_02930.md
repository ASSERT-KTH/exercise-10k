## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their score and calculate their grade based on a given threshold.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# Description: A program to calculate student grades based on their scores

def student_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    while True:
        score = input("Enter your score (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if score.lower() == 'q':
            break
        score = int(score)
        grade = student_grade(score)
        print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score (or 'q' to quit): Your grade is: B
Enter your score (or 'q' to quit): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpugq37qpf.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpugq37qpf.py", line 19, in main
    score = input("Enter your score (or 'q' to quit): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
