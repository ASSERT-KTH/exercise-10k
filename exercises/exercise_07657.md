## Exercise
Create a function to calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the list of numbers.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("The list cannot be empty")

    # Calculate the mean of the list
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the variance of the list
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the standard deviation of the list
    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    return standard_deviation

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))
```

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    return np.std(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))
```
