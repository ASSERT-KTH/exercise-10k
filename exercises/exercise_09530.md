## Exercise
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, and finally print the numbers from 1 to 10 again, but this time with a '*' symbol after each number. Use either a for loop or a while loop for each part of the task.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Print numbers from 1 to 10
print("Numbers from 1 to 10:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

# Print numbers from 10 to 1
print("\nNumbers from 10 to 1:")
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)

# Print numbers from 1 to 10 with '*' symbol
print("\nNumbers from 1 to 10 with '*' symbol:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i}*")
```
