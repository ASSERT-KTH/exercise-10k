## Exercise
Create a program that handles a basic error (e.g. division by zero) and prints out an error message, then print out the error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        print(f"{a} divided by {b} is {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

# Test the function with valid input
divide_numbers(10, 2)

# Test the function with invalid input
divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

## Generated Output
```
10 divided by 2 is 5.0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
```
