        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return min(numbers)


def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]
    try:
        min_number = find_min(numbers)
        print(f"The minimum number is: {min_number}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
