## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to perform a binary search on a given list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a given list of numbers.

    Args:
        arr (list): A sorted list of numbers.
        target (int): The number to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target number if found, -1 otherwise.
    """

    # Initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    # Continue the search while the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer
    while low <= high:
        # Calculate the mid index
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        # If the target is found at the mid index, return the mid index
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid

        # If the target is less than the mid element, update the high pointer
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1

        # If the target is greater than the mid element, update the low pointer
        else:
            low = mid + 1

    # If the target is not found, return -1
    return -1


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sorted list of numbers
    numbers = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]

    # Define the target number to search for
    target_number = 23

    # Perform the binary search
    result = binary_search(numbers, target_number)

    # Print the result
    if result != -1:
        print(f"The target number {target_number} is found at index {result}.")
    else:
        print(f"The target number {target_number} is not found in the list.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The target number 23 is found at index 5.
```
