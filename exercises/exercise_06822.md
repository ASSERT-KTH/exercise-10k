## Exercise
Create a function called calculate_gpa that takes a dictionary of courses with their respective grades as input. The function should calculate the grade point average based on the given grades. Assume that A grade is 4 points, B grade is 3 points, C grade is 2 points, D grade is 1 point, and F grade is 0 points.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gpa(grades):
    """
    Calculate the grade point average (GPA) based on a dictionary of courses with their respective grades.

    Args:
        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are course names and values are grades (A, B, C, D, F).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated GPA.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input dictionary is empty or if a grade is not one of the expected values (A, B, C, D, F).
    """

    # Define the grade point mapping
    grade_points = {
        'A': 4,
        'B': 3,
        'C': 2,
        'D': 1,
        'F': 0
    }

    # Check if the input dictionary is empty
    if not grades:
        raise ValueError("Input dictionary cannot be empty")

    # Initialize the total points and course count
    total_points = 0
    course_count = 0

    # Iterate over the courses and grades
    for course, grade in grades.items():
        # Check if the grade is valid
        if grade not in grade_points:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid grade '{grade}' for course '{course}'")

        # Add the grade points to the total
        total_points += grade_points[grade]
        course_count += 1

    # Calculate the GPA
    gpa = total_points / course_count if course_count > 0 else 0

    return gpa


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    grades = {
        "Math": "A",
        "Science": "B",
        "English": "A",
        "History": "C"
    }

    try:
        gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)
        print(f"GPA: {gpa:.2f}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Generated Output
```
GPA: 3.25
```
