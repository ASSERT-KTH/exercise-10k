# Define a range of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
numbers = range(1, 11)

# Use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers
for number in numbers:
    # Print each number
    print(number)
```

```python
# Use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 10
for number in range(1, 11):
    # Print each number
    print(number)
```
