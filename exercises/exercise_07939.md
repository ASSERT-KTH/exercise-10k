## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the energy given the mass and velocity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_energy(mass, velocity):
    """
    Calculates the energy of an object given its mass and velocity.

    Args:
        mass (float): The mass of the object in kg.
        velocity (float): The velocity of the object in m/s.

    Returns:
        float: The energy of the object in Joules.
    """
    energy = 0.5 * mass * (velocity ** 2)
    return energy

def main():
    mass = float(input("Enter the mass of the object in kg: "))
    velocity = float(input("Enter the velocity of the object in m/s: "))

    energy = calculate_energy(mass, velocity)
    print(f"The energy of the object is {energy} Joules.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the mass of the object in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpgc8kya4z.py", line 23, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpgc8kya4z.py", line 16, in main
    mass = float(input("Enter the mass of the object in kg: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5'
```
