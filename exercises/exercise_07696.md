## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the minimum of two numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_of_two(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Returns the minimum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The minimum of a and b.
    """
    return min(a, b)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10.5
    num2 = 5.2
    print(f"The minimum of {num1} and {num2} is {min_of_two(num1, num2)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The minimum of 10.5 and 5.2 is 5.2
```
