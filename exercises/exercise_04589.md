## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as input and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to that number

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 10
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num}: {fibonacci(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
