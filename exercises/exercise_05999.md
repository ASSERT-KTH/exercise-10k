## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a generator that yields the squares of the numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_generator(numbers):
    """
    This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a generator that yields the squares of the numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Yields:
        int: The square of each number in the input list.
    """

    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in numbers:
        
        # Check if the current item is a number
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("All elements in the list must be numbers")
        
        # Calculate the square of the current number
        square = num ** 2
        
        # Yield the square of the current number
        yield square

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = square_generator(numbers)

# Print the squares of the numbers
for square in squares:
    print(square)
```
