## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to let the user guess a randomly generated number until they guess it correctly.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None
    attempts = 0

    while guess != number_to_guess:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
        
        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        if not guess.isdigit():
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue

        # Convert the input to an integer
        guess = int(guess)

        # Check if the guess is in the correct range
        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
            print("Please guess a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue

        # Increment the attempt counter
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number to guess
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")

    # Print a success message
    print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: Too high!
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmgwj0fn7.py", line 39, in <module>
    guess_number()
  File "/tmp/tmpmgwj0fn7.py", line 11, in guess_number
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
