## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of lists and a mapping function as input and returns a new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def map_and_flatten(list_of_lists, mapping_function):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists and a mapping function as input, 
    applies the mapping function to each element in the sublists, 
    and returns a new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list.

    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list containing sublists.
        mapping_function (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a value.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the mapped and flattened elements
    result = []

    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Iterate over each element in the current sublist
        for element in sublist:
            # Apply the mapping function to the current element and append the result to the result list
            result.append(mapping_function(element))

    # Return the result list
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
double_numbers = map_and_flatten(numbers, lambda x: x * 2)
print(double_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```
