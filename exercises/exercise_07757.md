## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input and outputs a greeting message with the user's name and their age in a specific format. The program should also include input validation to ensure the user's age is within a valid range (1-120 years). If the age is not valid, the program should prompt the user to re-enter their age until a valid age is provided.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import Modules
import sys

# Define Variables
name = ""
age = ""

# Get User's Name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Get User's Age
while True:
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    if age.isdigit() and 1 <= int(age) <= 120:
        age = int(age)
        break
    print("Invalid age. Please enter an integer between 1 and 120.")

# Create Greeting Message
greeting_message = "Hello {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age)

# Print Greeting Message
print(greeting_message)

# Exit Program
sys.exit()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: Hello John Doe! You are 25 years old.
```
