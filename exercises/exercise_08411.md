## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student has passed or failed. The passing grade is 60. If the student's grade is 90 or above, output 'A', between 80 and 89, output 'B', between 70 and 79, output 'C', between 60 and 69, output 'D', and below 60, output 'F'. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the user input
grade = int(input("Enter your grade: "))

# Check if the grade is passing
if grade >= 60:
    print("You passed!")
else:
    print("You failed!")

# Determine the letter grade
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C")
elif grade >= 60:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your grade: You passed!
B
```
