## Exercise
Create a function that returns another function with access to its own scope

## Reference Solution
```python
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    Returns a closure function with access to its own scope.

    Args:
        outer_variable (str): A variable that will be accessible within the closure function.

    Returns:
        function: A closure function with access to the outer function's scope.
    """
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        """
        A closure function with access to the outer function's scope.

        Args:
            inner_variable (str): A variable that will be used within the closure function.

        Returns:
            str: A string that combines the outer and inner variables.
        """
        return f"{outer_variable} {inner_variable}"

    return inner_function

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a closure function with the outer variable "Hello"
    hello_function = outer_function("Hello")

    # Use the closure function with the inner variable "World"
    result = hello_function("World")
    print(result)  # Output: Hello World
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello World
```
