## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to n, and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n, but shifted by the row number. For example, if n is 3, the pattern should be: 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5. The input will be a single integer n.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: To print a pattern of numbers using loops.

n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        print((i + j - 1), end=' ')
    print()
```

## Generated Output
```
1 2 3 
2 3 4 
3 4 5
```
