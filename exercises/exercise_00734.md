## Exercise
Write a program that takes the wholesale price and markup percentage of a product as input and outputs its retail price.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate retail price
def calculate_retail_price(wholesale_price, markup_percentage):
    """
    Calculates the retail price of a product based on the wholesale price and markup percentage.

    Args:
        wholesale_price (float): The wholesale price of the product.
        markup_percentage (float): The markup percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The retail price of the product.
    """
    # Calculate the markup amount
    markup_amount = (wholesale_price / 100) * markup_percentage
    
    # Calculate the retail price
    retail_price = wholesale_price + markup_amount
    
    return retail_price


# Main function
def main():
    # Get the wholesale price and markup percentage from the user
    wholesale_price = float(input("Enter the wholesale price: "))
    markup_percentage = float(input("Enter the markup percentage: "))

    # Calculate the retail price
    retail_price = calculate_retail_price(wholesale_price, markup_percentage)

    # Print the retail price
    print(f"The retail price is: ${retail_price:.2f}")


# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the wholesale price: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8w4rwpry.py", line 37, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp8w4rwpry.py", line 25, in main
    wholesale_price = float(input("Enter the wholesale price: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 20'
```
