## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the tax amount given the income and tax rate.

```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount given the income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income amount.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.

    Returns:
        float: The tax amount.
    """
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount

def main():
    # Get user input
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 25 for 25%): ")) / 100

    # Calculate tax amount
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)

    # Print the result
    print(f"Your tax amount is: ${tax_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
