## Exercise
Develop a program to predict a student's grade based on their attendance and marks. If the attendance is above 90% and the marks are above 80, the grade is A. If the attendance is between 80% and 90% and the marks are between 70 and 80, the grade is B.

## Reference Solution
```python
def predict_grade(attendance, marks):
    """
    Predicts a student's grade based on their attendance and marks.

    Args:
        attendance (float): Student's attendance percentage
        marks (float): Student's marks percentage

    Returns:
        str: Predicted grade
    """
    if attendance > 90 and marks > 80:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= attendance <= 90 and 70 <= marks <= 80:
        return "B"
    else:
        return "C"

def main():
    attendance = float(input("Enter student's attendance percentage: "))
    marks = float(input("Enter student's marks percentage: "))

    grade = predict_grade(attendance, marks)
    print(f"Predicted grade: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter student's attendance percentage: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpnnyxhhdh.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpnnyxhhdh.py", line 20, in main
    attendance = float(input("Enter student's attendance percentage: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '95 85'
