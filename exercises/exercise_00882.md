## Exercise
Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and ask the user for their choice. Then, it should determine the winner based on the game's rules and print out the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Asks the user for their choice and returns it."""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return user_choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors."""
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
    print(f"You chose: {user_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

def main():
    play_again = "yes"
    while play_again.lower() == "yes":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Computer chose: scissors
You chose: rock

You win!
Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
