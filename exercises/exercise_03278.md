## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a bank account, allowing the user to deposit and withdraw money until they choose to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance


def main():
    account = BankAccount()
    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit money")
        print("2. Withdraw money")
        print("3. Check balance")
        print("4. Quit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: $"))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: $"))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}")
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Bank Account Menu:
1. Deposit money

4. Quit
Enter your choice: Invalid choice. Please try again.

Bank Account Menu:
1. Deposit money
2. Withdraw money
3. Check balance
4. Quit
Enter your choice:
