## Exercise
Given a string and a pattern, find all occurrences of the pattern in the string and return their starting indices.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def find_pattern(string, pattern):
    """
    Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string and return their starting indices.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        pattern (str): The pattern to search for.

    Returns:
        list: A list of starting indices of the pattern in the string.
    """
    # Use re.finditer to find all occurrences of the pattern
    matches = re.finditer(pattern, string)
    
    # Extract the starting indices of the matches
    indices = [match.start() for match in matches]
    
    return indices

# Example usage
string = "abababab"
pattern = "ab"
print(find_pattern(string, pattern))  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[0, 2, 4, 6]
```
