## Exercise
Create a program that checks whether a given month number (1-12) is valid and prints out the corresponding month name using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
for month in range(1, 13):
    if month == 1:
        print("January")
    elif month == 2:
        print("February")
    elif month == 3:
        print("March")
    elif month == 4:
        print("April")
    elif month == 5:
        print("May")
    elif month == 6:
        print("June")
    elif month == 7:
        print("July")
    elif month == 8:
        print("August")
    elif month == 9:
        print("September")
    elif month == 10:
        print("October")
    elif month == 11:
        print("November")
    elif month == 12:
        print("December")
    else:
        print("Invalid month")
