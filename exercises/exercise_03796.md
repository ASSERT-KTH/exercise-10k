## Exercise
Write a function that finds the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(coins, amount):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

    Args:
    coins (list): A list of available coin denominations.
    amount (int): The amount for which to make change.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount.
    """
    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make 0 amount

    # Iterate over each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            # Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    # Return the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage:
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11
print(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
3
```
