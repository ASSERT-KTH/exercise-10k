## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True if it is even and False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function called 'is_even' that takes one argument 'num'.
def is_even(num):
    """
    This function checks if a number is even.

    Args:
        num (int): The number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is an integer. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(num, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")

    # Now, we use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of 'num' by 2.
    # If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.
    remainder = num % 2
    
    # We use a conditional statement to return True if the remainder is 0 and False otherwise.
    # This is equivalent to saying: if the remainder is 0, return True; otherwise, return False.
    return remainder == 0
```
