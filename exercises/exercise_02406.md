## Exercise
Create a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to a list of numbers. Then, call this function with a simple arithmetic function and a list of numbers and print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function(func, numbers):
    """
    Applies a given function to each element of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to apply.
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of results after applying the function.
    """
    return [func(num) for num in numbers]


# Example usage
def square(x):
    """
    Returns the square of a number.

    Args:
        x (int): The number to square.

    Returns:
        int: The square of the number.
    """
    return x ** 2


# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the square function to the list of numbers
results = apply_function(square, numbers)

# Print the results
print("Results:")
for num, result in zip(numbers, results):
    print(f"{num} -> {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Results:
1 -> 1
2 -> 4
3 -> 9
4 -> 16
5 -> 25
```
