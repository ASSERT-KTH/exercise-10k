## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.
    """
    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2
    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)

    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM = (num1 * num2) / GCD
    lcm = (num1 * num2) // gcd

    return lcm

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 12
    num2 = 15
    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60
```
