## Exercise
Write a program that declares a complex number variable and prints its real and imaginary parts.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare a complex number variable
complex_number = 3 + 4j

# Print the complex number
print("Complex Number: ", complex_number)

# Print the real part of the complex number
print("Real Part: ", complex_number.real)

# Print the imaginary part of the complex number
print("Imaginary Part: ", complex_number.imag)
```

## Generated Output
```
Complex Number:  (3+4j)
Real Part:  3.0
Imaginary Part:  4.0
```
