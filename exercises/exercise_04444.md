## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a noun, verb, and adjective, and then prints out a silly story using these words.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_input():
    """Gets user input for noun, verb, and adjective."""
    noun = input("Please enter a noun: ")
    verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
    adjective = input("Please enter an adjective: ")
    return noun, verb, adjective

def generate_silly_story(noun, verb, adjective):
    """Generates a silly story using the given words."""
    story = f"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} decided to {verb} across the land. "
    story += f"As it {verb}ed, it encountered many strange creatures, but none as {adjective} as itself. "
    story += f"In the end, the {noun} learned that being {adjective} and {verb}ing was the key to happiness."
    return story

def main():
    """Main function."""
    noun, verb, adjective = get_user_input()
    silly_story = generate_silly_story(noun, verb, adjective)
    print("Here is your silly story:")
    print(silly_story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a noun: Please enter a verb: Please enter an adjective: Here is your silly story:
One day, a very happy cat decided to run across the land. As it runed, it encountered many strange creatures, but none as happy as itself. In the end, the cat learned that being happy and runing was the key to happiness.
