## Exercise
Read a sentence from the user and calculate the frequency of each word

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def calculate_word_frequency(sentence):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of each word in a sentence.

    Args:
        sentence (str): The input sentence.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    # Convert to lower case and remove punctuation
    sentence = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', sentence.lower())
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each word
    frequency = Counter(words)
    
    return frequency

def main():
    # Read a sentence from the user
    sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
    
    # Calculate the word frequency
    frequency = calculate_word_frequency(sentence)
    
    # Print the word frequency
    print("Word Frequency:")
    for word, count in frequency.most_common():
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a sentence: Word Frequency:
