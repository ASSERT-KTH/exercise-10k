## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(amount):
    coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]
    count = 0
    i = 0

    while amount > 0 and i < len(coins):
        if amount >= coins[i]:
            amount -= coins[i]
            count += 1
        else:
            i += 1

    return count

# Test the function
amount = int(input("Enter the amount in cents: "))
print("Minimum number of coins needed:", min_coins(amount))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount in cents: Minimum number of coins needed: 4
```
