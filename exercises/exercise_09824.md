## Exercise
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, utilizing dynamic programming to optimize performance. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the Fibonacci numbers
    fib_dict = {0: 0, 1: 1}

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the ith Fibonacci number using the previously computed numbers
        fib_dict[i] = fib_dict[i - 1] + fib_dict[i - 2]

    # Return the Fibonacci sequence as a list
    return [fib_dict[i] for i in range(n + 1)]


def main():
    # Get the number of terms from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence
    fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)

    # Print the Fibonacci sequence
    print("Fibonacci Sequence:", fib_sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of terms: Fibonacci Sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
```
