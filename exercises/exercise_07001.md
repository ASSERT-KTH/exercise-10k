## Exercise
Write a program that takes the principal amount, rate of interest, and time as input and returns the amount after compounding.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):
    """
    Calculate the amount after compounding.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money.
        rate (float): The rate of interest as a decimal.
        time (float): The time the money is invested for in years.
        n (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        float: The amount after compounding.
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)
    return amount

def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest as a percentage: ")) / 100
    time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))
    n = int(input("Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year (default is 1): ") or 1)

    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)
    print(f"The amount after {time} years is: ${amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_9go1l_1.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_9go1l_1.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
