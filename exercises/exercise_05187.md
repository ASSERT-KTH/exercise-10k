## Exercise
Write a program that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. The program should generate two random numbers between 1 and 6 and print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def roll_dice():
    """
    Simulates rolling two six-sided dice.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the results of the two dice rolls.
    """
    # Generate two random numbers between 1 and 6
    dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)
    dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)
    
    return dice1, dice2

def main():
    # Roll the dice
    result1, result2 = roll_dice()
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"You rolled a {result1} and a {result2}. The total is {result1 + result2}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
You rolled a 3 and a 2. The total is 5.
```
