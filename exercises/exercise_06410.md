## Exercise
Write a program that takes a day of the week as input and prints out the corresponding day of the week. Use if/else statements to determine the day.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_day_of_week(day):
    """Prints the corresponding day of the week based on the input."""
    if day == "monday":
        print("Monday")
    elif day == "tuesday":
        print("Tuesday")
    elif day == "wednesday":
        print("Wednesday")
    elif day == "thursday":
        print("Thursday")
    elif day == "friday":
        print("Friday")
    elif day == "saturday":
        print("Saturday")
    elif day == "sunday":
        print("Sunday")
    else:
        print("Invalid day of the week. Please enter a day between monday and sunday.")

def main():
    day = input("Enter a day of the week (in lowercase): ").lower()
    print_day_of_week(day)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def print_day_of_week(day):
    days = {
        "monday": "Monday",
        "tuesday": "Tuesday",
        "wednesday": "Wednesday",
        "thursday": "Thursday",
        "friday": "Friday",
        "saturday": "Saturday",
        "sunday": "Sunday"
    }
    print(days.get(day.lower(), "Invalid day of the week. Please enter a day between monday and sunday."))

def main():
    day = input("Enter a day of the week (in any case): ")
    print_day_of_week(day)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a day of the week (in lowercase): Monday
```
