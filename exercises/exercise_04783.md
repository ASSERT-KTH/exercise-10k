## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out the number squared.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_number():
    """Get a number from the user."""
    while True:
        try:
            number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
            return number
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number. Try again.")

def square_number(number):
    """Return the square of a number."""
    return number ** 2

def main():
    """Main function."""
    number = get_user_number()
    squared_number = square_number(number)
    print(f"The square of {number} is {squared_number}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
