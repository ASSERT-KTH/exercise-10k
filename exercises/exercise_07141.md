## Exercise
Write a program that prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n, where n is provided as an input. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers and check if each number is even by using the modulus operator.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    sum = 0
    for x in range(1, n+1):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            sum = sum + x
    print("The sum of all even numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
```
