## Exercise
Write a program that generates and prints the first n numbers in a given sequence (e.g. arithmetic, geometric) using for loops.

## Reference Solution
```python
def arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n):
    """
    Generate and print the first n numbers in an arithmetic sequence.

    Args:
        a (int): The first term of the sequence.
        d (int): The common difference of the sequence.
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.
    """
    print("Arithmetic Sequence:")
    for i in range(n):
        term = a + (i * d)
        print(term, end=" ")


def geometric_sequence(a, r, n):
    """
    Generate and print the first n numbers in a geometric sequence.

    Args:
        a (int): The first term of the sequence.
        r (int): The common ratio of the sequence.
        n (int): The number of terms to generate.
    """
    print("Geometric Sequence:")
    for i in range(n):
        term = a * (r ** i)
        print(term, end=" ")


def main():
    # Example usage
    a = 2  # First term
    d = 3  # Common difference
    r = 2  # Common ratio
    n = 10  # Number of terms

    arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n)
    print("\n")
    geometric_sequence(a, r, n)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Arithmetic Sequence:
2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 

Geometric Sequence:
2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
```
