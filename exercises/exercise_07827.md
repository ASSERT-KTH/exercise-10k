## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The function should handle empty lists and lists with duplicate maximum values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_value(lst):
    """
    This function finds the maximum value in a given list of integers.
    
    It handles empty lists by returning None and lists with duplicate maximum values by returning the maximum value.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int or None: The maximum value in the list, or None if the list is empty.
    """

    # First, we check if the list is empty. If it is, we return None as per the problem statement.
    if not lst:
        return None

    # We use the built-in max function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.
    # The max function can handle lists with duplicate maximum values because it will return the first maximum value it encounters.
    # However, since we're using a list of integers, it doesn't matter which maximum value is returned because they're all equal.
    return max(lst)
```
