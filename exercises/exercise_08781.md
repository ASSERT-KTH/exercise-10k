## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the sum
    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_numbers}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpoxg1_4m_.py", line 15, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpoxg1_4m_.py", line 7, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '2 3'
```
