## Exercise
Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two given integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    result = gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6
