## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw or deposit. Use conditional statements to determine if the transaction is possible (e.g., sufficient funds for withdrawal) and update the balance accordingly.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_float_input(prompt):
    """Gets a float input from the user."""
    while True:
        try:
            return float(input(prompt))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

def bank_transaction_system():
    """Simulates a bank transaction system."""
    print("Welcome to the Bank Transaction System")

    # Get the user's current balance
    balance = get_float_input("Enter your current balance: ")

    while True:
        # Ask the user if they want to withdraw or deposit
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Withdraw")
        print("2. Deposit")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): ")

        if choice == "1":
            # Withdrawal
            amount = get_float_input("Enter the amount you want to withdraw: ")
            if amount > balance:
                print("Insufficient funds. Withdrawal not possible.")
            else:
                balance -= amount
                print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {balance:.2f}")

        elif choice == "2":
            # Deposit
            amount = get_float_input("Enter the amount you want to deposit: ")
            balance += amount
            print(f"Deposit successful. New balance: {balance:.2f}")

        elif choice == "3":
            # Check Balance
            print(f"Current balance: {balance:.2f}")

        elif choice == "4":
            # Exit
            print("Thank you for using the Bank Transaction System. Goodbye!")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bank_transaction_system()
```
