## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns two lists: one with the elements that satisfy the condition and one with the elements that do not.

## Reference Solution
```python
def separate_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    This function takes a list and a condition as input, 
    and returns two lists: one with the elements that satisfy the condition 
    and one with the elements that do not.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list to be separated.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements that satisfy the condition, 
        and the second list contains elements that do not.
    """

    # Initialize two empty lists to store the elements that satisfy the condition and those that do not
    satisfied = []
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the elements that do not satisfy the condition
    not_satisfied = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # Check if the condition is met for the current element
        if condition(element):
            # If the condition is met, append the element to the 'satisfied' list
            satisfied.append(element)
        else:
            # If the condition is not met, append the element to the 'not_satisfied' list
            not_satisfied.append(element)

    # Return a tuple containing the 'satisfied' and 'not_satisfied' lists
    return satisfied, not_satisfied

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

even_numbers, odd_numbers = separate_list(numbers, is_even)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd numbers:", odd_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5]
```
