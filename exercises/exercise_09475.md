## Exercise
Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and a grade, then store this information in the dictionary. The program should also have an option to calculate the average grade for a given student.

## Reference Solution
```python
class StudentGrades:
    def __init__(self):
        self.grades = {}

    def add_grade(self):
        """Add a grade for a student"""
        name = input("Enter student's name: ")
        grade = float(input("Enter grade: "))

        if name in self.grades:
            self.grades[name].append(grade)
        else:
            self.grades[name] = [grade]

        print(f"Grade added for {name}")

    def calculate_average(self):
        """Calculate the average grade for a student"""
        name = input("Enter student's name: ")

        if name in self.grades:
            average = sum(self.grades[name]) / len(self.grades[name])
            print(f"The average grade for {name} is {average:.2f}")
        else:
            print(f"No grades found for {name}")

    def display_menu(self):
        """Display the main menu"""
        while True:
            print("\nStudent Grades Program")
            print("1. Add a grade")
            print("2. Calculate average grade")
            print("3. Quit")

            choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

            if choice == "1":
                self.add_grade()
            elif choice == "2":
                self.calculate_average()
            elif choice == "3":
                print("Goodbye!")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


def main():
    grades = StudentGrades()
    grades.display_menu()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
