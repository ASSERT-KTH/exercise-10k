## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and two numbers as input. Use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform and output the result. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, output an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def math_operations(operation, num1, num2):
    if operation == 'addition':
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        if num2 == 0:
            result = 'Error: Division by zero is not allowed'
        else:
            result = num1 / num2
    else:
        result = 'Error: Invalid operation'
    return result

num1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))
num2 = float(input('Enter the second number: '))
operation = input('Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ')

result = math_operations(operation, num1, num2)
print('The result is:', result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9vovywsf.py", line 17, in <module>
    num1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'add 5 3'
```
