## Exercise
Write a function to sort a dictionary by its keys.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_dict_by_keys(input_dict):
    """
    This function sorts a dictionary by its keys.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be sorted.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary sorted by its keys.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a dictionary. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a dictionary.")

    # We use the built-in sorted function to sort the dictionary items based on their keys.
    # The sorted function returns a new list containing all items from the dictionary in ascending order of their keys.
    sorted_items = sorted(input_dict.items())

    # We then use the dict function to convert the sorted list back into a dictionary.
    # In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain the insertion order, so this will result in a sorted dictionary.
    sorted_dict = dict(sorted_items)

    # Finally, we return the sorted dictionary.
    return sorted_dict

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}
sorted_my_dict = sort_dict_by_keys(my_dict)
print(sorted_my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
