## Exercise
Write a program that finds the intersection of two sets and prints the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def intersection(set1, set2):
    """Return the intersection of two sets."""
    return set1 & set2

def main():
    # Define two sets
    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    result = intersection(set1, set2)

    # Print the result
    print("Set 1:", set1)
    print("Set 2:", set2)
    print("Intersection:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Set 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection: {4, 5}
```
