## Exercise
Create a function that uses the filter function to select elements from a list that satisfy a given condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    This function filters elements from a list based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list from which elements are to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns True if the element satisfies the condition, False otherwise.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.
    """

    # We'll use the built-in filter function in Python, which constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True.
    # The filter function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable.
    # We'll pass the condition function and the input list to the filter function.
    filtered_iterator = filter(condition, input_list)

    # The filter function returns an iterator, so we need to convert it to a list if we want to use the result as a list.
    # We can use the list function to convert the iterator to a list.
    filtered_list = list(filtered_iterator)

    # Finally, we return the filtered list.
    return filtered_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
