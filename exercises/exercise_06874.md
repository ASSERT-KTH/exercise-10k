## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote or not (assuming the voting age is 18).

## Reference Solution
```python
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

print("Hello", name + "!")
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

## Generated Output

Please enter your name: Please enter your age: Hello John Doe!
You are eligible to vote.
```
