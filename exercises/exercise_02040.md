## Exercise
Develop a program that determines a customer's loyalty status based on their purchase history and membership status. The program should use if/else statements to determine the customer's loyalty status.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, membership_status, purchase_history):
        """
        Initialize a Customer object.

        Args:
            name (str): The customer's name.
            membership_status (str): The customer's membership status (e.g., "Basic", "Premium", "Elite").
            purchase_history (list): A list of the customer's past purchases.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.membership_status = membership_status
        self.purchase_history = purchase_history

    def determine_loyalty_status(self):
        """
        Determine the customer's loyalty status based on their purchase history and membership status.

        Returns:
            str: The customer's loyalty status (e.g., "New", "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum").
        """
        if self.membership_status == "Basic" and len(self.purchase_history) < 5:
            return "New"
        elif self.membership_status == "Basic" and len(self.purchase_history) >= 5:
            return "Silver"
        elif self.membership_status == "Premium" and len(self.purchase_history) < 10:
            return "Gold"
        elif self.membership_status == "Premium" and len(self.purchase_history) >= 10:
            return "Platinum"
        elif self.membership_status == "Elite":
            return "Platinum"
        else:
            return "Unknown"

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a customer with basic membership and 3 purchases
    customer1 = Customer("John Doe", "Basic", ["Purchase 1", "Purchase 2", "Purchase 3"])
    print(f"{customer1.name}'s loyalty status: {customer1.determine_loyalty_status()}")

    # Create a customer with premium membership and 12 purchases
    customer2 = Customer("Jane Doe", "Premium", ["Purchase 1", "Purchase 2", "Purchase 3", "Purchase 4", "Purchase 5", "Purchase 6", "Purchase 7", "Purchase 8", "Purchase 9", "Purchase 10", "Purchase 11", "Purchase 12"])
    print(f"{customer2.name}'s loyalty status: {customer2.determine_loyalty_status()}")

    # Create a customer with elite membership
    customer3 = Customer("Bob Smith", "Elite", [])
    print(f"{customer3.name}'s loyalty status: {customer3.determine_loyalty_status()}")
```

## Generated Output
```
John Doe's loyalty status: New
Jane Doe's loyalty status: Platinum
Bob Smith's loyalty status: Platinum
```
