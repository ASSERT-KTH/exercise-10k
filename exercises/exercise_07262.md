## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student passed or failed based on a passing grade of 60. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This program determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their grade.

def determine_passing_status(grade):
    if grade >= 60:
        print("You passed!")
    else:
        print("You failed!")

grade = input("Enter your grade: ")
grade = int(grade)

determine_passing_status(grade)
```

```python
while True:
    try:
        grade = int(input("Enter your grade: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your grade: You passed!
```
