## Exercise
Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years as input and outputs the compound interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money.
        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 4% = 0.04).
        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for.

    Returns:
        float: The compound interest.
    """
    return principal * ((1 + rate) ** years - 1)


def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years)
    print(f"The compound interest is: {compound_interest:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_jk_pisp.py", line 26, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp_jk_pisp.py", line 17, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 10'
```
