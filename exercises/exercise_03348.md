## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize the first two terms
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 2

    # Print the first two terms
    print(a)
    print(b)

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence
    while count < n:
        # Calculate the next term
        next_term = a + b
        print(next_term)
        
        # Update a and b for the next iteration
        a, b = b, next_term
        count += 1

# Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term
fibonacci(10)
```

## Generated Output
```
