## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a student's score and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.
    
    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.
    
    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    
    # Check if the score is within the range of A (90-100)
    if 90 <= score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    
    # Check if the score is within the range of B (80-89)
    elif 80 <= score < 90:
        return 'B'
    
    # Check if the score is within the range of C (70-79)
    elif 70 <= score < 80:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if the score is within the range of D (60-69)
    elif 60 <= score < 70:
        return 'D'
    
    # If the score is below 60, the grade is F
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    
    # Ensure the score is within the valid range (0-100)
    while score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
    
    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
