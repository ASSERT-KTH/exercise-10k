## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the same elements in sorted order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_list(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list as input, sorts its elements in ascending order, 
    and returns the sorted list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list of elements to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the same elements in sorted order.
    """
    return sorted(input_list)

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
