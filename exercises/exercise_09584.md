## Exercise
Write a program that rotates an array to the right by a specified number of positions. The program should take two inputs: the array and the number of positions to rotate. The rotation should be done in-place, meaning that the original array should be modified.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_array(nums, k):
    k %= len(nums)
    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
rotate_array(nums, k)
print(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Generated Output
```
[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
