## Exercise
Create a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI (body mass index) and classifies them as 'underweight', 'normal', 'overweight', or 'obese' based on the following criteria: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal (18.5 <= BMI < 25), overweight (25 <= BMI < 30), obese (BMI >= 30) using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate BMI and classify a person
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    # Calculate BMI
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

    # Classify the person based on their BMI
    if bmi < 18.5:
        classification = "underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
        classification = "normal"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
        classification = "overweight"
    else:
        classification = "obese"

    # Print the result
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f} and you are {classification}.")

# Take user input
def main():
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
    height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

    # Call the function
    calculate_bmi(weight, height)

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp4kq9gwtb.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp4kq9gwtb.py", line 21, in main
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '70 1.75'
