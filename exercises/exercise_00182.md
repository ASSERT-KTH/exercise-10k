## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess a secret number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_secret_number():
    """Generate a secret number between 1 and 100."""
    return random.randint(1, 100)

def get_user_guess():
    """Get the user's guess and validate it."""
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess the secret number: "))
            if 1 <= guess <= 100:
                return guess
            else:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def main():
    secret_number = get_secret_number()
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        user_guess = get_user_guess()
        attempts += 1

        if user_guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess the secret number: Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.
Guess the secret number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp_qjov3de.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()

    user_guess = get_user_guess()
  File "/tmp/tmp_qjov3de.py", line 11, in get_user_guess
    guess = int(input("Guess the secret number: "))
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
