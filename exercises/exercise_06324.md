## Exercise
Write a function that takes two lists as input, concatenates them, and returns the resulting list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def concatenate_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    This function takes two lists as input, concatenates them, and returns the resulting list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list to be concatenated.
        list2 (list): The second list to be concatenated.

    Returns:
        list: A new list that is the result of concatenating list1 and list2.
    """

    # First, we check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be lists.")

    # Now, we can use the + operator to concatenate the two lists. This operator returns a new list that contains all elements from both lists.
    # We assign this new list to the result variable.
    result = list1 + list2

    # Finally, we return the result.
    return result
```
