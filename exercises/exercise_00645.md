## Exercise
Write a program that reads a decimal number from the user and prints out its binary representation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def decimal_to_binary():
    decimal_num = int(input("Enter a decimal number: "))
    binary_num = bin(decimal_num)[2:]  # Remove '0b' prefix
    print(f"The binary representation of {decimal_num} is: {binary_num}")

decimal_to_binary()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a decimal number: The binary representation of 10 is: 1010
```
