## Exercise
Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not using a for loop to check all years up to n.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_leap_year(year):
    """Checks whether a given year is a leap year or not."""
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

def check_leap_years_up_to_n(n):
    """Checks whether each year up to n is a leap year or not using a for loop."""
    for year in range(1, n + 1):
        if check_leap_year(year):
            print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(f"Checking leap years up to {n}:")
check_leap_years_up_to_n(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
Checking leap years up to 10:
1 is not a leap year.
2 is not a leap year.
3 is not a leap year.
4 is a leap year.
5 is not a leap year.
6 is not a leap year.
7 is not a leap year.
8 is a leap year.
9 is not a leap year.
10 is not a leap year.
```
