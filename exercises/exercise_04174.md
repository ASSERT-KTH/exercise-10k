## Exercise
Write a program that takes a month and year as input and prints the calendar for that month.

## Reference Solution
```python
import calendar

def print_monthly_calendar(year, month):
    # Print the calendar for the given month and year
    print(calendar.month(year, month))

def main():
    # Get the month and year from the user
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month (1-12): "))

    # Validate the month
    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        print("Invalid month. Please enter a value between 1 and 12.")
    else:
        print_monthly_calendar(year, month)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the year: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpkaf8981d.py", line 19, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpkaf8981d.py", line 9, in main
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'January 2022'
```
