    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number! Try again.")

    # Check if the number is even or odd
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"The number {num} is even.")
    else:
        print(f"The number {num} is odd.")

def main():
    check_even_or_odd()
