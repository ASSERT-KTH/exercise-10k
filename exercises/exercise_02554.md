## Exercise
Use memoization to optimize a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n, memo={}):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using memoization.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
        memo (dict, optional): A dictionary to store the memoized results. Defaults to {}.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Check if the result is already memoized
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Calculate the factorial and store it in the memo dictionary
    result = n * factorial(n-1, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
