## Exercise
Create a program that calculates student grades based on their scores in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should define a function to calculate the average score and another function to determine the grade based on the average score. The grade scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to get subject scores
def get_subject_score(subject):
    while True:
        score = input(f"Enter your {subject} score: ")
        if score.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
            score = float(score)
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                return score
            else:
                print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

# Define a function to get average score
def get_average_score(math, science, english):
    return (math + science + english) / 3

# Define a function to get grade
def get_grade(average_score):
    if 90 <= average_score <= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 <= average_score < 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 <= average_score < 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 <= average_score < 70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Main program
def main():
    math_score = get_subject_score("Math")
    science_score = get_subject_score("Science")
    english_score = get_subject_score("English")
    
    average_score = get_average_score(math_score, science_score, english_score)
    
    grade = get_grade(average_score)
    
    print(f"Your Math score is: {math_score}")
    print(f"Your Science score is: {science_score}")
    print(f"Your English score is: {english_score}")
    print(f"Your average score is: {average_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

# Call the main program
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your Math score: Invalid input. Please enter a number.
Enter your Math score:
