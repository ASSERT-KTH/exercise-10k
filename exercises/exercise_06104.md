## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing the same integers in sorted order.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_integers(integers):
    """
    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order.

    Args:
        integers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the same integers in sorted order.
    """
    return sorted(integers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = sort_integers(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
