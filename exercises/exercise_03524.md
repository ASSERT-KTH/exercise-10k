    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.
    """
    index = 0
    total = 0
    while index < len(numbers):
        total += numbers[index]
        index += 1
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

## Generated Output
