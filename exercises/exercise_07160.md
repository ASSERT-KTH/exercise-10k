## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, you must be at least 18 years old to vote.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility(age):
    """
    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

    Args:
        age (int): The age of the person.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.
    """
    return age >= 18

def main():
    # Ask for the person's age
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")

    # Check if the person is eligible to vote
    if check_voting_eligibility(age):
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
