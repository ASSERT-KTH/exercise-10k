## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade. The grade is determined by the following rules: score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'. Use conditional statements to implement this logic.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Problem Statement
# Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade.
# The grade is determined by the following rules:
# score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'.

# Importing Modules
import sys

# Defining Variables
score = 75

# Conditional Statements
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

# Running the Program
# To run the program, save it to a file (e.g., grade_calculator.py) and run it using Python (e.g., python grade_calculator.py).
```

## Generated Output
```
Grade: C
```
