## Exercise
Write a program that implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted list. Use a while loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n = 16;
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16};
    int key = 13;
    int low, high, mid;
    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (key == a[mid]) {
            cout << "Target value " << key << " found at index " << mid << endl;
            return 0;
        } else if (key < a[mid]) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    cout << "Target value " << key << " not found in the list." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
