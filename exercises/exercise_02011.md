## Exercise
Write a program that takes a news headline as input and classifies it as either positive, negative, or neutral using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def classify_headline(headline):
    """
    Classify a news headline as positive, negative, or neutral.
    
    Args:
    headline (str): The news headline to be classified.
    
    Returns:
    str: The classification of the headline (positive, negative, or neutral).
    """
    
    # Convert the headline to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    headline = headline.lower()
    
    # Define lists of positive and negative words
    positive_words = ["wins", "success", "great", "good", "up"]
    negative_words = ["loss", "fail", "bad", "down", "decrease"]
    
    # Initialize a score for the headline
    score = 0
    
    # Check for positive words in the headline
    for word in positive_words:
        if word in headline:
            score += 1
    
    # Check for negative words in the headline
    for word in negative_words:
        if word in headline:
            score -= 1
    
    # Classify the headline based on the score
    if score > 0:
        return "positive"
    elif score < 0:
        return "negative"
    else:
        return "neutral"

# Test the function with some examples
headlines = [
    "Company Wins Big Contract",
    "Stock Prices Fall",
    "New Product Launch is Successful",
    "Economic Growth is Down",
    "No Change in Market Trends"
]

for headline in headlines:
    print(f"Headline: {headline}, Classification: {classify_headline(headline)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Headline: Company Wins Big Contract, Classification: positive
Headline: Stock Prices Fall, Classification: neutral
Headline: New Product Launch is Successful, Classification: positive
Headline: Economic Growth is Down, Classification: negative
Headline: No Change in Market Trends, Classification: neutral
```
