## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
total = 0

# Loop through each number in the list
for number in numbers:
    # Add the current number to the total
    total += number

# Calculate the average
average = total / len(numbers)

# Print the average
print("The average is:", average)
```

```python
if len(numbers) == 0:
    print("The list is empty")
else:
    average = total / len(numbers)
    print("The average is:", average)
```

## Generated Output
```
The average is: 3.0
```
