## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list and two indices as input, and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second index.

## Reference Solution
```python
def slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):
    """
    This function takes a list and two indices as input, 
    and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second index.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list to be sliced.
        start_index (int): The starting index of the slice.
        end_index (int): The ending index of the slice.

    Returns:
        list: A slice of the input list from the start_index to the end_index.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(input_list, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Then, we need to check if the start and end indices are integers
    if not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):
        raise TypeError("Start and end indices must be integers")

    # Next, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index
    if start_index > end_index:
        raise ValueError("Start index cannot be greater than end index")

    # Now, we need to check if the start and end indices are within the bounds of the list
    if start_index < 0 or end_index > len(input_list):
        raise IndexError("Index out of range")

    # Finally, we can return the slice of the list using Python's list slicing feature
    # The slicing operation will include all elements from the start index up to but not including the end index
    return input_list[start_index:end_index]
```
