## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_keys(dictionary):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
        list: A list of all the keys in the dictionary.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a dictionary")

    # Since dictionaries have a built-in method to return a view object that displays a list of all the keys available in the dictionary, 
    # we can directly use this method to get the keys
    # The keys() method returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys available in the dictionary
    keys = dictionary.keys()

    # We then convert this view object into a list, because the problem statement asks for a list
    # The list() function is used to convert an iterable into a list
    keys_list = list(keys)

    # Finally, we return the list of keys
    return keys_list

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(get_keys(my_dict))  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## Generated Output
```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```
