## Exercise
Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given year is a leap year.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)


def main():
    # Example usage
    years = [1999, 2000, 2004, 2100]
    for year in years:
        if is_leap_year(year):
            print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
1999 is not a leap year.
2000 is a leap year.
2004 is a leap year.
2100 is not a leap year.
```
