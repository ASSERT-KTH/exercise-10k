## Exercise
Write a program that converts a grade from a percentage to a letter grade. If the percentage is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the percentage is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the percentage is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the percentage is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the percentage is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def convert_percentage_to_grade(percentage):
    """
    Converts a percentage to a letter grade.
    
    Args:
        percentage (float): A percentage between 0 and 100.
    
    Returns:
        str: The corresponding letter grade.
    """
    if percentage < 0 or percentage > 100:
        raise ValueError("Percentage must be between 0 and 100.")
    
    if percentage >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif 80 <= percentage < 90:
        return 'B'
    elif 70 <= percentage < 80:
        return 'C'
    elif 60 <= percentage < 70:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Example usage:
    percentages = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]
    for percentage in percentages:
        grade = convert_percentage_to_grade(percentage)
        print(f"{percentage}% is equivalent to {grade}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
95% is equivalent to A.
85% is equivalent to B.
75% is equivalent to C.
65% is equivalent to D.
55% is equivalent to F.
```
