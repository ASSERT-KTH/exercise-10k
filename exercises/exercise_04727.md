## Exercise
Create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two input functions.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose_functions(func1, func2):
    """
    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function 
    that is the composition of the two input functions.

    Args:
        func1 (function): The first function to be composed.
        func2 (function): The second function to be composed.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.
    """

    # We want to return a new function, so we define it inside our compose_functions function
    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):
        
        # First, we call func2 with the provided arguments and keyword arguments
        # The result of this function call will be used as the input for func1
        result_from_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Then, we call func1 with the result from func2 as its input
        # This is the actual composition of the two functions
        result_from_func1 = func1(result_from_func2)
        
        # Finally, we return the result from func1
        return result_from_func1
    
    # We return the composed function
    return composed_function

# Example usage:
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def multiply_by_two(x):
    return x * 2

composed = compose_functions(multiply_by_two, add_one)
print(composed(5))  # Output: 12
```

## Generated Output
```
12
```
