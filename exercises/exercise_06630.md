## Exercise
Create a function that uses generators to produce a sequence of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(start, end, step=1):
    """
    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.
        end (int): The ending number of the sequence.
        step (int, optional): The difference between each number in the sequence. Defaults to 1.

    Yields:
        int: The next number in the sequence.
    """
    current = start
    while current <= end:
        yield current
        current += step


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Generating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 1:")
    for num in generate_sequence(1, 10):
        print(num)

    print("\nGenerating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 2:")
    for num in generate_sequence(1, 10, step=2):
        print(num)
```

## Generated Output
```
Generating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 1:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

Generating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 2:
1
3
