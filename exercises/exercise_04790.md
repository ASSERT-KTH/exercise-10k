## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of rock paper scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    elif user_score < computer_score:
        print("\nComputer wins the series!")
    else:
        print("\nThe series is a tie!")

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    while True:
        print("\n1. Play a single game")
