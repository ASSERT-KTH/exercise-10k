## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the time based on the hours, minutes, and seconds provided by the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_time(hours, minutes, seconds):
    """
    Calculate the time in seconds.

    Args:
        hours (int): The number of hours.
        minutes (int): The number of minutes.
        seconds (int): The number of seconds.

    Returns:
        int: The total time in seconds.
    """
    total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
    return total_seconds

def main():
    # Get user input
    hours = int(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
    minutes = int(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))
    seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))

    # Calculate the time
    total_seconds = calculate_time(hours, minutes, seconds)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The total time is: {total_seconds} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the number of hours: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpod9nw9d0.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpod9nw9d0.py", line 18, in main
    hours = int(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 30 45'
```
