## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

# Initialize the number of attempts
attempts = 0

while True:
    # Ask the user for their guess
    user_guess = input("Guess the number (or 'q' to quit): ")

    # Check if the user wants to quit
    if user_guess.lower() == 'q':
        print("Okay, goodbye!")
        break

    # Convert the user's guess to an integer
    try:
        user_guess = int(user_guess)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter a whole number.")
        continue

    # Check if the user's guess is valid
    if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
        continue

    # Increment the number of attempts
    attempts += 1

    # Check if the user's guess is correct
    if user_guess == number_to_guess:
        print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
        break
    elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
        print("Too low! Try a higher number.")
    else:
        print("Too high! Try a lower number.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess the number (or 'q' to quit): Too high! Try a lower number.
Guess the number (or 'q' to quit): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpyb0877fx.py", line 11, in <module>
    user_guess = input("Guess the number (or 'q' to quit): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
