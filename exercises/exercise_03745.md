## Exercise
Write a program to find the minimum number in a list of integers using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_minimum(numbers):
    """
    This function finds the minimum number in a list of integers.
    
    Parameters:
    numbers (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number in the list.
    """
    
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("The list is empty")
    
    # Initialize the minimum number with the first number in the list
    min_num = numbers[0]
    
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # If the current number is smaller than the minimum number, update the minimum number
        if num < min_num:
            min_num = num
    
    # Return the minimum number
    return min_num

# Example usage:
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]
min_number = find_minimum(numbers)
print("The minimum number is:", min_number)
```

## Generated Output
```
The minimum number is: 1
```
