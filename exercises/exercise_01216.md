## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the product of all elements in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_product(lst):
    """
    This function calculates the product of all elements in a given list.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The product of all elements in the list.
    """

    # Initialize the product variable to 1, which is the multiplicative identity.
    # This will be used to store the product of all elements in the list.
    product = 1

    # Iterate over each element in the list.
    for num in lst:
        # Multiply the current product by the current number in the list.
        # This will effectively calculate the product of all elements in the list.
        product *= num

    # Return the final product.
    return product

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_product(numbers))  # Output: 120
```

## Generated Output
```
120
```
