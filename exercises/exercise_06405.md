## Exercise
Write a program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. Use if/else statements to determine the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 != 0:
        return False
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if is_leap_year(year):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
