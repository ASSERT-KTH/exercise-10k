## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the operation and prints the result. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, print an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(num1, num2, operation):
    """Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers."""
    if operation == 'addition':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtraction':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiplication':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'division':
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")

def main():
    """Gets user input and performs the calculation."""
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ")

    try:
        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)
        print(f"The result of {operation} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmhc5b6en.py", line 29, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpmhc5b6en.py", line 18, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 + 5'
```
