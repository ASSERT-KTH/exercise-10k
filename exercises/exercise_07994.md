## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the Cartesian product of two lists of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import itertools

def cartesian_product(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the Cartesian product of two lists of numbers.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.
        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is a pair of numbers from list1 and list2.
    """
    return list(itertools.product(list1, list2))

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

result = cartesian_product(list1, list2)
print("Cartesian product:")
for pair in result:
    print(pair)
```

## Generated Output
```
Cartesian product:
(1, 4)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
(2, 4)
(2, 5)
(2, 6)
(3, 4)
(3, 5)
(3, 6)
```
