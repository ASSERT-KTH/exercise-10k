## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: Determine if a given year is a leap year

def is_leap(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

# Main program
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if is_leap(year):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
