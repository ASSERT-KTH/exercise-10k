## Exercise
Write a program that takes a user's email as input, checks if it's valid, and prints out a success message if it is.

import re

def validate_email(email):
    """
    Validate an email address.

    Args:
        email (str): The email address to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    email_regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    if re.match(email_regex, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    email = input("Please enter your email address: ")
    if validate_email(email):
        print("Success: Your email address is valid.")
    else:
        print("Error: Your email address is not valid.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
