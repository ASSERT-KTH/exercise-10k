## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the tip given the total bill and tip percentage. The program should use the formula tip = bill * percentage to calculate the tip.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tip(bill, percentage):
    """
    Calculate the tip given the total bill and tip percentage.

    Args:
        bill (float): The total bill amount.
        percentage (float): The tip percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tip amount.
    """
    # Convert percentage to decimal
    decimal_percentage = percentage / 100

    # Calculate the tip using the formula tip = bill * percentage
    tip = bill * decimal_percentage

    return tip


def main():
    # Get the total bill amount from the user
    bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: "))

    # Get the tip percentage from the user
    percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage: "))

    # Calculate the tip
    tip = calculate_tip(bill, percentage)

    # Print the calculated tip
    print(f"The calculated tip is: ${tip:.2f}")

    # Print the total amount including the tip
    total_amount = bill + tip
    print(f"The total amount including the tip is: ${total_amount:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the total bill amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6prjamax.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp6prjamax.py", line 23, in main
    bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '100 15'
