## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount using coins of different denominations.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1


# Test the function
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11
result = min_coins(coins, amount)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Minimum number of coins required to make {amount} is {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Cannot make {amount} with the given coins.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Minimum number of coins required to make 11 is 3.
```
