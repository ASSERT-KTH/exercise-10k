## Exercise
Write a program that takes a string, a character to replace, and a replacement character as input and returns the string with all occurrences of the character replaced.

## Reference Solution
```python
def replaceChar(s, a, b):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return ''
    elif s[0] == a:
        return b + replaceChar(s[1:], a, b)
    else:
        return s[0] + replaceChar(s[1:], a, b)

# Example usage:
s = 'abxyab'
a = 'a'
b = 'b'
print(replaceChar(s, a, b))
```

## Generated Output
```
bbxybb
```
