## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score using if/else statement

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    score = float(input("Enter the score: "))

    # Validate the score
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
    else:
        # Calculate the grade
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"The grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
