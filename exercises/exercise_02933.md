## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Get the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner of the game"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    play_again = "yes"
    while play_again.lower() == "yes":
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
You chose rock, computer chose scissors.
You win!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpyr677uv0.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpyr677uv0.py", line 29, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
