## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input, then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. Finally, it should print out the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def area(x, y):
    return x * y

# Function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
def perimetro(x, y):
    return 2 * (x + y)

# Main part of the program
x = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
y = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area and perimeter
a = area(x, y)
p = perimetro(x, y)

# Print the results
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {a}")
print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {p}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp8npnf68j.py", line 10, in <module>
    x = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10 5'
```
