## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def filter_list(lst, condition):
    """
    Returns a new list containing only the elements from lst that satisfy the condition.

    :param lst: The input list.
    :param condition: A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    :return: A new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.
    """
    new_list = []
    for element in lst:
        if condition(element):
            new_list.append(element)
    return new_list

# Example usage:
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = filter_list(lst, is_even)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6]
```
