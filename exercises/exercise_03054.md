## Exercise
Create a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is less than 0.
    """

    # Check if n is less than 0
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
