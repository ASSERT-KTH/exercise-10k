## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate games of Rock-Paper-Scissors until the user chooses to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the game."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'user'
    return 'computer'

def main():
    play_again = 'y'
    user_wins = 0
    computer_wins = 0
    ties = 0

    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ")

        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")

        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'tie':
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
            ties += 1
        elif winner == 'user':
            print(f"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win this round.")
            user_wins += 1
        else:
            print(f"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins this round.")
            computer_wins += 1

        print(f"\nScore - You: {user_wins}, Computer: {computer_wins}, Ties: {ties}")
        play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")

    print("\nThanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): 
Computer chose: paper
Paper beats rock! Computer wins this round.

Score - You: 0, Computer: 1, Ties: 0

Play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqdmn6258.py", line 49, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqdmn6258.py", line 44, in main
    play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
