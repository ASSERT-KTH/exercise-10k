## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_lcm(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a while loop.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The LCM of the two numbers.
    """
    # Initialize the LCM to the maximum of the two numbers
    lcm = max(num1, num2)

    # Continue to increment the LCM until it is divisible by both numbers
    while True:
        if lcm % num1 == 0 and lcm % num2 == 0:
            break
        lcm += 1

    return lcm

# Example usage
num1 = 12
num2 = 15
lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60
```
