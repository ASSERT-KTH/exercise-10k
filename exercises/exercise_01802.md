## Exercise
Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score, using conditional statements to determine the grade level

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.

    Args:
        score (float): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The grade level.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    """
    Main function to get the score from the user and display the grade.
    """
    score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))

    # Validate the score
    while score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))

    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is: B
```
