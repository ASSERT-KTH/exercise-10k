## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# Purpose: Calculate the power of a number

def power(base, exponent):
    """
    Calculate the power of a number.

    Args:
        base (float): The base number.
        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.

    Returns:
        float: The result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.
    """
    result = base ** exponent
    return result

# Test the function
print(power(2, 3))  # Output: 8
print(power(2, 4))  # Output: 16
print(power(2, 5))  # Output: 32
```

## Generated Output
```
8
16
32
```
