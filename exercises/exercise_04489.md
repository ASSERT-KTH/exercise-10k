## Exercise
Create a function that simulates a bank account. The function allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.

        Args:
            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount cannot be negative")
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the current balance.
        """
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount cannot be negative")
        elif amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Returns the current balance of the account.

        Returns:
            float: The current balance.
        """
        return self.balance


def main():
    # Create a new bank account with an initial balance of $1000
    account = BankAccount(1000)

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Simulator")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
            print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}")
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
            try:
                account.withdraw(amount)
                print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        elif choice == "3":
            print(f"Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}")
        elif choice == "4":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
