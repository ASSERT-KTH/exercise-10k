## Exercise
Write a program to find the maximum gap between two elements in a given sorted list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def maximum_gap(nums):
    """
    Finds the maximum gap between two elements in a given sorted list of integers.

    Args:
        nums (list): A sorted list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum gap between two elements.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements.
    """
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements.")

    max_gap = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        gap = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        if gap > max_gap:
            max_gap = gap

    return max_gap


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [1, 3, 5, 10, 15]
    max_gap = maximum_gap(nums)
    print("Maximum gap:", max_gap)
```

## Generated Output
```
Maximum gap: 5
```
