## Exercise
Write a program that implements a simple game using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        # Get the player's guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")

        # Check if the input is a valid integer
        if user_guess.isdigit():
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue

        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low. Try again!")
        else:
            print("Too high. Try again!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.
Take a guess:
