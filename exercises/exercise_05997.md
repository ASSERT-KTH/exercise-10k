## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as input and returns the factorial of that number using recursion

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example usage:
def main():
    num = 5
    try:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
