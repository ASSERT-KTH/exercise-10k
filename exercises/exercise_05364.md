## Exercise
Write a program to create a new list using list comprehension.

## Reference Solution
```python
def square_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a new list with squared values of the input list.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list with squared values.
    """
    squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
    return squared_numbers

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)

print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
