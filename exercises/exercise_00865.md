## Exercise
Create a program that takes in a password and outputs whether it is valid or not based on the following conditions: a password is valid if it is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def validate_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates a password based on the given conditions.

    Args:
    password (str): The password to validate.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
    if not re.search(r"[A-Z]", password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter
    if not re.search(r"[a-z]", password):
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one digit
    if not re.search(r"\d", password):
        return False

    # If all conditions are met, the password is valid
    return True

def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    if validate_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: The password is valid.
```
