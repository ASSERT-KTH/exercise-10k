## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a student passed or failed based on their grade. The program should ask for the student's grade and then print 'Passed' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Failed' if the grade is below 50.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_grade():
    # Ask for the student's grade
    while True:
        try:
            grade = float(input("Please enter the student's grade: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Check if the grade is 50 or above
    if grade >= 50:
        print('Passed')
    else:
        print('Failed')

# Call the function
check_grade()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the student's grade: Failed
```
