## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and determines whether the student has passed or failed based on a conditional statement. The passing grade is 50. If the student's grade is 50 or above, print 'Passed'. If the grade is below 50, print 'Failed'. Additionally, if the grade is exactly 50, print 'Borderline pass'.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int grade;
    cin >> grade;

    if (grade < 50) {
        cout << "Failed" << endl;
    } else if (grade > 50) {
        cout << "Passed" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Borderline pass" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
