## Exercise
Write a program that checks whether a given password meets certain criteria, such as length and character composition, using conditional statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password(password):
    """
    Checks if a password meets the following criteria:
    - Minimum length of 8 characters
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one digit
    - At least one special character
    """
    errors = []

    # Check length
    if len(password) < 8:
        errors.append("Password should be at least 8 characters long.")

    # Check for uppercase letter
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should have at least one uppercase letter.")

    # Check for lowercase letter
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should have at least one lowercase letter.")

    # Check for digit
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should have at least one digit.")

    # Check for special character
    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):
        errors.append("Password should have at least one special character.")

    if errors:
        return False, errors
    else:
        return True, []

def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    is_valid, errors = check_password(password)

    if is_valid:
        print("Password is valid.")
    else:
        print("Password is not valid. The following errors were found:")
        for error in errors:
            print(error)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: Password is valid.
```
