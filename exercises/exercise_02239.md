## Exercise
Write a program that finds the symmetric difference between two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Calculate the symmetric difference between two arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): The first input array.
        arr2 (list): The second input array.

    Returns:
        list: The symmetric difference between the two input arrays.
    """
    return list(set(arr1) ^ set(arr2))

def main():
    # Example usage:
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

    result = symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2)
    print("Symmetric difference:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Symmetric difference: [1, 2, 5, 6]
```
