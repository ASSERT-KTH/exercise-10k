## Exercise
Write a function to use the get() method to access a value from a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def access_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """
    Access a value from a dictionary using the get() method.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.
        key: The key to look up in the dictionary.

    Returns:
        The value associated with the key, or None if the key is not found.
    """
    return dictionary.get(key)

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(access_dict_value(my_dict, "name"))  # Output: John
print(access_dict_value(my_dict, "city"))  # Output: None

# Providing a default value
print(access_dict_value(my_dict, "city", "New York"))  # Output: New York
```

## Generated Output
```
John
None

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmwe_btkq.py", line 20, in <module>
    print(access_dict_value(my_dict, "city", "New York"))  # Output: New York
TypeError: access_dict_value() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```
