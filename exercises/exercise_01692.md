## Exercise
Write a function to find the most frequent element in a list.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def most_frequent_element(lst):
    """

    Args:

    Returns:
        list: A list of the most frequent elements.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(lst)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())

    # Return all elements with the maximum frequency
    return [elem for elem, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    print(most_frequent_element(lst))  # Output: [4]
```

## Generated Output
