## Exercise
Write a function to find the least frequent character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def least_frequent_char(s):
    """
    Find the least frequent character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The least frequent character.
    """
    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()

    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_count = Counter(s)

    # Find the character with the minimum frequency
    least_frequent = min(char_count, key=char_count.get)

    return least_frequent

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "Hello, World!"
    print(f"The least frequent character in '{s}' is '{least_frequent_char(s)}'")
```

## Generated Output
```
The least frequent character in 'Hello, World!' is 'h'
```
