## Exercise
Write a program that takes a grade as input and checks if it's passing or failing using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to check the grade
def check_grade(grade):
    # Check if the grade is passing (>= 60)
    if grade >= 60:
        print("The grade is passing.")
    # Check if the grade is failing (< 60)
    else:
        print("The grade is failing.")

# Take the grade as input from the user
grade = float(input("Enter a grade: "))

# Check the grade
check_grade(grade)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a grade: The grade is passing.
```
