## Exercise
Write a function to filter a list of integers and return a new list containing only the numbers greater than a specified threshold.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(num_list, threshold):
    """
    This function filters a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the numbers greater than a specified threshold.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of integers to be filtered.
        threshold (int): The threshold value to filter the numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the numbers greater than the threshold.
    """

    # First, we check if the input list is indeed a list and the threshold is an integer
    if not isinstance(num_list, list) or not isinstance(threshold, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list and threshold must be an integer.")

    # Then, we initialize an empty list to store the filtered numbers
    filtered_list = []

    # We iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in num_list:
        # For each number, we check if it is an integer and if it is greater than the threshold
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > threshold:
            # If the number is greater than the threshold, we append it to the filtered list
            filtered_list.append(num)

    # Finally, we return the filtered list
    return filtered_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
threshold_value = 5
print(filter_numbers(numbers, threshold_value))  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
