    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()

    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_count = Counter(s)

    # Find the character with the highest frequency
    most_frequent = char_count.most_common(1)[0][0]

    return most_frequent

# Example usage:
def main():
    s = "Hello, World!"
    print("Most frequent character:", most_frequent_char(s))
