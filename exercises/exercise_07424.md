## Exercise
Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if the input is 'hello', the function should return 'olleh'. The function should be case sensitive and should not remove any characters from the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_string(input_str):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
    
    The function is case sensitive and does not remove any characters from the string.
    
    Parameters:
    input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.
    
    Returns:
    str: The reversed string.
    """
    
    # We start by checking if the input is indeed a string
    if not isinstance(input_str, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string.")
    
    # Since strings in Python are immutable, we can't reverse them in place
    # However, we can use slicing to create a new string that is the reverse of the original
    # The syntax [::-1] means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1
    reversed_str = input_str[::-1]
    
    # Now we simply return the reversed string
    return reversed_str

# Test the function
print(reverse_string('hello'))  # Output: olleh
```

## Generated Output
```
olleh
```
