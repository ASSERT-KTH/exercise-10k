## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all single quotes removed.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_single_quotes(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the string with all single quotes removed.

    Parameters:
    input_string (str): The input string from which single quotes are to be removed.

    Returns:
    str: The input string with all single quotes removed.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is indeed a string. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(input_string, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string.")

    # We use the replace method of the string class in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring.
    # In this case, we replace all occurrences of "'" (single quote) with "" (empty string), effectively removing them.
    # The result is stored in the variable 'result'.
    result = input_string.replace("'", "")

    # Finally, we return the result, which is the input string with all single quotes removed.
    return result
```
