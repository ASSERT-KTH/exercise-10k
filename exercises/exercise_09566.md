## Exercise
Write a program that takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input. If the input can be converted to an integer, it should be stored as an integer. If it can be converted to a float, it should be stored as a float. Otherwise, it should be stored as a string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_data_type(user_input):
    """
    This function determines the data type of the user's input.
    It checks if the input can be converted to an integer or a float, 
    and stores it accordingly. If it cannot be converted to either, 
    it is stored as a string.

    Args:
        user_input (str): The user's input.

    Returns:
        The user's input in its determined data type.
    """

    # First, we try to convert the input to an integer
    try:
        # If the input can be converted to an integer, we return it as an integer
        return int(user_input)
    except ValueError:
        # If the input cannot be converted to an integer, we try to convert it to a float
        try:
            # If the input can be converted to a float, we return it as a float
            return float(user_input)
        except ValueError:
            # If the input cannot be converted to a float, we return it as a string
            return user_input


def main():
    # We ask the user for their input
    user_input = input("Please enter something: ")

    # We determine the data type of the user's input
    result = determine_data_type(user_input)

    # We print the result and its type
    print(f"The input '{user_input}' is of type {type(result).__name__} and has a value of {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter something: The input '123' is of type int and has a value of 123
```
