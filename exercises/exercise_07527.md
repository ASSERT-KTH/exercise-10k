## Exercise
Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The program should calculate the average grade of all students and then print out the names of students who have a grade above the average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grade(grades):
    """
    Calculate the average grade of all students.

    Args:
    grades (dict): A dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.

    Returns:
    float: The average grade of all students.
    """
    return sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)


def get_students_above_average(grades):
    """
    Get the names of students who have a grade above the average.

    Args:
    grades (dict): A dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.

    Returns:
    list: A list of student names who have a grade above the average.
    """
    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)
    return [name for name, grade in grades.items() if grade > average_grade]


def main():
    # Example usage:
    grades = {
        "John": 85,
        "Alice": 92,
        "Bob": 78,
        "Charlie": 95,
        "David": 88
    }

    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)
    students_above_average = get_students_above_average(grades)

    print(f"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}")
    print("Students with grade above average:")
    for student in students_above_average:
        print(student)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Average grade: 87.60
Students with grade above average:
Alice
Charlie
David
```
