## Exercise
Perform basic bitwise operations, such as AND and OR, on two integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bitwise_operations(a, b):
    """
    Perform basic bitwise operations on two integers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the results of the bitwise AND and OR operations.
    """
    # Perform bitwise AND operation
    and_result = a & b
    
    # Perform bitwise OR operation
    or_result = a | b

    return {
        "Bitwise AND": and_result,
        "Bitwise OR": or_result,
    }

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 5   # 101 in binary
    b = 3   # 011 in binary

    results = bitwise_operations(a, b)

    print("Results:")
    for operation, result in results.items():
        print(f"{operation}: {result} ({bin(result)[2:]} in binary)")
```

## Generated Output
```
Results:
Bitwise AND: 1 (1 in binary)
Bitwise OR: 7 (111 in binary)
```
