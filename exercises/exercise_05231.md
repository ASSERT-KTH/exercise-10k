## Exercise
Write a program that takes a sequence of numbers as input, and prints 'Increasing' if the sequence is increasing, 'Decreasing' if the sequence is decreasing, and 'Neither' otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
a = input()

b = a.split()
c = list(map(int, b))

if len(c) == 1:
    print("Neither")
else:
    d = [i > i - 1 for i in c[1:]]
    e = [i < i - 1 for i in c[1:]]

    if all(d):
        print("Increasing")
    elif all(e):
        print("Decreasing")
    else:
        print("Neither")
```

## Generated Output
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp5n60973i.py", line 4, in <module>
    c = list(map(int, b))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[1,'
