## Exercise
Write a program that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are dictionaries containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and then find the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, your program should return all of them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def students_average_grade(students):
    # Initialize variables
    students_avg = {}
    students_avg_list = []

    # Calculate average grades
    for student, grades in students.items():
        avg = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
        students_avg[student] = avg
        students_avg_list.append(avg)

    # Find the highest average grade
    max_avg = max(students_avg_list)

    # Find students with the highest average grade
    students_max_avg = []
    for student, avg in students_avg.items():
        if avg == max_avg:
            students_max_avg.append(student)

    return students_max_avg

# Example usage
students = {
    'John': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},
    'Alice': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85},
    'Bob': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 95, 'English': 90},
    'Charlie': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},
    'David': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85}
}

result = students_average_grade(students)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
['John', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
```
