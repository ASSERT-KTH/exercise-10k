## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the compound interest on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency=1):
    """
    Calculate the compound interest on a loan.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of the loan.
        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.
        time_period (int): The number of years the loan is for.
        compounding_frequency (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        float: The total amount of the loan after the given time period.
    """
    total_amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate / compounding_frequency) ** (compounding_frequency * time_period)
    return total_amount

def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time_period = int(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))
    compounding_frequency = int(input("Enter the compounding frequency (per year): "))

    total_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency)
    interest_earned = total_amount - principal

    print(f"Total amount after {time_period} years: ${total_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Interest earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpauls5br1.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpauls5br1.py", line 18, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
