## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_gcd(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a for loop.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.
    """
    # Find the smaller number
    smaller_num = min(num1, num2)

    # Initialize GCD as 1
    gcd = 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to the smaller number
    for i in range(2, smaller_num + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of both numbers
        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:
            # Update GCD
            gcd = i

    return gcd


def main():
    # Test the function
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {calculate_gcd(num1, num2)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6
```
