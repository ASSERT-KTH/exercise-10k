## Exercise
Develop a program that determines a student's status based on their attendance and grades. The program should use if/else statements to determine the student's status.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_student_status(attendance, grade):
    """
    Calculate a student's status based on their attendance and grade.

    Args:
        attendance (float): The student's attendance percentage.
        grade (float): The student's grade percentage.

    Returns:
        str: The student's status.
    """
    if attendance < 80:
        return "Probation"
    elif grade < 50:
        return "Failed"
    elif grade >= 80 and attendance >= 90:
        return "Honors"
    elif grade >= 70 and attendance >= 80:
        return "Pass"
    else:
        return "Warning"

def main():
    # Example usage
    attendance = float(input("Enter the student's attendance percentage: "))
    grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade percentage: "))
    status = calculate_student_status(attendance, grade)
    print(f"The student's status is: {status}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's attendance percentage: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpa13wgs6s.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpa13wgs6s.py", line 25, in main
    attendance = float(input("Enter the student's attendance percentage: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '90, 85'
