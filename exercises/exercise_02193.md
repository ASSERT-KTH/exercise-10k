## Exercise
Write a function to sort the characters in a given string. The function should return the sorted string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_string(s):
    """
    This function takes a string as input, sorts its characters in ascending order, 
    and returns the sorted string.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: The sorted string.
    """

    # First, we need to convert the string into a list because strings in Python are immutable
    # and cannot be sorted directly.
    char_list = list(s)
    
    # Now, we use the built-in sorted function in Python to sort the list of characters.
    # The sorted function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.
    sorted_list = sorted(char_list)
    
    # Finally, we join the sorted characters back into a string using the join method.
    # The join method concatenates all the characters in the list into a single string.
    sorted_string = ''.join(sorted_list)
    
    # We return the sorted string.
    return sorted_string

# Example usage:
print(sort_string("hello"))  # Output: "ehllo"
```

## Generated Output
```
ehllo
```
