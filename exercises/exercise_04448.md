## Exercise
Write a program that plays Rock Paper Scissors with the user. The computer should generate a random choice and the user should be able to input their choice. The program should then print out the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Returns the user's choice"""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return user_choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Returns the winner of the game"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
       (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: paper

Computer wins!
```
