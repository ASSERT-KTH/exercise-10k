## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers and an integer representing the number of steps to move, and returns the resulting list after moving each element in the list the specified number of steps to the right. If an element is at the end of the list, it should wrap around to the beginning. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number of steps is 2, the resulting list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

## Reference Solution
```python
def move_elements(lst, steps):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers and an integer representing the number of steps to move,
    and returns the resulting list after moving each element in the list the specified number of steps to the right.
    
    If an element is at the end of the list, it should wrap around to the beginning.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.
        steps (int): The number of steps to move.

    Returns:
        list: The resulting list after moving each element.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return lst

    # Calculate the effective number of steps by finding the remainder when the number of steps is divided by the length of the list
    # This is because after len(lst) steps, the list will be the same as the original list
    effective_steps = steps % len(lst)
    
    # Split the list into two parts at the effective number of steps from the end
    # The part from the effective number of steps to the end will be moved to the beginning of the list
    # The part from the beginning to the effective number of steps will be moved to the end of the list
    first_part = lst[-effective_steps:]
    second_part = lst[:-effective_steps]
    
    # Combine the two parts in the correct order to get the resulting list
    resulting_list = first_part + second_part
    
    # Return the resulting list
    return resulting_list

# Test the function
print(move_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
