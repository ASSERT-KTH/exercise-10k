## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the compound interest on an investment.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):
    """
    Calculate compound interest on an investment.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial investment amount.
        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).
        time (int): The time period of the investment (in years).
        frequency (int): The number of times interest is compounded per year.

    Returns:
        float: The final amount after compound interest.
    """
    final_amount = principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)
    return final_amount

def main():
    print("Compound Interest Calculator")
    print("--------------------------------")

    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = int(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))
    frequency = int(input("Enter the compounding frequency (per year): "))

    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)
    interest_earned = final_amount - principal

    print(f"\nFinal Amount: ${final_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Interest Earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Compound Interest Calculator
--------------------------------
Enter the principal amount: $
