## Exercise
Write a program to find the common elements in two arrays.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_elements(array1, array2):
    """
    Find the common elements in two arrays.

    Args:
        array1 (list): The first array.
        array2 (list): The second array.

    Returns:
        list: A list of common elements.
    """
    # Convert the arrays to sets for efficient lookup
    set1 = set(array1)
    set2 = set(array2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    common = set1 & set2

    # Convert the result back to a list and return it
    return list(common)


def main():
    # Example usage
    array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    common = common_elements(array1, array2)
    print("Common elements:", common)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Common elements: [4, 5]
```
