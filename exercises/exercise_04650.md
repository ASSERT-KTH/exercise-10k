## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a year is a leap year. If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a year is a leap year.

    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, 
    or if the year is divisible by 400.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the year is divisible by 4
    if year % 4 == 0:
        # Check if the year is not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400
        if year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
            return True

    return False


def main():
    # Example usage:
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a year is a leap year.

    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, 
    or if the year is divisible by 400.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a year: 2020 is a leap year.
```
