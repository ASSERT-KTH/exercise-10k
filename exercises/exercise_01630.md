## Exercise
Create a program that takes a list of names and a list of ages as input and returns a dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age.

## Reference Solution
```python
def create_name_age_dict(names, ages):
    """
    This function takes two lists as input, one for names and one for ages.
    It returns a dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age.
    
    Args:
        names (list): A list of names
        ages (list): A list of ages
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age
    """
    
    # Check if the lengths of the two lists are equal
    if len(names) != len(ages):
        raise ValueError("The lists of names and ages must be of the same length")
    
    # Use zip to pair corresponding elements from the two lists
    # and a dictionary comprehension to create the desired dictionary
    name_age_dict = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}
    
    return name_age_dict


# Example usage:
names = ["John", "Alice", "Bob"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]

name_age_dict = create_name_age_dict(names, ages)
print(name_age_dict)
```

```python
{'John': 25, 'Alice': 30, 'Bob': 35}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 25, 'Alice': 30, 'Bob': 35}
```
