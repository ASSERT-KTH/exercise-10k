## Exercise
Create a lambda function to square a number and apply it to a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a lambda function to square a number
square = lambda x: x ** 2

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the lambda function to the list using map()
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))

# Print the squared numbers
print(squared_numbers)
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [(lambda x: x ** 2)(x) for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
