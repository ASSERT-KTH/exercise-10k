## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the grade scale
grade_scale = {
    'A': range(90, 101),
    'B': range(80, 90),
    'C': range(70, 80),
    'D': range(60, 70),
    'F': range(0, 60)
}

# Get the student's score
score = int(input("Enter the student's score: "))

# Check the score against the grade scale
for grade, score_range in grade_scale.items():
    if score in score_range:
        print(f"The student's grade is {grade}.")
        break
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is B.
```
