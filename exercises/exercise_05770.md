## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank account. The program should allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        """
        Initializes a BankAccount object with an optional initial balance.

        Args:
            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposits a specified amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.
        """
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws a specified amount from the account, if sufficient funds are available.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.
        """
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        elif amount <= 0:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")

    def check_balance(self):
        """
        Displays the current balance of the account.
        """
        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")


def main():
    account = BankAccount()  # Create a new BankAccount object

    while True:
        print("\nBank Account Simulator Menu:")
        print("1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Quit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == "3":
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
