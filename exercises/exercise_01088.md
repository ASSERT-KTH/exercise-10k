## Exercise
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and outputs their average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(num1, num2, num3):
    """
    This function calculates the average of three numbers.
    
    Parameters:
    num1 (float): The first number.
    num2 (float): The second number.
    num3 (float): The third number.
    
    Returns:
    float: The average of the three numbers.
    """
    average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
    return average

def main():
    # Get the numbers from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

    # Calculate and print the average
    average = calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)
    print(f"The average of the three numbers is: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpoz62yocb.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpoz62yocb.py", line 18, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1 2 3'
```
