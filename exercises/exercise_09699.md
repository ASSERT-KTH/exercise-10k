## Exercise
Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and calculates the result. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Handle invalid operations and division by zero.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    Calculates the result of two numbers based on the given arithmetic operation.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.
        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions
    operations = {
        'addition': lambda x, y: x + y,
        'subtraction': lambda x, y: x - y,
        'multiplication': lambda x, y: x * y,
        'division': lambda x, y: x / y
    }

    # Check if the operation is valid
    if operation not in operations:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation. Supported operations are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division")

    # Check if the operation is division and the second number is zero
    if operation == 'division' and num2 == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")

    # Perform the operation and return the result
    return operations[operation](num1, num2)


def main():
    # Get the numbers and operation from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ")

    try:
        # Calculate and print the result
        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)
        print(f"The result of {operation} {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpper7j7qd.py", line 55, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpper7j7qd.py", line 40, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5 addition'
```
