## Exercise
Explore advanced type systems features, such as dependent types, type classes, and kind systems, and understand their applications.

## Reference Solution
```python
data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type where
  Nil  : Vect 0 a
  Cons : a -> Vect n a -> Vect (S n) a
```

```python
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool

instance Eq Int where
  (==) x y = x == y
```

```python
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat

type family Add (m :: Nat) (n :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Add Zero     n = n
  Add (Succ m) n = Succ (Add m n)
```
