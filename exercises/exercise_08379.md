## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the exponential function of a given number using the Taylor series expansion.

## Reference Solution
```python
def exponential(x, n=50):
    """
    Calculate the exponential function of a given number using the Taylor series expansion.

    Parameters:
    x (float): The input number.
    n (int): The number of terms in the Taylor series expansion. Default is 50.

    Returns:
    float: The exponential function of x.

    """
    exp = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the factorial
        factorial = 1.0
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            factorial *= j

        # Add the current term to the sum
        exp += (x ** i) / factorial

    return exp


def main():
    # Test the function
    x = 2.0
    result = exponential(x)
    print(f"The exponential of {x} is approximately {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The exponential of 2.0 is approximately 7.389056098930649
```
