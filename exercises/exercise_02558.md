## Exercise
Create an async function to perform a concurrent operation and use it to calculate the sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
import asyncio

async def partial_sum(numbers):
    """Calculates the sum of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers)

async def concurrent_sum(lists):
    """Calculates the sum of multiple lists concurrently."""
    tasks = [partial_sum(numbers) for numbers in lists]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return sum(results)

# Example usage:
async def main():
    lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    total_sum = await concurrent_sum(lists)
    print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Generated Output
```
Total sum: 45
```
