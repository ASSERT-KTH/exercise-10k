## Exercise
Write a program that checks if a given string is valid according to the following rules: it must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit. The string must also be between 8 and 32 characters long.

## Reference Solution
```python
import re

def check_string(s):
    """
    Checks if a given string is valid according to the following rules:
    - It must contain at least one lowercase letter.
    - It must contain at least one uppercase letter.
    - It must contain at least one digit.
    - The string must be between 8 and 32 characters long.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the string length is between 8 and 32 characters
    if not 8 <= len(s) <= 32:
        return False

    # Check if the string contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit
    # We use regular expressions to check for these conditions
    if (re.search(r"[a-z]", s) is None or 
        re.search(r"[A-Z]", s) is None or 
        re.search(r"\d", s) is None):
        return False

    # If all conditions are met, the string is valid
    return True


# Example usage:
def main():
    test_cases = [
        "Invalid",  # no digit
        "Invalid1",  # no uppercase letter
        "Invalid1A",  # too short
        "ValidString123",  # valid
        "a" * 33 + "1A"  # too long
    ]

    for test_case in test_cases:
        print(f"Is '{test_case}' valid? {check_string(test_case)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 'Invalid' valid? False
Is 'Invalid1' valid? True
Is 'Invalid1A' valid? True
Is 'ValidString123' valid? True
Is 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1A' valid? False
```
