## Exercise
Write a program that takes an integer as input and classifies it as positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements. The program should also check if the number is even or odd.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x;
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x > 0) {
        std::cout << x << " is positive" << std::endl;
    } else if (x < 0) {
        std::cout << x << " is negative" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << x << " is zero" << std::endl;
    }

    if (x % 2 == 0) {
        std::cout << x << " is even" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << x << " is odd" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
