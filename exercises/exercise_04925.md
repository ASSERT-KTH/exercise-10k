## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of student grades. The program should ask the user to enter a series of grades separated by spaces and then calculate the statistics.

## Reference Solution
```python
import statistics

def calculate_statistics():
    # Get the grades from the user
    grades = input("Enter a series of grades separated by spaces: ")

    # Convert the input into a list of floats
    try:
        grades = [float(grade) for grade in grades.split()]
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers separated by spaces.")
        return

    # Calculate the mean
    mean = statistics.mean(grades)

    # Calculate the median
    median = statistics.median(grades)

    # Calculate the standard deviation
    if len(grades) > 1:
        std_dev = statistics.stdev(grades)
    else:
        std_dev = 0

    # Print the results
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")

def main():
    calculate_statistics()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a series of grades separated by spaces: Mean: 70.0
Median: 70.0
Standard Deviation: 15.811388300841896
```
