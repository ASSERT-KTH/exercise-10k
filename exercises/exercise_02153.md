    """
    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
            for row in csv_reader:
                print(row)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{file_name}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

def main():
    file_name = input("Enter the CSV file name: ")
    read_csv_file(file_name)
