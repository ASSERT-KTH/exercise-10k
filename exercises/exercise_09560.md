## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The function should iterate through each element in the list and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max_value(lst):
    """
    This function finds the maximum value in a given list of integers.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The maximum value in the list. If the list is empty, it returns None.
    """

    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return None
    
    # Initialize the maximum value with the first element of the list
    # We assume that the first element is the maximum value for now
    max_val = lst[0]
    
    # Iterate through each element in the list starting from the second element
    for num in lst[1:]:
        
        # For each element, check if it's greater than the current maximum value
        if num > max_val:
            
            # If it's greater, update the maximum value
            max_val = num
    
    # After iterating through all elements, return the maximum value
    return max_val

# Example usage:
numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]
print(find_max_value(numbers))  # Output: 89
```

## Generated Output
```
89
```
