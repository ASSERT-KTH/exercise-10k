## Exercise
Create a function that returns another function with access to its own scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function that returns another function with access to its own scope.
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    This function returns another function with access to its own scope.

    Args:
        outer_variable (any): A variable that will be accessible in the inner function.

    Returns:
        function: A function that has access to the outer function's scope.
    """

    # Define an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        # The inner function can access and use the outer_variable.
        print(f"Outer variable: {outer_variable}")
        print(f"Inner variable: {inner_variable}")

    # Return the inner function.
    return inner_function

# Create a new function by calling the outer function with an argument.
new_function = outer_function("Hello, world!")

# Call the new function with an argument.
new_function("This is an inner variable.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: Hello, world!
Inner variable: This is an inner variable.
```
