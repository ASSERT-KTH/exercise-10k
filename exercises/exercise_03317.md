## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing the elements that are common to both lists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def common_elements(list1, list2):
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    result = [element for element in list1 if element in list2]
    return result

print(common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]))
```

## Generated Output
