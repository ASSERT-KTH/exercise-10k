## Exercise
Write a program that determines the day of the week based on the day number using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_day(day_number):
    if day_number == 1:
        return "Monday"
    elif day_number == 2:
        return "Tuesday"
    elif day_number == 3:
        return "Wednesday"
    elif day_number == 4:
        return "Thursday"
    elif day_number == 5:
        return "Friday"
    elif day_number == 6:
        return "Saturday"
    elif day_number == 7:
        return "Sunday"
    else:
        return "Invalid day number. Day number should be between 1 and 7."

def main():
    day_number = int(input("Enter the day number (1-7): "))
    print("The day of the week is:", find_day(day_number))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
