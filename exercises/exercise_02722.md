        float: The average of the list of numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate average of an empty list")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def main():
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of {numbers} is {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
