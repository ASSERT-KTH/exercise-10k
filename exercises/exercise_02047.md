## Exercise
Create a function to sort the keys of a dictionary and return them as a list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sort_dict_keys(dictionary):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary as input, sorts its keys, and returns them as a list.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
        list: A list of sorted dictionary keys.
    """

    # First, we need to get all the keys from the dictionary. We can use the .keys() method for this.
    keys = dictionary.keys()

    # Since .keys() returns a dictionary view object, we need to convert it to a list. We can use the list() function for this.
    keys_list = list(keys)

    # Now, we can sort the list of keys. We can use the sorted() function for this.
    # The sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.
    sorted_keys = sorted(keys_list)

    # Finally, we return the sorted list of keys.
    return sorted_keys

# Example usage:
my_dict = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}
print(sort_dict_keys(my_dict))  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## Generated Output
```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```
