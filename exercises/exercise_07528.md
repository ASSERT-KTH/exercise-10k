## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input, and returns a new string where every word is capitalized and the first letter of each word is doubled. For example, 'hello world' should become 'HhEllo WwOrld'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def double_first_letter_and_capitalize(s):
    """
    This function takes a string as input, and returns a new string where every word is capitalized 
    and the first letter of each word is doubled.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: A new string with every word capitalized and the first letter of each word doubled.
    """

    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()

    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified words
    modified_words = []

    # Iterate over each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word is not empty
        if word:
            # Double the first letter of the word
            doubled_first_letter = word[0].upper() + word[0].lower()
            
            # Capitalize the rest of the word
            capitalized_word = word[1:].capitalize()
            
            # Combine the doubled first letter and the capitalized word
            modified_word = doubled_first_letter + capitalized_word
            
            # Add the modified word to the list of modified words
            modified_words.append(modified_word)
        else:
            # If the word is empty, add it to the list of modified words as is
            modified_words.append(word)

    # Join the modified words back into a string separated by spaces
    modified_string = ' '.join(modified_words)

    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string

# Test the function
print(double_first_letter_and_capitalize('hello world'))  # Outputs: HhEllo WwOrld
```

## Generated Output
```
HhEllo WwOrld
```
