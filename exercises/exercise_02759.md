## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the discount amount given the original price and discount percentage.

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discount amount.

    Args:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        float: The discount amount.
    """
    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage
    return discount_amount

def main():
    # Example usage
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

    discount_amount = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)
    print(f"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Price after discount: ${original_price - discount_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
