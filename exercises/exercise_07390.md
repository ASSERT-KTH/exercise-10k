## Exercise
Create a program that takes in three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print out the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def arithmetic_operations(a, b, c):
    # Print the results of the operations
    print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")
    print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {a - b}")
    print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {a * b}")
    print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {a / b}")

# Call the function with three numbers
arithmetic_operations(1, 2, 3)
```

## Generated Output
```
Addition: 1 + 2 = 3
Subtraction: 1 - 2 = -1
Multiplication: 1 * 2 = 2
Division: 1 / 2 = 0.5
```
