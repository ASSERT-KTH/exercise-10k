## Exercise
Create a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors)"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Returns the user's choice (rock, paper, or scissors)"""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        if user_choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
