## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.

    Parameters:
    score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
    str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
        return 'D'
    elif score < 60 and score >= 0:
        return 'F'
    else:
        return 'Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.'

def main():
    """
    This function gets the score from the user and prints out their grade.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    
    print("The student's grade is:", calculate_grade(score))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is: B
```
