## Exercise
Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def difference(list1, list2):
    """
    Returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.

    Args:
        list1 (list): The first list.
        list2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.
    """
    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

result = difference(list1, list2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

```python
def difference(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1) - set(list2))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
