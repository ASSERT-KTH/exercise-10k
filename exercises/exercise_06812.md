## Exercise
Write a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (integer, float, string, boolean) and then prints out their values and data types. Ensure the variables are named appropriately to reflect their contents.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare and initialize variables
student_id = 1
student_gpa = 3.8
student_name = "John Doe"
is_enrolled = True

# Print variables and their data types
print("Student ID:", student_id, type(student_id))
print("Student GPA:", student_gpa, type(student_gpa))
print("Student Name:", student_name, type(student_name))
print("Is Enrolled:", is_enrolled, type(is_enrolled))
```

## Generated Output
```
Student ID: 1 <class 'int'>
Student GPA: 3.8 <class 'float'>
Student Name: John Doe <class 'str'>
Is Enrolled: True <class 'bool'>
```
