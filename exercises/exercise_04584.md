## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a new list with numbers above the threshold

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold):
    """
    Filters a list of numbers based on a given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
        threshold (float): The threshold value.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the numbers above the threshold.
    """
    return [num for num in numbers if num > threshold]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    threshold = 3
    result = filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold)
    print(result)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4, 5, 6]
```
