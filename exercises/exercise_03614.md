## Exercise
Write a function that uses an anonymous function to filter a list of numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, threshold):
    """
    Filters a list of numbers based on a given threshold.

    Args:
    - numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.
    - threshold (int or float): The threshold value to filter by.

    Returns:
    - list: A new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.
    """
    return list(filter(lambda x: x > threshold, numbers))

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
threshold = 5

filtered_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, threshold)
print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Filtered List (numbers > {}):".format(threshold), filtered_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Filtered List (numbers > 5): [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
