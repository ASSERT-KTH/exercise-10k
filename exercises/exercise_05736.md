## Exercise
Create a function that returns a new function that has access to the outer function's scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining the outer function.
def outer_function():
    """
    This function returns a new function that has access to the outer function's scope.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function with access to the outer function's scope.
    """
    
    # We define a variable in the outer function's scope.
    outer_variable = "I'm in the outer function's scope"
    
    # We define the inner function. This function will have access to the outer function's scope.
    def inner_function():
        # We can access the outer function's variable from within the inner function.
        print(outer_variable)
        
    # We return the inner function. This allows the inner function to be used outside of the outer function.
    return inner_function

# We call the outer function to get the inner function.
inner_func = outer_function()

# We call the inner function to demonstrate that it has access to the outer function's scope.
inner_func()
```

## Generated Output
```
I'm in the outer function's scope
```
