## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and then prints out their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Ask the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_of_nums = num1 + num2

# Print out the sum
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_nums}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzo0jofxt.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 10'
```
