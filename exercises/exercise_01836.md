## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of all elements in a given array.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_of_squares(array):
    return sum(i**2 for i in array)

# Example usage:
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(array)
print("Sum of squares:", result)
```

```python
import numpy as np

def sum_of_squares(array):
    return np.sum(np.square(array))

# Example usage:
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = sum_of_squares(array)
print("Sum of squares:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of squares: 55
```
