## Exercise
Write a program that determines a student's status based on their grade. If the grade is 90 or above, the student is 'Honors'. If the grade is between 80 and 89, the student is 'Good standing'. If the grade is between 70 and 79, the student is 'Probation'. If the grade is below 70, the student is 'Failed'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def determine_student_status(grade):
    """
    Determine a student's status based on their grade.

    Args:
        grade (float): The student's grade.

    Returns:
        str: The student's status.
    """
    if grade >= 90:
        return "Honors"
    elif 80 <= grade < 90:
        return "Good standing"
    elif 70 <= grade < 80:
        return "Probation"
    else:
        return "Failed"


def main():
    # Example usage
    grade = float(input("Enter the student's grade: "))
    status = determine_student_status(grade)
    print(f"The student's status is: {status}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's grade: The student's status is: Good standing
```
