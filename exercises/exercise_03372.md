## Exercise
Use a for loop to generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_perfect_squares(limit):
    """
    Generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit.

    Args:
    limit (int): The upper limit for the perfect squares.

    Returns:
    list: A list of perfect squares up to the given limit.
    """
    perfect_squares = []
    i = 1
    while True:
        square = i ** 2
        if square > limit:
            break
        perfect_squares.append(square)
        i += 1
    return perfect_squares

# Example usage:
limit = 100
result = generate_perfect_squares(limit)
print(f"Perfect squares up to {limit}: {result}")
```

```python
import math

def generate_perfect_squares(limit):
    """
    Generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit.

    Args:
    limit (int): The upper limit for the perfect squares.

    Returns:
    list: A list of perfect squares up to the given limit.
    """
    perfect_squares = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(limit)) + 1):
        perfect_squares.append(i ** 2)
    return perfect_squares

# Example usage:
limit = 100
result = generate_perfect_squares(limit)
print(f"Perfect squares up to {limit}: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Perfect squares up to 100: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
