## Exercise
Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate(num1, num2):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2.
    """

    # First, we calculate the sum of the two numbers
    sum_result = num1 + num2  # Adding num1 and num2 and storing the result in sum_result

    # Next, we calculate the difference of the two numbers
    difference_result = num1 - num2  # Subtracting num2 from num1 and storing the result in difference_result

    # Then, we calculate the product of the two numbers
    product_result = num1 * num2  # Multiplying num1 and num2 and storing the result in product_result

    # After that, we calculate the quotient of the two numbers
    # We need to check if num2 is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError
    if num2 == 0:  # Checking if num2 is zero
        quotient_result = "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"  # If num2 is zero, we store an error message in quotient_result
    else:
        quotient_result = num1 / num2  # If num2 is not zero, we divide num1 by num2 and store the result in quotient_result

    # Finally, we return the results as a tuple
    return sum_result, difference_result, product_result, quotient_result  # Returning the results as a tuple


# Example usage:
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
sum_result, difference_result, product_result, quotient_result = calculate(num1, num2)
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum: 12
Difference: 8
Product: 20
Quotient: 5.0
```
