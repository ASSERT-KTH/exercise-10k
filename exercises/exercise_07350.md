## Exercise
Perform a bitwise AND operation on the integers 5 and 3, then print the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bitwise_and(a, b):
    """
    Perform a bitwise AND operation on two integers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The result of the bitwise AND operation.
    """
    return a & b

# Example usage:
a = 5   # Binary: 101
b = 3   # Binary: 011

result = bitwise_and(a, b)
print(f"The result of {a} AND {b} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The result of 5 AND 3 is: 1
```
