## Exercise
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: The Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(sequence) < n:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
        return sequence

def main():
    # Example usage
    num_terms = 10
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:")
    print(generate_fibonacci(num_terms))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
