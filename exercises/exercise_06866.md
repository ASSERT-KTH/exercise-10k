## Exercise
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of each operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x, y, z;
    printf("Enter three integers (x, y, z): ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);

    printf("x + y = %d\n", x + y);
    printf("x - y = %d\n", x - y);
    printf("x * y = %d\n", x * y);

    if (z != 0) {
        printf("x / z = %d\n", x / z);
    } else {
        printf("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
