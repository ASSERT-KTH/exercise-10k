## Exercise
Write a program that checks the strength of a password. If the password has at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit, the password is 'Strong'. If the password has at least 6 characters, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one lowercase letter, the password is 'Medium'. If the password has less than 6 characters, the password is 'Weak'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_password_strength(password):
    """
    Checks the strength of a password.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to be checked.

    Returns:
        str: The strength of the password ('Strong', 'Medium', or 'Weak').
    """
    # Initialize flags
    has_uppercase = False
    has_lowercase = False
    has_digit = False

    # Check for each character type
    for char in password:
        if char.isupper():
            has_uppercase = True
        elif char.islower():
            has_lowercase = True
        elif char.isdigit():
            has_digit = True

    # Check password strength
    if len(password) >= 8 and has_uppercase and has_lowercase and has_digit:
        return 'Strong'
    elif len(password) >= 6 and has_uppercase and has_lowercase:
        return 'Medium'
    else:
        return 'Weak'

def main():
    password = input("Enter a password: ")
    strength = check_password_strength(password)
    print(f"The password '{password}' is {strength}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a password: The password 'Password123' is Strong.
```
