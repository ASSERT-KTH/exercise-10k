## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    total = 0  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
            total += i  # If the number is even, add it to the total
    return total  # Return the total sum

# Example usage:
n = 10  # Define the upper limit
result = sum_even_numbers(n)  # Calculate the sum of even numbers
print(f"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30
```
