## Exercise
Create a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 matrix of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the size of the matrix
matrix_size = 5

# Initialize a counter for the numbers
num = 1

# Use nested for loops to print the matrix
for i in range(matrix_size):
    for j in range(matrix_size):
        print(f"{num:2d}", end=" ")
        num += 1
    print()
```

## Generated Output
```
1  2  3  4  5 
 6  7  8  9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25
```
