## Exercise
Write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_sum(lst):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a given list of integers.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all elements in the list.
    """

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum, starting with 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for num in lst:
        # Add the current number to the total sum
        total_sum += num
    
    # Return the total sum after iterating over all elements
    return total_sum

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_sum(numbers))  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
