## Exercise
Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and returns the distance between them.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    """
    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

    Args:
        point1 (list): The coordinates of the first point.
        point2 (list): The coordinates of the second point.

    Returns:
        float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.
    """
    if len(point1) != len(point2):
        raise ValueError("Both points must have the same number of dimensions")

    squared_differences = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]
    return math.sqrt(sum(squared_differences))

def main():
    # Example usage:
    point1 = [1, 2, 3]
    point2 = [4, 5, 6]

    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
    print(f"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The distance between [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] is 5.196152422706632
```
