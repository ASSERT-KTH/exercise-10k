## Exercise
Write a program that takes an amount in USD as input and prints out the equivalent amount in EUR.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the exchange rate (1 USD = x EUR)
# Note: This rate is fictional and may not reflect the current exchange rate.
# For accurate conversions, use a financial API to get the current rate.
exchange_rate = 0.88  # Example rate, 1 USD = 0.88 EUR

def convert_usd_to_eur(amount_usd):
    """
    Converts an amount in USD to EUR based on the given exchange rate.
    
    Parameters:
    - amount_usd: float, the amount in USD to convert.
    
    Returns:
    - float, the equivalent amount in EUR.
    """
    amount_eur = amount_usd * exchange_rate
    return amount_eur

def main():
    # Get the amount in USD from the user
    while True:
        try:
            amount_usd = float(input("Enter the amount in USD: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    
    # Convert the amount and print the result
    amount_eur = convert_usd_to_eur(amount_usd)
    print(f"{amount_usd} USD is equivalent to {amount_eur:.2f} EUR.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the amount in USD: 100.0 USD is equivalent to 88.00 EUR.
```
