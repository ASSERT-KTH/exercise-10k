## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the mode given a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def calculate_mode(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, they are all returned.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each number
    frequency = Counter(numbers)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())

    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency
    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]

    return modes

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)
    print("Mode(s):", modes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mode(s): [4]
```
