## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula (e.g. Fibonacci sequence). Use a while loop to generate the sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    """
    Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    sequence = [0, 1]
    i = 2

    while i < n:
        next_term = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
        sequence.append(next_term)
        i += 1

    return sequence

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 10  # Number of terms in the sequence
    fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(n)
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms: {fib_sequence}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
