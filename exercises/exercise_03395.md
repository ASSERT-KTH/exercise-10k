## Exercise
Write a function to find the standard deviation of a list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of integers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        float: The standard deviation of the list.
    """
    # Calculate the mean
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the variance
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the standard deviation
    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    return standard_deviation

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))
```
