## Exercise
Write a program that takes a score as input from the user and prints the grade based on the following scale: 90-100 A, 80-89 B, 70-79 C, 69 and below F.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculates the grade based on the input score.

    Args:
        score (int): The input score.

    Returns:
        str: The corresponding grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "F"

def main():
    # Get user input
    while True:
        try:
            score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
            if 0 <= score <= 100:
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score (0-100): Your grade is: B
```
