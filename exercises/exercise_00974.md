## Exercise
Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the difference between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in one dictionary but not the other.

## Reference Solution
```python
def dict_diff(dict1, dict2):
    """
    This function finds the difference between two dictionaries.
    
    It returns a tuple of two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2.
    The second dictionary contains key-value pairs that exist in dict2 but not in dict1.

    Parameters:
    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple of two dictionaries representing the differences between the input dictionaries.
    """

    # Create an empty dictionary to store key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2
    diff1 = {}
    
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in dict1
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        # Check if the key is not in dict2 or if the values are different
        if key not in dict2 or dict2[key] != value:
            # Add the key-value pair to diff1
            diff1[key] = value
    
    # Create an empty dictionary to store key-value pairs that exist in dict2 but not in dict1
    diff2 = {}
    
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in dict2
    for key, value in dict2.items():
        # Check if the key is not in dict1 or if the values are different
        if key not in dict1 or dict1[key] != value:
            # Add the key-value pair to diff2
            diff2[key] = value
    
    # Return a tuple containing diff1 and diff2
    return diff1, diff2

# Example usage:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}
print(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))
```

## Generated Output
```
({'a': 1, 'c': 3}, {'c': 4, 'd': 5})
```
