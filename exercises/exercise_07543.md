## Exercise
Create a program that declares and initializes variables to store a student's name, age, and grade level. The program should then print out the stored information in a formatted string. Ensure that the variables are declared with appropriate data types.

## Reference Solution
```python
// Variable declarations
string name = "Luis Larco";
int age = 15;
int level = 9;

// Printing the variables
Console.WriteLine("Name: " + name);
Console.WriteLine("Age: " + age);
Console.WriteLine("Grade Level: " + level);
```

```python
Name: Luis Larco
Age: 15
Grade Level: 9
```
