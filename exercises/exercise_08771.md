## Exercise
Write a function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def first_non_repeated_char(s):
    """
    Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The first non-repeated character. If no such character exists, returns None.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character
    char_count = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
    
    # Find the first non-repeated character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # If no non-repeated character exists, return None
    return None

# Example usage
print(first_non_repeated_char("hello"))  # Output: h
print(first_non_repeated_char("aabbcc"))  # Output: None
```

## Generated Output
```
h
None
```
