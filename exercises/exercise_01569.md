## Exercise
Write a function that uses recursion to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def recursive_sum(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of a list of numbers using recursion.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the numbers in the list.
    """

    # Base case: If the list is empty, return 0 because the sum of no numbers is 0.
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    # If the list only contains one number, return that number because the sum of one number is the number itself.
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return numbers[0]
    
    # Recursive case: Return the first number in the list plus the sum of the rest of the list.
    # We use list slicing to get the rest of the list (from index 1 to the end).
    # We call the recursive_sum function on the rest of the list and add the first number to the result.
    else:
        return numbers[0] + recursive_sum(numbers[1:])

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(recursive_sum(numbers))  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
