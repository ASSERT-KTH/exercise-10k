## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers and a number of positions to rotate the array to the right. The program should rotate the array in-place, meaning it should not create a new array, but modify the existing one.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Rotates the input list to the right by a specified number of positions.
        
        The rotation is done in-place, meaning the input list is modified directly
        without creating a new list.
        
        Args:
            nums (list[int]): The input list to be rotated.
            k (int): The number of positions to rotate the list to the right.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k %= n  # Ensure k is within the range of the list length
        
        def reverse(left, right):
            """
            Reverses the sublist from index left to right (inclusive).
            """
            while left < right:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        
        reverse(0, n - 1)  # Reverse the entire list
        reverse(0, k - 1)  # Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(k, n - 1)  # Reverse the rest of the list
```
