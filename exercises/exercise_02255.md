    return sum(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_numbers(numbers)
print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {result}")
```

```python
def sum_numbers():
    numbers = input("Enter a series of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]
    return sum(numbers)

result = sum_numbers()
print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {result}")
