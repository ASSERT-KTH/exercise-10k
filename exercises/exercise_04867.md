## Exercise
Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_vowels(string):
    """
    Counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    
    Parameters:
    string (str): The input string to count vowels from.
    
    Returns:
    int: The total number of vowels in the string.
    """
    # Initialize a counter for vowels
    vowel_count = 0
    
    # Initialize a pointer to the start of the string
    i = 0
    
    # Loop through the string until we reach the end
    while i < len(string):
        # Get the current character
        char = string[i].lower()
        
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in 'aeiou':
            # If it's a vowel, increment the counter
            vowel_count += 1
        
        # Move to the next character
        i += 1
    
    # Return the total vowel count
    return vowel_count

# Example usage:
input_string = "Hello, World!"
print("Vowel count:", count_vowels(input_string))
```

## Generated Output
```
Vowel count: 3
```
