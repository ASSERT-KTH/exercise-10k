## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the function
def student_grade(score):
    # Check if the score is 90 or above
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    # Check if the score is 80 or above
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    # Check if the score is 70 or above
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    # Check if the score is 60 or above
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
    # If none of the above conditions are met, the grade is F
    else:
        grade = "F"
    # Return the calculated grade
    return grade

# Get the student's score from the user
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Print the grade
print("Your grade is: ", student_grade(score))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Your grade is:  B
```
