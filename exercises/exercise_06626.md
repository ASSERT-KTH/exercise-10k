## Exercise
Create a function that uses a lambda expression to filter out even numbers from a list

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_even_numbers(num_list):
    """
    Filter out even numbers from a list using a lambda expression.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of odd integers.
    """
    # Use filter() with a lambda expression to filter out even numbers
    odd_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, num_list))
    
    return odd_numbers

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    print("Original List:", numbers)
    print("Odd Numbers:", filter_even_numbers(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Odd Numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
