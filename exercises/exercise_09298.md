## Exercise
Create a function that takes two strings as input and returns the concatenated string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def concat_strings(str1, str2):
    """
    This function takes two strings as input and returns the concatenated string.

    Parameters:
    str1 (str): The first string to be concatenated.
    str2 (str): The second string to be concatenated.

    Returns:
    str: The concatenated string.
    """

    # First, we define the function with two parameters, str1 and str2, which are the strings to be concatenated.
    
    # Now, we use the built-in string concatenation operator in Python, which is '+', to concatenate the two strings.
    concatenated_str = str1 + str2
    
    # Finally, we return the concatenated string.
    return concatenated_str

# Example usage:
print(concat_strings("Hello, ", "world!"))  # Outputs: Hello, world!
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello, world!
```
