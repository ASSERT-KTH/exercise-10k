## Exercise
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the generated number. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made
    tries = 0

    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, the number was {}.".format(number_to_guess))
            break
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue

        # Increment the number of tries the player has made
        tries += 1

        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You've guessed the number in {} tries.".format(tries))
            play_again = input("Would you like to play again? (yes/no): ")
            if play_again.lower() == "yes":
                guess_the_number()
            else:
                print("Thanks for playing!")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_the_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Too low! Try again.
Take a guess:
