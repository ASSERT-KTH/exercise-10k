## Exercise
Create a program that sorts a list using the merge sort algorithm with a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

    Args:
    arr (list): The list to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.
    """
    # If the array has only one element, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Find the middle of the array
    mid = len(arr) // 2

    # Divide the array into two halves
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]

    # Recursively sort the two halves
    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    # Merge the two sorted halves
    return merge(left, right)


def merge(left, right):
    """
    Merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.

    Args:
    left (list): The first sorted list.
    right (list): The second sorted list.

    Returns:
    list: The merged sorted list.
    """
    merged = []
    i = j = 0

    # Merge the two lists
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            merged.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements
    while i < len(left):
        merged.append(left[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(right):
        merged.append(right[j])
        j += 1

    return merged


def main():
    # Test the merge sort function
    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    print("Original array:", arr)
    print("Sorted array:", merge_sort(arr))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
