## Exercise
Create a program that prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite color. The program should then print out a greeting message that includes the user's name, their age, and their favorite color.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Get user information from input."""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
    favorite_color = input("Please enter your favorite color: ")
    return name, age, favorite_color

def print_greeting(name, age, favorite_color):
    """Print a greeting message with user information."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and your favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

def main():
    """Main program function."""
    name, age, favorite_color = get_user_info()
    print_greeting(name, age, favorite_color)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
