## Exercise
Create a function that takes a string and a substring as arguments and returns the number of occurrences of the substring

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_substring_occurrences(string, substring):
    """
    Returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string.

    Args:
        string (str): The main string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the substring.
    """
    return string.count(substring)

# Example usage:
def main():
    string = "Hello, world! Hello again!"
    substring = "Hello"
    occurrences = count_substring_occurrences(string, substring)
    print(f"The substring '{substring}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The substring 'Hello' occurs 2 times in the string.
