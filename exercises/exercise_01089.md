## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their absolute difference.

## Reference Solution
```python
def absolute_difference(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.
    
    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        float: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.
    """
    return abs(num1 - num2)

def main():
    # Get the two numbers from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate and print the absolute difference
    difference = absolute_difference(num1, num2)
    print(f"The absolute difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpab451502.py", line 24, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpab451502.py", line 16, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 4'
```
