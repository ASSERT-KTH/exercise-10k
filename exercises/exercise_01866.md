## Exercise
Write a program to filter a list based on a condition and print the filtered list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Filters a list based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: The filtered list.
    """
    return [item for item in input_list if condition(item)]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Define a condition function
    def is_even(num):
        return num % 2 == 0

    # Filter the list
    filtered_numbers = filter_list(numbers, is_even)

    # Print the filtered list
    print("Filtered list:", filtered_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Filtered list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
