## Exercise
Declare two float variables with the values 10.5 and 20.5. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the variables and print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Declare two float variables
num1 = 10.5
num2 = 20.5

# Calculate and print the sum
sum_result = num1 + num2
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}")

# Calculate and print the difference
difference_result = num1 - num2
print(f"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is: {difference_result}")

# Calculate and print the product
product_result = num1 * num2
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {product_result}")

# Calculate and print the quotient
if num2 != 0:
    quotient_result = num1 / num2
    print(f"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is: {quotient_result}")
else:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 31.0
The difference of 10.5 and 20.5 is: -10.0
The product of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 215.25
The quotient of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 0.5121951219512195
