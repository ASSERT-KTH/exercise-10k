## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all elements reversed. The function should also include a feature to remove any duplicate numbers from the resulting list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reverse_and_remove_duplicates(input_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of integers, reverses the order of elements, 
    and removes any duplicate numbers from the resulting list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with all elements reversed and duplicates removed.
    """

    # First, we'll reverse the input list using slicing
    reversed_list = input_list[::-1]
    
    # Then, we'll convert the reversed list to a set to remove duplicates
    # Since sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values, this is an efficient way to remove duplicates
    # However, sets are unordered, so we'll need to convert it back to a list and sort it if needed
    unique_set = set(reversed_list)
    
    # Now, we'll convert the set back to a list
    unique_list = list(unique_set)
    
    # Finally, we'll return the list with unique elements
    return unique_list

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]
print(reverse_and_remove_duplicates(numbers))
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
