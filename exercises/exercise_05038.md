## Exercise
Write a program that simulates an employee database using for loops and while loops.

## Reference Solution
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age, department):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.department = department

class EmployeeDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, name, age, department):
        new_employee = Employee(name, age, department)
        self.employees.append(new_employee)
        print(f"{name} added to the database.")

    def remove_employee(self, name):
        for employee in self.employees:
            if employee.name.lower() == name.lower():
                self.employees.remove(employee)
                print(f"{name} removed from the database.")
                return
        print(f"{name} not found in the database.")

    def view_employees(self):
        for i, employee in enumerate(self.employees):
            print(f"Employee {i+1}:")
            print(f"Name: {employee.name}")
            print(f"Age: {employee.age}")
            print(f"Department: {employee.department}")
            print("------------------------")

def main():
    database = EmployeeDatabase()

    while True:
        print("Employee Database Menu:")
        print("1. Add Employee")
        print("2. Remove Employee")
        print("3. View Employees")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            name = input("Enter employee name: ")
            age = int(input("Enter employee age: "))
            department = input("Enter employee department: ")
            database.add_employee(name, age, department)
        elif choice == "2":
            name = input("Enter employee name to remove: ")
            database.remove_employee(name)
        elif choice == "3":
            database.view_employees()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Employee Database Menu:
1. Add Employee
2. Remove Employee
3. View Employees
4. Exit
Enter your choice: Invalid choice. Please try again.
Employee Database Menu:
1. Add Employee
2. Remove Employee
3. View Employees
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbnm4gws1.py", line 61, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpbnm4gws1.py", line 42, in main
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
