## Exercise
Write a function that generates a random password of a specified length. The password should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    """
    Generates a random password of a specified length.
    
    The password contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    
    Parameters:
    length (int): The length of the password to be generated.
    
    Returns:
    str: A random password of the specified length.
    """

    # First, we need to define the characters that we want to include in our password
    # We'll use the string module's constants for this
    all_characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    
    # If the length is less than 1, we can't generate a password, so we'll return an error message
    if length < 1:
        return "Length must be at least 1"
    
    # Now, we'll generate our password by randomly selecting characters from our set of all characters
    # We'll use a list comprehension to generate the password
    # This is more memory efficient than concatenating strings in a loop
    password = [random.choice(all_characters) for _ in range(length)]
    
    # Finally, we'll join our list of characters into a single string and return it
    # We use the join method to do this, which is more efficient than concatenating strings in a loop
    return ''.join(password)

# Test the function
print(generate_password(10))
```

## Generated Output
```
b1p^=~#0_F
```
