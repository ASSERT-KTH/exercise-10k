## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_first_occurrence(string, char):
    """
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        char (str): The character to find.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the character. Returns -1 if the character is not found.
    """
    try:
        return string.index(char)
    except ValueError:
        return -1

# Example usage
def main():
    string = "Hello, World!"
    char = "W"
    index = find_first_occurrence(string, char)
    
    if index != -1:
        print(f"The first occurrence of '{char}' is at index {index}.")
    else:
        print(f"'{char}' not found in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
