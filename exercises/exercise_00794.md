## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the standard deviation given a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_variance(numbers, mean):
    """Calculate the variance of a list of numbers."""
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return variance

def calculate_standard_deviation(variance):
    """Calculate the standard deviation from the variance."""
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main(numbers):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers."""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers, mean)
    standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(variance)
    return standard_deviation

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
standard_deviation = main(numbers)
print("Standard Deviation:", standard_deviation)
```

## Generated Output
```
Standard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951
```
