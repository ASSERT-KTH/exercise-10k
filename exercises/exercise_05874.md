## Exercise
Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    # Initialize the maximum number of attempts
    max_attempts = 6
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    print(f"You have {max_attempts} attempts to guess the correct number.")
    
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
        
        # Check if the user's guess is a valid number
        if not user_guess.isdigit():
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
            continue
        
        # Convert the user's guess to an integer
        user_guess = int(user_guess)
        
        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range
        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:
            print("Your guess is out of range. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in {attempts} attempts.")
            return
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too low. Try again!")
        else:
            print("Your guess is too high. Try again!")
        
        # Print the remaining attempts
        print(f"You have {max_attempts - attempts} attempts remaining.")
    
    # If the user runs out of attempts, reveal the correct number
    print(f"Sorry, you didn't guess the correct number. The correct number was {number_to_guess}.")

# Run the game
number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 6 attempts to guess the correct number.
Enter your guess: Your guess is too low. Try again!
You have 5 attempts remaining.
Enter your guess:
