## Exercise
Write a program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not based on the following conditions: a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_leap(year):
    leap = False

    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                leap = True
        else:
            leap = True

    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
```

## Generated Output
```
True
```
