## Exercise
Create a program that plays a game of mad libs with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get user input for a specific type of word
def get_word(prompt):
    while True:
        word = input(prompt)
        if word:
            return word
        else:
            print("Please enter a word.")

# Define a function to play the Mad Libs game
def play_mad_libs():
    print("Welcome to Mad Libs!")
    print("Please provide the following words:")

    # Get user input for different types of words
    name = get_word("Enter a name: ")
    adjective1 = get_word("Enter an adjective: ")
    adjective2 = get_word("Enter another adjective: ")
    adjective3 = get_word("Enter one more adjective: ")
    noun1 = get_word("Enter a noun: ")
    noun2 = get_word("Enter another noun: ")
    animal = get_word("Enter an animal: ")
    food = get_word("Enter a food: ")

    # Define a list of Mad Libs stories
    stories = [
        f"One day, {name} was walking through the forest when they came across a {adjective1} {noun1}. They were so surprised that they jumped into a {adjective2} {noun2} and started to {adjective3} like a {animal}. After a while, they got hungry and decided to eat a {food}.",
        f"{name} was a {adjective1} person who loved to eat {food}. One day, they decided to go on a {adjective2} adventure and ride a {animal} through the {adjective3} countryside. They passed by a {noun1} and a {noun2} and had a great time.",
        f"In a {adjective1} land far, far away, there lived a {adjective2} {name} who loved to play with a {noun1} and a {noun2}. One day, they decided to go on a {adjective3} quest to find a {food} and a {animal}. They had a great time and learned a lot about the importance of being {adjective1}."
    ]

    # Select a random story from the list
    story = random.choice(stories)

    # Print the completed Mad Libs story
    print("\nHere's your completed Mad Libs story:")
    print(story)

# Call the function to play the Mad Libs game
play_mad_libs()
```
