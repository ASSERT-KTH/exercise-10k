## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to calculate the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(amount, denominations):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount.

    Args:
    - amount (int): The amount to make change for.
    - denominations (list): A list of available coin denominations.

    Returns:
    - int: The minimum number of coins required.
    """
    coins = 0
    i = len(denominations) - 1  # start with the largest denomination

    while amount > 0:
        if amount >= denominations[i]:
            # use as many coins of the current denomination as possible
            amount -= denominations[i]
            coins += 1
        else:
            # move to the next smaller denomination
            i -= 1

    return coins


# Example usage
denominations = [1, 5, 10, 25]  # available coin denominations
amount = 37  # amount to make change for

min_coins_required = min_coins(amount, denominations)
print(f"Minimum coins required: {min_coins_required}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Minimum coins required: 4
```
