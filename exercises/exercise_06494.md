## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a series of numbers and then calculates and prints out the average of the numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculates the average of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def main():
    """Asks the user for a series of numbers, calculates the average, and prints out the result."""
    numbers = []
    
    # Ask the user for numbers until they decide to stop
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == 'q':
            break
        
        try:
            number = float(user_input)
            numbers.append(number)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'q' to quit.")
    
    # Check if the user entered any numbers
    if not numbers:
        print("No numbers entered. Cannot calculate average.")
    else:
        average = calculate_average(numbers)
        print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'q' to quit.
Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp4jl78af_.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp4jl78af_.py", line 11, in main
    user_input = input("Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
