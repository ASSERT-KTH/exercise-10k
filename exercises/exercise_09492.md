## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the script
# The script will take a student's score as input and print out the corresponding grade

read -p "Enter your score: " score

if [ $score -ge 90 ]; then
  echo "Your grade is: A"
elif [ $score -ge 80 ]; then
  echo "Your grade is: B"
elif [ $score -ge 70 ]; then
  echo "Your grade is: C"
elif [ $score -ge 60 ]; then
  echo "Your grade is: D"
else
  echo "Your grade is: F"
fi
