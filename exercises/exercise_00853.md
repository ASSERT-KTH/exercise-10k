## Exercise
Create a function that decorates another function, adding a new behavior to the original function without modifying it.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining our decorator function. This function will take another function as an argument.
def my_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator function that adds a new behavior to the original function without modifying it.
    
    Args:
        func (function): The original function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function with the added behavior.
    """
    
    # Inside our decorator function, we define a new function that will wrap the original function.
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        
        # Before calling the original function, we can add some new behavior.
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        
        # Now we call the original function with the given arguments and keyword arguments.
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # After calling the original function, we can add some more new behavior.
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        
        # Finally, we return the result of the original function.
        return result
    
    # We return the wrapper function from our decorator function.
    return wrapper

# Now we can use our decorator to decorate another function.
@my_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    """
    A function that prints a hello message.
    
    Args:
        name (str): The name of the person to greet.
    """
    
    # This function simply prints a hello message.
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# We can call the decorated function like any other function.
say_hello("John")
```

## Generated Output
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello, John!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```
