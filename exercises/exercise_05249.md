## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the tax for a given income and tax rate.

```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the tax for a given income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g. 0.25 for 25%).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax.
    """
    tax = income * tax_rate
    return tax

def main():
    # Get user input
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g. 25 for 25%): ")) / 100

    # Calculate tax
    tax = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)

    # Print result
    print(f"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}")
    print(f"Your net income is: ${income - tax:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
