## Exercise
Write a program that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 2;
    int add;
    int sub;
    int mult;
    int div;

    add = a + b;
    std::cout << "Addition: " << add << std::endl;

    sub = a - b;
    std::cout << "Subtraction: " << sub << std::endl;

    mult = a * b;
    std::cout << "Multiplication: " << mult << std::endl;

    div = a / b;
    std::cout << "Division: " << div << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
