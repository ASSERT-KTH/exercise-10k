## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the tax for a given income and tax rate. The program should print out the tax amount.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculates the tax amount based on the given income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax amount.
    """
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount


def main():
    # Example usage
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 25 for 25%): "))
    tax_rate_decimal = tax_rate / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal

    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate_decimal)

    print(f"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $

  File "/tmp/tmp87re3fwg.py", line 18, in main
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
