## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. Print the result of each round to the console.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)"""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner of the round"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    elif (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock") or \
         (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper"):
        return "User"
    else:
        return "Computer"

def play_round():
    """Plays a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ")
    while user_choice not in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors: ")
    
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
    
    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == "Tie":
        print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
    elif winner == "User":
        print(f"{user_choice} beats {computer_choice}. You win this round!")
    else:
        print(f"{computer_choice} beats {user_choice}. Computer wins this round!")

def play_game():
    """Plays the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"""
    play_again = "yes"
    while play_again.lower() == "yes":
        play_round()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
        while play_again.lower() not in ["yes", "no"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
