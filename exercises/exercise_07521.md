## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to handle cases where the list is empty.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_max(lst):
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return None
    max_val = lst[0]
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] > max_val:
            max_val = lst[i]
    return max_val

# Example usage:
numbers = [4, 5, 6, 2, 9, 1]
print(find_max(numbers))  # Output: 9
```

## Generated Output
```
9
```
