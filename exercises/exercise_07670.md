## Exercise
Write a function to find the next square number after a given number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def next_square_number(n):
    """
    Find the next square number after a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The given number.

    Returns:
        int: The next square number after n.
    """
    # Calculate the square root of the given number
    root = math.sqrt(n)
    
    # If the square root is an integer, the next square number is the square of the next integer
    if root == int(root):
        next_root = int(root) + 1
    # If the square root is not an integer, the next square number is the square of the ceiling of the square root
    else:
        next_root = math.ceil(root)
    
    # Return the next square number
    return next_root ** 2

# Example usage:
print(next_square_number(25))  # Output: 36
print(next_square_number(24))  # Output: 25
```

## Generated Output
```
36
25
```
