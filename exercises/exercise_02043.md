## Exercise
Create a function to retrieve the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_dict_value(dictionary, key):
    """

    example_dict = {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }

    key_to_find = "age"
    result = get_dict_value(example_dict, key_to_find)

    if result is not None:
        print(f"The value for key '{key_to_find}' is: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"No value found for key '{key_to_find}'")
