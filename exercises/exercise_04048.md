## Exercise
Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. If the dictionary is empty, return 'Dictionary is empty'.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_arbitrary_pair(input_dict):
    """
    This function takes a dictionary as input, removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair.
    
    If the dictionary is empty, it returns 'Dictionary is empty'.

    Args:
        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary.

    Returns:
        tuple: An arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary, or 'Dictionary is empty' if the dictionary is empty.
    """

    # First, we check if the dictionary is empty
    if not input_dict:
        
        # If the dictionary is empty, we return 'Dictionary is empty'
        return 'Dictionary is empty'

    # If the dictionary is not empty, we get a list of its keys
    keys = list(input_dict.keys())
    
    # We then select the first key in the list (this will be our arbitrary key)
    key = keys[0]
    
    # We get the value associated with the selected key
    value = input_dict[key]
    
    # We remove the key-value pair from the dictionary
    del input_dict[key]
    
    # Finally, we return the removed key-value pair as a tuple
    return key, value
```
