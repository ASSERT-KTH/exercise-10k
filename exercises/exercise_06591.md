## Exercise
Write a program to find the mode of all numbers in an array.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_mode(array):
    """
    Find the mode of all numbers in an array.

    Args:
        array (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all of them are returned.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each number in the array
    frequency = Counter(array)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())

    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency
    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]

    return modes

def main():
    # Example usage
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]
    modes = find_mode(array)
    print("Mode(s):", modes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mode(s): [4]
```
