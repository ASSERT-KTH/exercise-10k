## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the last index of the character in the string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def last_index_of_char(string, char):
    """
    This function finds the last index of a given character in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        char (str): The character to be searched.

    Returns:
        int: The last index of the character in the string. Returns -1 if the character is not found.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input string or character is not of type str.
        ValueError: If the input character is not of length 1.
    """

    # Check if the input string and character are of type str
    if not isinstance(string, str) or not isinstance(char, str):
        raise TypeError("Both string and character must be of type str.")

    # Check if the input character is of length 1
    if len(char) != 1:
        raise ValueError("The input character must be of length 1.")

    # Use the rfind method of the string class to find the last index of the character
    # The rfind method returns -1 if the character is not found
    last_index = string.rfind(char)

    # Return the last index of the character
    return last_index
```
