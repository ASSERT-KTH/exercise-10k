## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. Use if/else statements to determine the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
        
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        
        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        print(result)
        
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        while play_again not in ["yes", "no"]:
            play_again = input("Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: ").lower()
        if play_again == "no":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors

You win!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no):

    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
