## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a traffic light system. The program should take an integer input representing the current state of the traffic light (1 for red, 2 for yellow, 3 for green). Based on the current state, the program should print out the next state of the traffic light. If the current state is red, the next state should be green. If the current state is yellow, the next state should be red. If the current state is green, the next state should be yellow.

## Reference Solution
```python
def traffic_light(state):
    """
    Simulates a traffic light system by determining the next state based on the current state.

    Args:
        state (int): The current state of the traffic light (1 for red, 2 for yellow, 3 for green).

    Returns:
        int: The next state of the traffic light.
    """

    # First, we check if the input state is valid (i.e., it's either 1, 2, or 3)
    if state not in [1, 2, 3]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid state. State must be 1 (red), 2 (yellow), or 3 (green).")

    # Now, we determine the next state based on the current state
    # If the current state is red (1), the next state should be green (3)
    if state == 1:
        next_state = 3
    # If the current state is yellow (2), the next state should be red (1)
    elif state == 2:
        next_state = 1
    # If the current state is green (3), the next state should be yellow (2)
    else:
        next_state = 2

    # Finally, we return the next state
    return next_state


def main():
    # Get the current state from the user
    state = int(input("Enter the current state of the traffic light (1 for red, 2 for yellow, 3 for green): "))

    # Get the next state
    next_state = traffic_light(state)

    # Print the next state
    if next_state == 1:
        print("The next state of the traffic light is red.")
    elif next_state == 2:
        print("The next state of the traffic light is yellow.")
    else:
        print("The next state of the traffic light is green.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current state of the traffic light (1 for red, 2 for yellow, 3 for green): The next state of the traffic light is red.
```
