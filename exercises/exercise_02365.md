## Exercise
Write a program that demonstrates the use of the modulus operator to find the remainder of a division operation.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Calculate the quotient and remainder of a division operation.

    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided.
        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
    """
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder

def main():
    # Example usage
    dividend = 17
    divisor = 5
    quotient, remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)
    print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2
```
