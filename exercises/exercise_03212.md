## Exercise
Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and prints its area.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle.

    Args:
        base (float): The base of the triangle.
        height (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    return area

def main():
    # Get user input
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

    # Calculate and print the area
    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
    print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the base of the triangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp97ldyqzi.py", line 25, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp97ldyqzi.py", line 17, in main
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '5 6'
```
