## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the nth triangle number. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and sum them up.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_nth_triangle_number(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth triangle number.

    The nth triangle number is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    For example, the 5th triangle number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

    Args:
        n (int): The position of the triangle number to calculate.

    Returns:
        int: The nth triangle number.
    """
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0

    # Iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and sum them up
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i

    return total


# Example usage:
n = 5
result = calculate_nth_triangle_number(n)
print(f"The {n}th triangle number is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The 5th triangle number is: 15
```
