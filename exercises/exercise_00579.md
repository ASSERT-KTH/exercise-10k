    """
    # Convert the strings to sets for efficient lookup
    set1 = set(str1)
    set2 = set(str2)

    # Find the characters in set1 that are not in set2
    unique_chars = list(set1 - set2)

    return unique_chars

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    str1 = "hello"
    str2 = "world"
    print(find_unique_chars(str1, str2))
```
