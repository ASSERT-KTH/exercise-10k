## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number. Then, use a while loop to do the same.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Using a for loop
print("Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

# Using a while loop
print("\nPrinting numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop:")
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

## Generated Output
```
Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
