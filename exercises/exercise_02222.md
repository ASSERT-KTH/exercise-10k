## Exercise
Write a program that uses list comprehension to filter a list of numbers and return only the even numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a list of even numbers from the input list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of even integers.
    """
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
