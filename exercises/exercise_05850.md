## Exercise
Create a program that asks the user for a password and then checks if it meets the following conditions: The password must be at least 8 characters long, and it must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. Print out a message indicating whether the password is valid or not

## Reference Solution
```python
def validate_password(password):
    """
    Checks if the given password is valid.

    Args:
        password (str): The password to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False

    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
    has_uppercase = any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    has_lowercase = any(char.islower() for char in password)
    has_digit = any(char.isdigit() for char in password)

    return has_uppercase and has_lowercase and has_digit


def main():
    # Ask the user for a password
    password = input("Please enter a password: ")

    # Validate the password
    if validate_password(password):
        print("The password is valid.")
    else:
        print("The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following conditions:")
        print("- The password must be at least 8 characters long.")
        print("- The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
        print("- The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
        print("- The password must contain at least one digit.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
