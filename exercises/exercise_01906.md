## Exercise
Calculate the simple interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate the simple interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

    Args:
        principal (float): The principal amount
        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form)
        time (float): The time period (in years)

    Returns:
        float: The simple interest
    """
    interest = principal * rate * time
    return interest

# Example usage
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 2

interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)
print(f"The simple interest is: ${interest:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The simple interest is: $100.00
```
