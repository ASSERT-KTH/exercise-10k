## Exercise
Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input, checks if the age is a positive integer, and then prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is not a positive integer, the program should print an error message.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Program Description
# This program takes a user's name and age as input and prints out a greeting message.
# It checks if the age is a positive integer and handles invalid input accordingly.

# Section 1: Importing Modules
import math

# Section 2: Function to Check if a Number is a Positive Integer
def is_positive_integer(num):
    return isinstance(num, int) and num > 0

# Section 3: Main Program
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Section 4: Checking if Age is a Positive Integer
age = int(age)  # Convert age to an integer
if is_positive_integer(age):
    # Section 5: Printing Greeting Message
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
else:
    # Section 6: Printing Error Message
    print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your name: Enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp6tnre04c.py", line 14, in <module>
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
