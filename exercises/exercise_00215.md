## Exercise
Create a function that implements a simple number guessing game.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    """
    A simple number guessing game.
    
    The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
    The player has 6 attempts to guess the number.
    After each guess, the computer tells the player if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
    """

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    attempts = 0
    
    # Initialize the maximum number of attempts
    max_attempts = 6
    
    print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    print(f"Sorry, you didn't find the number. The number was {number_to_guess}.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Your guess is too low. Try again!
You have 5 attempts remaining.
Take a guess:
