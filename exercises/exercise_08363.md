## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their division result and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division result and remainder.
    
    Parameters:
    dividend (int): The number being divided.
    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the division result and remainder.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    
    return quotient, remainder

def main():
    # Get the numbers from the user
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
    
    # Divide the numbers and get the result and remainder
    try:
        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
        print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp70ugplnm.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp70ugplnm.py", line 22, in main
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
