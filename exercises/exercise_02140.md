## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a reduction function as input and returns a single value, which is the result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def reduce_list(input_list, reduction_function):
    """
    Applies a reduction function to all elements in a list.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list of elements to apply the reduction function to.
        reduction_function (function): A function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.

    Returns:
        The result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the list.
    """

    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not input_list:
        # If the list is empty, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message
        raise TypeError("reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value")

    # Initialize the result variable with the first element of the list
    # This will be used as the initial value for our reduction operation
    result = input_list[0]

    # Iterate over the rest of the list (from the second element to the end)
    for element in input_list[1:]:
        # Apply the reduction function to the current result and the current element
        # Update the result with the outcome of this operation
        result = reduction_function(result, element)

    # After iterating over the entire list, return the final result
    return result

# Example usage:
# Define a simple reduction function that adds two numbers
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the reduction function to the list
result = reduce_list(numbers, add)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

## Generated Output
```
15
```
