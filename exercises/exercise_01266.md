## Exercise
Write a program to filter a list and extract a subset of elements that meet a condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Filter a list and extract a subset of elements that meet a condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The input list to filter.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only the elements that meet the condition.
    """
    return [x for x in input_list if condition(x)]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter the list to get only the even numbers
even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Filter the list to get only the numbers greater than 5
large_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)
print(large_numbers)  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
