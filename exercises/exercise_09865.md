## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'Tie'
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return 'User'
    else:
        return 'Computer'

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user"""
    print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nUser choice: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer choice: {computer_choice}\n")
    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == 'Tie':
        print("It's a tie!")
    else:
        print(f"The {winner} wins!")

def main():
    play_again = 'y'
    while play_again.lower() == 'y':
        play_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
User choice: rock
Computer choice: scissors

The User wins!

Do you want to play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp9_guydmj.py", line 38, in main
    play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ")
