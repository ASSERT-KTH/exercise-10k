## Exercise
Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_operations(str1, str2):
    m = len(str1)
    n = len(str2)

    # Create a 2D array to store the Levenshtein distances
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Initialize the first row and column of the 2D array
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Fill in the rest of the 2D array
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])

    # Return the minimum number of operations
    return dp[m][n]
```

## Generated Output
```
Execution failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'
