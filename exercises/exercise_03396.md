## Exercise
Write a function to find the mode of a list of integers.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_mode(lst):
    """
    Find the mode of a list of integers.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all are returned.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each number
    counts = Counter(lst)

    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_count = max(counts.values())

    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency
    modes = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]

    return modes

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]
print(find_mode(numbers))  # Output: [4]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4]
```
