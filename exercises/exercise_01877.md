## Exercise
Write a program to search for multiple elements in an array and print their indices if found.

## Reference Solution
```python
def search_elements(array, elements):
    """
    Search for multiple elements in an array and print their indices if found.

    Args:
        array (list): The input array to search in.
        elements (list): The list of elements to search for.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    for element in elements:
        indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(array) if x == element]
        if indices:
            print(f"Element '{element}' found at indices: {indices}")
        else:
            print(f"Element '{element}' not found in the array.")

def main():
    # Example usage:
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3]
    elements = [2, 3, 10]
    search_elements(array, elements)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Element '2' found at indices: [1, 5, 11]
Element '3' found at indices: [2, 6, 12]
Element '10' not found in the array.
```
