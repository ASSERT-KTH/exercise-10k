## Exercise
Create a function that takes two functions as input and returns their composition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def compose_functions(f, g):
    """
    This function takes two functions as input and returns their composition.
    
    Args:
        f (function): The outer function in the composition.
        g (function): The inner function in the composition.
    
    Returns:
        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.
    """

    # We will use a lambda function to create the composition of f and g.
    # The lambda function takes an argument x and applies g to it first, then applies f to the result.
    # This is the definition of function composition in mathematics.
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    # A function that doubles its input.
    return 2 * x

def add_one(x):
    # A function that adds one to its input.
    return x + 1

# Compose the functions to create a new function that doubles and then adds one.
double_then_add_one = compose_functions(add_one, double)

# Test the composed function.
print(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 11
```

## Generated Output
```
11
```
