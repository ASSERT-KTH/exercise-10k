## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get the score from the user
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Determine the grade using conditional statements
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: Grade: B
```
