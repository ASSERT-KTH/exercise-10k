## Exercise
Create a program that looks up the meaning of a given word in a simple dictionary using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a dictionary with word meanings
dictionary = {
    "apple": "A sweet, juicy fruit.",
    "banana": "A long, curved fruit that is often yellow when ripe.",
    "cherry": "A small, round stone fruit that is often red or yellow.",
    "date": "A sweet, brown or reddish-brown fruit that grows on palm trees.",
    "elderberry": "A type of fruit that is often used to make jams and wines."
}

def look_up_word(word):
    # Convert the word to lowercase for case-insensitive lookup
    word = word.lower()

    # Check if the word is in the dictionary
    if word in dictionary:
        # If the word is found, return its meaning
        return dictionary[word]
    else:
        # If the word is not found, return a message indicating that
        return "Word not found in dictionary."

def main():
    # Get the word to look up from the user
    word = input("Enter a word to look up: ")

    # Look up the word and print its meaning
    meaning = look_up_word(word)
    print(meaning)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a word to look up: Word not found in dictionary.
```
