## Exercise
Write a program that checks the length of a given word and prints out whether it's short (less than 4 letters), medium (4-7 letters), or long (more than 7 letters) using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to check the length of a word
def check_word_length(word):
    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the word
    word = word.strip()
    
    # Check the length of the word and print a message accordingly
    if len(word) < 4:
        print(f"The word '{word}' is short.")
    elif 4 <= len(word) <= 7:
        print(f"The word '{word}' is medium.")
    elif len(word) > 7:
        print(f"The word '{word}' is long.")

# Call the function with a word as an argument
check_word_length("hello")
```

## Generated Output
```
The word 'hello' is medium.
```
