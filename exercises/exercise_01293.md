## Exercise
Create a function that takes a list of keys and a list of values, and returns a dictionary where each key is associated with the corresponding value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def create_dictionary(keys, values):
    """
    This function takes two lists, one for keys and one for values, 
    and returns a dictionary where each key is associated with the corresponding value.

    Args:
        keys (list): A list of keys.
        values (list): A list of values.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each key is associated with the corresponding value.
    """

    # First, we check if the lengths of the two lists are equal. 
    # If they are not, we raise a ValueError because we cannot create a dictionary with unequal number of keys and values.
    if len(keys) != len(values):
        raise ValueError("The number of keys and values must be equal.")

    # We initialize an empty dictionary to store our key-value pairs.
    result = {}

    # We use the zip function to iterate over the two lists in parallel.
    # The zip function returns an iterator of tuples, where the first item in each tuple is from the first list, 
    # the second item is from the second list, and so on.
    for key, value in zip(keys, values):
        # For each pair of key and value, we add them to our dictionary.
        result[key] = value

    # Finally, we return our dictionary.
    return result
```
