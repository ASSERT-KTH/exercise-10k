## Exercise
Write a program that allows two players to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the players' choices as input and print the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_player_choice(player_name):
    """Get the choice of a player."""
    while True:
        choice = input(f"{player_name}, enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").strip().capitalize()
        if choice in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            return choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the players' choices."""
    if player1_choice == player2_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player1_choice == "Rock" and player2_choice == "Scissors") or \
         (player1_choice == "Scissors" and player2_choice == "Paper") or \
         (player1_choice == "Paper" and player2_choice == "Rock"):
        return "Player 1 wins!"
    else:
        return "Player 2 wins!"

def main():
    """Main function."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    player1_name = input("Enter Player 1's name: ")
    player2_name = input("Enter Player 2's name: ")
    
    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name)
    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name)
    
    print(f"\n{player1_name} chose: {player1_choice}")
    print(f"{player2_name} chose: {player2_choice}\n")
    
    print(determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter Player 1's name: Enter Player 2's name: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpb2zw9vat.py", line 36, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpb2zw9vat.py", line 25, in main
    player2_name = input("Enter Player 2's name: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```
