## Exercise
Write a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage
def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of {numbers} is {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
