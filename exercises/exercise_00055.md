## Exercise
Find the first non-repeating character in a string

## Reference Solution
```python
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    """
    Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The first non-repeating character. If no such character exists, returns None.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character
    char_frequency = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_frequency:
            char_frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            char_frequency[char] = 1
    
    # Find the first non-repeating character
    for char in s:
        if char_frequency[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # If no non-repeating character exists, return None
    return None

# Example usage
s = "aabbc"
result = first_non_repeating_char(s)
if result:
    print(f"The first non-repeating character is: {result}")
else:
    print("No non-repeating character exists.")
