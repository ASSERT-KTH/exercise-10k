## Exercise
Write a program that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is prime, and false otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number is prime.

    Args:
    n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        # Check if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    # If the number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it is prime
    return True

def main():
    # Example usage
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a number: 23 is a prime number.
```
