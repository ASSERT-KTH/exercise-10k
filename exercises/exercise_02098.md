## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the variance of a set of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_variance(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the variance of a set of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The variance of the input numbers.
    """
    mean = np.mean(numbers)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return variance

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    print(f"The variance of the numbers {numbers} is {variance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The variance of the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.0
```
