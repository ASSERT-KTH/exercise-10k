## Exercise
Create a function that takes a variable number of arguments and prints their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_sum(*args):
    """
    This function takes a variable number of arguments, adds them up, and prints the sum.

    Args:
        *args: A variable number of arguments

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0. This will be used to store the sum of all the arguments.
    total_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each argument passed to the function.
    for arg in args:
        # Add the current argument to the total sum.
        total_sum += arg

    # Print the total sum after iterating over all arguments.
    print(total_sum)


# Test the function with some numbers.
# The function will print the sum of these numbers.
print_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
