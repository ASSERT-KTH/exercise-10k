## Exercise
Write a program that takes a name and age as input from the user and prints out a formatted string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_info():
    """Get user name and age from input"""
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.")
    return name, age

def print_user_info(name, age):
    """Print a formatted string with user information"""
    print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

def main():
    name, age = get_user_info()
    print_user_info(name, age)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your name: Please enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpbjbol5gi.py", line 21, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpbjbol5gi.py", line 17, in main
    name, age = get_user_info()
  File "/tmp/tmpbjbol5gi.py", line 6, in get_user_info
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
