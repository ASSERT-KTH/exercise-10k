## Exercise
Develop a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice."""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the game's rules."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'tie'
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return 'user'
    return 'computer'

def main():
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: ").lower()
        if user_choice == 'q':
            break
        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")

        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        if winner == 'tie':
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif winner == 'user':
            print("You win!")
        else:
            print("Computer wins!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: rock

Both players selected rock. It's a tie!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit:
