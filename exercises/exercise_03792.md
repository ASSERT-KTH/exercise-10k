## Exercise
Write a function to rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rotate_image(image):
    """
    Rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise.

    Args:
        image (list): A 2D list representing the image.

    Returns:
        list: The rotated image.
    """
    # Transpose the image (swap rows and columns)
    transposed_image = list(zip(*image))
    
    # Reverse each row to achieve the clockwise rotation
    rotated_image = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_image]
    
    return rotated_image

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define an example image
    image = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    
    # Rotate the image
    rotated_image = rotate_image(image)
    
    # Print the original and rotated images
    print("Original Image:")
    for row in image:
        print(row)
    
    print("\nRotated Image:")
    for row in rotated_image:
        print(row)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original Image:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Rotated Image:
[7, 4, 1]
[8, 5, 2]
[9, 6, 3]
```
