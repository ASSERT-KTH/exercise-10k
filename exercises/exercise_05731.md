## Exercise
Write a function that takes a function and a list as arguments and applies the function to each element in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def apply_function(func, lst):
    """
    Applies a given function to each element in a list.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to be applied.
        lst (list): The list whose elements will be transformed by the function.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with the results of applying the function to each element in the input list.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of applying the function to each element.
    result = []

    # Iterate over each element in the input list.
    for element in lst:
        # Apply the function to the current element and append the result to the result list.
        result.append(func(element))

    # Return the result list.
    return result

# Example usage:
# Define a simple function that squares its input.
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Create a list of numbers.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the square function to each number in the list.
squares = apply_function(square, numbers)

# Print the result.
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Generated Output
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
