## Exercise
Write a function that uses the socket module to establish a TCP connection and send/receive data.

## Reference Solution
```python
import socket

def start_server():
    # Create a socket object
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server address and port
    server_address = ('localhost', 12345)

    # Bind the socket to the server address and port
    server_socket.bind(server_address)

    # Listen for incoming connections
    server_socket.listen(1)

    print(f"Server listening on {server_address[0]}:{server_address[1]}")

    while True:
        # Wait for a connection
        print("Waiting for a connection...")
        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {client_address}")

        # Receive data from the client
        while True:
            data = connection.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            print(f"Received from client: {data.decode()}")

            # Send response back to the client
            response = f"Server received: {data.decode()}"
            connection.sendall(response.encode())

        # Close the connection
        connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()
```

```python
import socket

def start_client():
    # Create a socket object
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define the server address and port
    server_address = ('localhost', 12345)

    # Connect to the server
    client_socket.connect(server_address)

    print(f"Connected to {server_address[0]}:{server_address[1]}")

    # Send data to the server
    while True:
        message = input("Enter message to send to the server (or 'quit' to exit): ")
        if message.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        client_socket.sendall(message.encode())

        # Receive response from the server
        response = client_socket.recv(1024)
        print(f"Received from server: {response.decode()}")

    # Close the connection
    client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_client()
```
