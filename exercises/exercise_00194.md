## Exercise
Create a program that uses a nested for loop to sort a list of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def bubble_sort(numbers):
    """
    Sorts a list of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of numbers.
    """
    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(numbers)

    # Iterate over the list
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Traverse the list from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:
                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]

    return numbers


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    print("Original list:", numbers)
    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
    print("Sorted list:", sorted_numbers)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Original list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
