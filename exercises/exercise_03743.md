## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print("The sum of the numbers is:", result)
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum(numbers)
print("The sum of the numbers is:", result)
```

## Generated Output
```
The sum of the numbers is: 15
```
