## Exercise
Create a function that finds the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window(s, t):
    """
    Find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.

    Args:
    s (str): The string to search for the minimum window substring.
    t (str): The string containing the characters to search for.

    Returns:
    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. If no such substring exists, returns an empty string.
    """
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in string t
    t_count = defaultdict(int)
    for char in t:
        t_count[char] += 1

    # Initialize the required character count to the length of string t
    required_chars = len(t_count)

    # Initialize the left and right pointers
    left = 0

    # Initialize the minimum window substring and its length
    min_window = ""
    min_window_len = float('inf')

    # Initialize the formed character count to 0
    formed_chars = 0

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in the current window
    window_counts = defaultdict(int)

    # Iterate over the string s
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add the character at the right pointer to the window counts
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] += 1

        # If the character is in t_count and its frequency in the window is equal to its frequency in t_count, increment the formed_chars count
        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:
            formed_chars += 1

        # While the window contains all characters of t and the left pointer is less than the right pointer
        while left <= right and formed_chars == required_chars:
            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_window_len:
                min_window = s[left:right + 1]
                min_window_len = right - left + 1

            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counts
            character = s[left]
            window_counts[character] -= 1

            # If the character is in t_count and its frequency in the window is less than its frequency in t_count, decrement the formed_chars count
            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:
                formed_chars -= 1

            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1

    # Return the minimum window substring
    return min_window

# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(min_window(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## Generated Output
```
BANC
```
