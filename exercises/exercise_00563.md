## Exercise
Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of the second string removed from the first string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_string(main_str, str_to_remove):
    """
    This function takes two strings as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of the second string removed from the first string.

    Args:
        main_str (str): The original string.
        str_to_remove (str): The string to be removed from the original string.

    Returns:
        str: A new string with all occurrences of str_to_remove removed from main_str.
    """

    # We will use the replace method of the string class in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring.
    # In this case, we want to replace str_to_remove with an empty string, effectively removing it from main_str.
    
    # First, we check if the string to be removed is not empty, because replacing an empty string would result in an empty string being inserted between every character in the main string.
    if str_to_remove != "":

        # Now we use the replace method to replace all occurrences of str_to_remove with an empty string.
        # The result is stored in a new variable, new_str, to avoid modifying the original string.
        new_str = main_str.replace(str_to_remove, "")

        # Finally, we return the new string with all occurrences of str_to_remove removed.
        return new_str

    # If the string to be removed is empty, we simply return the original string, because there's nothing to remove.
    else:
        return main_str
```
