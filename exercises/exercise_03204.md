## Exercise
Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and prints its area and perimeter.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def area(l, w):
    return l * w

# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
def perimeter(l, w):
    return 2 * (l + w)

# Main program
l = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
w = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area and perimeter
a = area(l, w)
p = perimeter(l, w)

# Print the results
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {a}")
print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {p}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpb5_drq8b.py", line 10, in <module>
    l = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '4 5'
```
