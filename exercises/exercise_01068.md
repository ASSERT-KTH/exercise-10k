## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    float: The average of the list of numbers.
    """
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of the list {numbers} is: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return None  # or any other default value
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is: 3.0
```
