## Exercise
Write a program that allows two players to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the choices of both players as input and print the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
def rock_paper_scissors():
    """
    Simulate a Rock, Paper, Scissors game between two players.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding indices
    choices = {
        "rock": 0,
        "paper": 1,
        "scissors": 2
    }

    # Get the choices of both players
    player1_choice = input("Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    player2_choice = input("Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()

    # Check if the choices are valid
    if player1_choice not in choices or player2_choice not in choices:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        return rock_paper_scissors()

    # Determine the winner based on the game's rules
    if player1_choice == player2_choice:
        print("It's a tie!")
    elif (player1_choice == "rock" and player2_choice == "scissors") or \
         (player1_choice == "paper" and player2_choice == "rock") or \
         (player1_choice == "scissors" and player2_choice == "paper"):
        print("Player 1 wins!")
    else:
        print("Player 2 wins!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rock_paper_scissors()
```

## Generated Output
```
Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
