## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their least common multiple.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.
    """
    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2
    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)
    
    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)
    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd
    
    return lcm

def main():
    # Get user input
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Calculate and print the LCM
    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpqlfveopk.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpqlfveopk.py", line 24, in main
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12 15'
```
