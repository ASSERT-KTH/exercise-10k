## Exercise
Write a program that takes a series of numbers as input and returns their average.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of {numbers} is {average}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
```
