## Exercise
Write a program that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all elements that are in either array.

## Reference Solution
```python
import numpy as np

def union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Returns a new array containing all unique elements from both input arrays.

    Parameters:
    arr1 (numpy.ndarray): The first input array.
    arr2 (numpy.ndarray): The second input array.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: A new array containing all unique elements from both input arrays.
    """
    # Use numpy's union1d function to get the union of the two arrays
    union_arr = np.union1d(arr1, arr2)
    
    return union_arr

# Example usage:
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

result = union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
```
