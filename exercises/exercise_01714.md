## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a chatbot, where users can have a conversation with the chatbot until they choose to quit.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to handle user input
def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit the conversation.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            print("Chatbot: It was nice talking to you!")
            break
        elif user_input.lower() == 'hello':
            print("Chatbot: Hi there! How can I assist you today?")
        elif user_input.lower() == 'how are you':
            print("Chatbot: I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How about you?")
        else:
            print("Chatbot: Sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?")

# Call the chatbot function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit the conversation.
You: Chatbot: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
You: Chatbot: Sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?
You: Chatbot: It was nice talking to you!
```
