## Exercise
Write a function that takes in a graph and returns True if it's connected, False otherwise.

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import deque

def is_graph_connected(graph):
    """
    Checks if a graph is connected.

    Args:
    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the graph is connected, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the graph is empty
    if not graph:
        return False

    # Choose an arbitrary node to start with
    start_node = next(iter(graph))

    # Create a set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set()

    # Create a queue for BFS, enqueue the start node
    queue = deque([start_node])

    # Mark the start node as visited
    visited.add(start_node)

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()

        # For each neighbor of the current node
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            # If the neighbor has not been visited yet
            if neighbor not in visited:
                # Mark it as visited and enqueue it
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # If all nodes have been visited, the graph is connected
    return len(visited) == len(graph)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a connected graph
    connected_graph = {
        'A': ['B', 'C'],
        'B': ['A', 'D'],
        'C': ['A', 'D'],
        'D': ['B', 'C']
    }

    # Define a disconnected graph
    disconnected_graph = {
        'A': ['B'],
        'B': ['A'],
        'C': ['D'],
        'D': ['C']
    }

    print(is_graph_connected(connected_graph))  # Output: True
    print(is_graph_connected(disconnected_graph))  # Output: False
```

## Generated Output
```
True
False
```
