## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer"""
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    """Get the user's choice and validate it"""
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").strip().title()
        if user_choice in ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]:
            return user_choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "Tie"
    if (user_choice == "Rock" and computer_choice == "Scissors") or \
       (user_choice == "Paper" and computer_choice == "Rock") or \
       (user_choice == "Scissors" and computer_choice == "Paper"):
        return "User"
    return "Computer"

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors"""
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    if winner == "Tie":
        print("It's a tie!")
    else:
        print(f"The {winner} wins!")

def main():
    """Main function to play the game"""
    play_again = "y"
    while play_again.lower() == "y":
        play_game()
        play_again = input("Play again? (y/n): ")
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): 
You chose: Rock
Computer chose: Rock

It's a tie!
Play again? (y/n): 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp621tlzbb.py", line 47, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp621tlzbb.py", line 43, in main
    play_again = input("Play again? (y/n): ")
