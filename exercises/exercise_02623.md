## Exercise
Write a program that takes a name, location, and object as input and generates a short story.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def generate_short_story(name, location, object):
    """
    Generates a short story based on the input parameters.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the main character.
        location (str): The location of the story.
        object (str): The object that plays a key role in the story.

    Returns:
        str: The generated short story.
    """
    story_templates = [
        f"In the bustling city of {location}, {name} stumbled upon a mysterious {object} that changed their life forever.",
        f"{name} had always been fascinated by the {object} they found in the {location}, and soon discovered its hidden powers.",
        f"After moving to {location}, {name} found a {object} that became their most prized possession and brought them good fortune.",
        f"{name} went on a quest to find the legendary {object} in {location}, and encountered many challenges along the way.",
        f"In the heart of {location}, {name} discovered a {object} that held the key to unlocking a long-forgotten secret."
    ]

    return random.choice(story_templates)

def main():
    name = input("Enter a name: ")
    location = input("Enter a location: ")
    object = input("Enter an object: ")

    short_story = generate_short_story(name, location, object)
    print("Generated Short Story:")
    print(short_story)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a name: Enter a location: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpr35yjz15.py", line 35, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpr35yjz15.py", line 27, in main
    location = input("Enter a location: ")
