## Exercise
Write a program that takes the user's choice as input and determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Return the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    """Play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game"""
    print("Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!")
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'quit' to exit: ").lower()
        if user_choice == 'quit':
            break
        elif user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'quit' to exit: 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: paper

Computer wins!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'quit' to exit:
