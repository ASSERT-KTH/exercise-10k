## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of lists as input, transposes the list of lists, and returns the transposed list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def transpose_list_of_lists(list_of_lists):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input, transposes the list of lists, 
    and returns the transposed list.

    Args:
        list_of_lists (list): A list containing lists.

    Returns:
        list: The transposed list of lists.
    """

    # First, we check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not isinstance(list_of_lists, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    # Then, we check if all elements in the list are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.
    if not all(isinstance(sublist, list) for sublist in list_of_lists):
        raise TypeError("All elements in the list must be lists")

    # We use the built-in zip function to transpose the list of lists. The zip function 
    # returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from 
    # each of the argument sequences or iterables. By using the * operator, we unpack the 
    # list of lists into separate arguments for the zip function.
    transposed_list = zip(*list_of_lists)

    # Since the zip function returns an iterator, we convert it back to a list of lists.
    # We use a list comprehension to convert each tuple in the iterator to a list.
    transposed_list = [list(row) for row in transposed_list]

    # Finally, we return the transposed list of lists.
    return transposed_list

# Example usage:
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(transpose_list_of_lists(list_of_lists))  # Output: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```

## Generated Output
```
[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```
