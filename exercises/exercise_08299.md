## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the logarithm of a number.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_logarithm(number, base):
    """
    Calculate the logarithm of a number with a specified base.

    Args:
        number (float): The number to calculate the logarithm of.
        base (float): The base of the logarithm.

    Returns:
        float: The logarithm of the number with the specified base.
    """
    if number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be greater than zero")
    if base <= 0 or base == 1:
        raise ValueError("Base must be greater than zero and not equal to one")

    return math.log(number, base)

def main():
    # Example usage
    number = 100
    base = 10
    result = calculate_logarithm(number, base)
    print(f"The logarithm of {number} with base {base} is {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The logarithm of 100 with base 10 is 2.0
```
