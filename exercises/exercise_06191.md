## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the string with the specified character removed from the beginning and end.

## Reference Solution
```python
def remove_char(s, c):
    """
    This function removes the specified character from the beginning and end of a given string.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string.
    c (str): The character to be removed.

    Returns:
    str: The string with the specified character removed from the beginning and end.
    """

    # We will use a while loop to continuously remove the character from the start of the string until it's no longer there
    while s and s[0] == c:
        # If the string is not empty and the first character is the one we want to remove, we remove it
        s = s[1:]

    # We will use another while loop to continuously remove the character from the end of the string until it's no longer there
    while s and s[-1] == c:
        # If the string is not empty and the last character is the one we want to remove, we remove it
        s = s[:-1]

    # Finally, we return the modified string
    return s
