## Exercise
Create a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Three'. If it is divisible by 5, print 'Five'. If it is divisible by both, print 'ThreeFive'. If it is not divisible by either, print 'None'.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    bool isDivisibleBy3 = n % 3 == 0;
    bool isDivisibleBy5 = n % 5 == 0;

    if (isDivisibleBy3) {
        std::cout << "Three";
    }

    if (isDivisibleBy5) {
        if (isDivisibleBy3) {
            std::cout << "Five";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Five";
        }
    }

    if (!isDivisibleBy3 && !isDivisibleBy5) {
        std::cout << "None";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
