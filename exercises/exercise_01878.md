## Exercise
Write a program to filter a list based on multiple conditions and print the filtered list.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a list of dictionaries
people = [
    {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"},
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "San Francisco"},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "New York"},
    {"name": "Mary", "age": 20, "city": "Chicago"},
    {"name": "David", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
]

# Define the conditions
age_condition = 25
city_condition = "New York"

# Filter the list based on the conditions
filtered_people = [person for person in people if person["age"] == age_condition and person["city"] == city_condition]

# Print the filtered list
print("Filtered List:")
for person in filtered_people:
    print(person)
```

## Generated Output
```
Filtered List:
{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```
