## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

## Reference Solution
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is a negative number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
