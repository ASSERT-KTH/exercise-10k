## Exercise
Create a program that takes in the price of an item and the discount percentage, then calculates the discount amount and prints out the final price. If the discount percentage is greater than 20, print a warning message

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculates the discount amount and final price.

    Args:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item.
        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the discount amount and final price.
    """
    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price
    final_price = original_price - discount_amount
    return discount_amount, final_price

def main():
    original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: $"))
    discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage (%): "))

    discount_amount, final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)

    print(f"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Final price: ${final_price:.2f}")

    if discount_percentage > 20:
        print("Warning: Discount percentage is greater than 20.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
