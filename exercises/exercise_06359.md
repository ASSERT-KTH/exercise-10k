## Exercise
Explain the concept of idempotent operations and provide examples of idempotent operations on variables.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Assignment is idempotent
x = 5
x = 5  # does not change the value of x
print(x)  # prints 5

# Bitwise AND with itself is idempotent
x = 0b1010
x = x & x  # does not change the value of x
print(bin(x))  # prints 0b1010

# Bitwise OR with 0 is idempotent
x = 0b1010
x = x | 0  # does not change the value of x
print(bin(x))  # prints 0b1010

# Setting a flag is idempotent
flag = True
flag = True  # does not change the value of flag
print(flag)  # prints True
```

## Generated Output
```
5
0b1010
0b1010
True
```
