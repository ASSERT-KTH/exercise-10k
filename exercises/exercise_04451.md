## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on user input. The user should be able to choose the starting number, ending number, and increment.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(start, end, increment):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers from start to end with the given increment.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.
        end (int): The ending number of the sequence.
        increment (int): The increment between each number in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.
    """
    sequence = []
    current = start
    while current <= end:
        sequence.append(current)
        current += increment
    return sequence

def main():
    # Get user input
    start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
    end = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))
    increment = int(input("Enter the increment: "))

    # Generate the sequence
    sequence = generate_sequence(start, end, increment)

    # Print the sequence
    print("Sequence:")
    for num in sequence:
        print(num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the starting number: Enter the ending number: Enter the increment: Sequence:
1
3
5
7
9
```
