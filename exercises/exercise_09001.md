    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        char (str): The character to count.

    Returns:
        int: The count of the character in the string.
    """
    return string.count(char)

# Example usage:
def main():
    string = "Hello, World!"
    char = "l"
    count = count_char(string, char)
    print(f"The character '{char}' appears {count} times in the string.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
