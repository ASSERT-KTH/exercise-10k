## Exercise
Write a function to perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

## Reference Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def topological_sort(graph):
    """
    Performs a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

    Args:
    graph: A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.

    Returns:
    A list of nodes in topological order.
    """
    # Initialize the in-degree dictionary
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] += 1

    # Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if in_degree[node] == 0])

    # Initialize the result list
    result = []

    # Perform the topological sort
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Check for cycles
    if len(result) != len(graph):
        raise ValueError("Graph contains a cycle")

    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': ['B', 'C'],
        'B': ['D', 'E'],
        'C': ['F'],
        'D': [],
        'E': ['F'],
        'F': []
    }

    sorted_nodes = topological_sort(graph)
    print("Topological order:", sorted_nodes)
```

## Generated Output
```
Topological order: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```
