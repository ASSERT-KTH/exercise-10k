## Exercise
Write a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to a given number. Use the function to double a number.

## Reference Solution
```python
# First, we define a higher-order function that takes another function and a number as arguments.
def apply_function(func, num):
    """
    Applies a given function to a number.

    Args:
        func (function): The function to be applied.
        num (int or float): The number to which the function is applied.

    Returns:
        result: The result of applying the function to the number.
    """
    
    # We then apply the given function to the number and return the result.
    return func(num)

# Next, we define a function that doubles a number.
def double(x):
    """
    Doubles a given number.

    Args:
        x (int or float): The number to be doubled.

    Returns:
        int or float: The double of the given number.
    """
    
    # We simply return the number multiplied by 2.
    return x * 2

# Finally, we use the higher-order function to double a number.
print(apply_function(double, 5))  # Outputs: 10
```

## Generated Output
```
10
```
