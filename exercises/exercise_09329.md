## Exercise
Write a program to demonstrate variable reassignment.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a variable and assign it a value
x = 10
print("Initial value of x:", x)

# Reassign the variable to a new value
x = 20
print("Value of x after reassignment:", x)

# Reassign the variable to a different data type
x = "Hello, World!"
print("Value of x after reassignment to string:", x)

# Reassign the variable to a list
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Value of x after reassignment to list:", x)
```

## Generated Output
```
Initial value of x: 10
Value of x after reassignment: 20
Value of x after reassignment to string: Hello, World!
Value of x after reassignment to list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
