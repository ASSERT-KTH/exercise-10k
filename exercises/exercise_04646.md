## Exercise
Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. If the person is 18 or older, they are eligible to vote. If the person is under 18, they are not eligible to vote.

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility(age):
    """
    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

    Args:
        age (int): The person's age.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the person is eligible to vote or not.
    """
    if age >= 18:
        return "You are eligible to vote."
    else:
        return "You are not eligible to vote."

def main():
    # Get the person's age from the user
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

    # Check voting eligibility
    eligibility_message = check_voting_eligibility(age)

    # Print the result
    print(eligibility_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
