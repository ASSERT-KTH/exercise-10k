## Exercise
Write a program to partition a list into two or more sublists based on a condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def partition_list(input_list, condition):
    """
    Partitions a list into two sublists based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: A list of sublists where the first sublist contains elements that satisfy the condition,
              and the second sublist contains elements that do not satisfy the condition.
    """
    true_list = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]
    false_list = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]
    return [true_list, false_list]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

result = partition_list(numbers, is_even)
print("Even numbers:", result[0])
print("Odd numbers:", result[1])
```

```python
def partition_list_into_multiple_sublists(input_list, condition):
    """
    Partitions a list into multiple sublists based on a given condition.

    Args:
        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.
        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a value that will be used as a key in the dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the possible outcomes of the condition and the values are the corresponding sublists.
    """
    result = {}
    for element in input_list:
        key = condition(element)
        if key not in result:
            result[key] = []
        result[key].append(element)
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
def get_remainder(num):
    return num % 3

result = partition_list_into_multiple_sublists(numbers, get_remainder)
for key, value in result.items():
    print(f"Numbers with remainder {key} when divided by 3:", value)
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
def is_even_or_greater_than_5(num):
    return num % 2 == 0 or num > 5

result = partition_list(numbers, is_even_or_greater_than_5)
print("Numbers that are even or greater than 5:", result[0])
print("Numbers that are neither even nor greater than 5:", result[1])
```

## Generated Output
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
