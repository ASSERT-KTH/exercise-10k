## Exercise
Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change

## Reference Solution
```python
def min_coins(coins, amount):
    """
    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change.

    Args:
    coins (list): A list of coin denominations.
    amount (int): The target amount.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of coins needed.
    """
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # We need 0 coins to make 0 units of change

    # Iterate over each coin denomination
    for c in coins:
        # Iterate over each amount from c to amount
        for i in range(c, amount + 1):
            # Update dp[i] if we can make i units of change with fewer coins
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)

    # Return the minimum number of coins needed
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11
print(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
```
3
```
