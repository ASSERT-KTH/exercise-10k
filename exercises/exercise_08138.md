## Exercise
Create a program that implements a simple chatbot using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the required libraries
import random

# Define a function to get the user's response
def get_response(user_input):
    """
    This function takes the user's input and returns the chatbot's response.
    """
    # Convert the user's input to lowercase for easier comparison
    user_input = user_input.lower()

    # Check for greetings
    if "hello" in user_input or "hi" in user_input:
        return "Hello! How are you today?"
    elif "hey" in user_input:
        return "Hey! What's up?"

    # Check for name inquiry
    elif "what is your name" in user_input or "name" in user_input:
        return "My name is ChatBot. Nice to meet you!"

    # Check for fun facts
    elif "tell me a fact" in user_input or "fact" in user_input:
        facts = [
            "The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896, and lasted only 38 minutes.",
            "The longest word in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine particles of silica.",
            "The Great Barrier Reef is the biggest structure made by living organisms and can be seen from space."
        ]
        return random.choice(facts)

    # Check for goodbye
    elif "bye" in user_input or "goodbye" in user_input:
        return "Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you."

    # Default response
    else:
        return "I didn't understand that. Please try again!"

# Main function
def main():
    print("Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "quit":
            break
        print("ChatBot:", get_response(user_input))

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
You: ChatBot: Hello! How are you today?
You: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpf1wl_udz.py", line 50, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpf1wl_udz.py", line 43, in main
    user_input = input("You: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
