## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the user is under 18, print 'You are not eligible to vote'; if the user is 18 or older, print 'You are eligible to vote'

## Reference Solution
```python
def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Ask the user for their age
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")

    # Check if the input is a valid integer
    while not age.isdigit():
        age = input("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age: ")

    # Convert the input to an integer
    age = int(age)

    # Check the voting eligibility
    if age < 18:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()
```

## Generated Output
