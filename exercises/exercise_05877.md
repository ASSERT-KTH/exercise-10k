## Exercise
Determine whether a given number is prime or not.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """
    Determine whether a given number is prime or not.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for num in numbers:
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f"{num} is prime")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not prime")
```

## Generated Output
```
2 is prime
3 is prime
4 is not prime
5 is prime
6 is not prime
7 is prime
8 is not prime
9 is not prime
10 is not prime
```
