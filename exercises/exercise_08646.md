## Exercise
Write a function that counts the occurrences of a given element in a given list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_occurrences(lst, elem):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of a given element in a given list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to search in.
        elem: The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the element in the list.
    """

    # Initialize a counter variable to store the count of occurrences
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for i in lst:
        
        # Check if the current element matches the given element
        if i == elem:
            
            # If it matches, increment the counter
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return count

# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]
elem = 2
print(count_occurrences(lst, elem))  # Output: 3
```

## Generated Output
