    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
