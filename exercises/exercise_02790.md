## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given array.

## Reference Solution
```python
import statistics

def calculate_statistics(array):
    """
    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a given array.

    Args:
        array (list): The input array.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode of the array.
    """

    # Calculate the mean
    mean = statistics.mean(array)

    # Calculate the median
    median = statistics.median(array)

    # Calculate the mode
    try:
        mode = statistics.mode(array)
    except statistics.StatisticsError:
        # If there is not exactly one most common value, calculate all modes
        mode = statistics.multimode(array)

    return {
        "mean": mean,
        "median": median,
        "mode": mode
    }

# Example usage:
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]
stats = calculate_statistics(array)

print("Mean:", stats["mean"])
print("Median:", stats["median"])
print("Mode:", stats["mode"])
```

## Generated Output
```
Mean: 3.625
Median: 4.0
Mode: 5
```
