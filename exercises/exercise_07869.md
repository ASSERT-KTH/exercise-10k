## Exercise
Write a program that generates a sequence of numbers using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(n):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the following rules:
    - If the number is even, the next number is the current number divided by 2.
    - If the number is odd, the next number is the current number multiplied by 3 and then added by 1.
    """
    sequence = [n]
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = n * 3 + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    return sequence

# Example usage
n = 10
print("Sequence starting from", n, ":", generate_sequence(n))
```

## Generated Output
```
Sequence starting from 10 : [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
```
