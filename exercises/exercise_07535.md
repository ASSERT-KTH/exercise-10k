## Exercise
You are given a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):
    """
    Calculate the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.

    Args:
        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.
    """

    average_grades = {}

    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary
    for student, subjects in grades_dict.items():
        # Initialize sum of grades and count of subjects for the current student
        total_grade = 0
        subject_count = 0

        # Iterate over each subject and grade for the current student
        for subject, grade in subjects.items():
            # Add the grade to the total and increment the subject count
            total_grade += grade
            subject_count += 1

        # Calculate the average grade for the current student
        if subject_count > 0:
            average_grade = total_grade / subject_count
        else:
            average_grade = 0  # or any other default value if a student has no subjects

        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary
        average_grades[student] = average_grade

    return average_grades


# Example usage
grades_dict = {
    "John": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78},
    "Alice": {"Math": 92, "Science": 88, "English": 95},
    "Bob": {"Math": 76, "Science": 82, "English": 89}
}

average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)
print(average_grades)
```

```python
{
    'John': 84.33333333333333, 
    'Alice': 91.66666666666667, 
    'Bob': 82.33333333333333
}
```

## Generated Output
```
{'John': 84.33333333333333, 'Alice': 91.66666666666667, 'Bob': 82.33333333333333}
```
