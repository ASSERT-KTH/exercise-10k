## Exercise
Create a program to calculate the average of all numbers in a list using a basic algorithm

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(num_list):
    """
    Calculate the average of all numbers in a list.

    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of all numbers in the list.
    """
    total = 0  # Initialize the total sum to 0
    count = 0  # Initialize the count of numbers to 0

    # Iterate through the list
    for num in num_list:
        total += num  # Add each number to the total
        count += 1  # Increment the count

    # Check if the list is not empty
    if count == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        average = total / count  # Calculate the average
        return average

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("Average:", average)
```

## Generated Output
```
Average: 3.0
```
