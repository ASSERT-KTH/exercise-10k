## Exercise
Write a program that implements ternary search using a while loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def ternary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Ternary search function to find an element in a sorted array.

    Args:
    arr (list): A sorted list of integers.
    target (int): The target element to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.
    """
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        # Calculate the two mid points
        mid1 = left + (right - left) // 3
        mid2 = right - (right - left) // 3

        # Check if the target is at the first mid point
        if arr[mid1] == target:
            return mid1

        # Check if the target is at the second mid point
        if arr[mid2] == target:
            return mid2

        # If the target is less than the first mid point, update the right pointer
        if target < arr[mid1]:
            right = mid1 - 1

        # If the target is greater than the second mid point, update the left pointer
        elif target > arr[mid2]:
            left = mid2 + 1

        # If the target is between the two mid points, update the left and right pointers
        else:
            left = mid1 + 1
            right = mid2 - 1

    # If the target is not found, return -1
    return -1


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    target = 5
    index = ternary_search(arr, target)

    if index != -1:
        print(f"Target {target} found at index {index}.")
    else:
        print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Target 5 found at index 4.
```
