## Exercise
Create a function called organize_data that takes in a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the list and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. The function should also handle cases where the input list is empty, in which case it should return an empty dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def organize_data(data):
    """
    This function takes in a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the list 
    and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list.

    Args:
        data (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with integers as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each integer.
    frequency_dict = {}

    # Check if the input list is not empty.
    if data:
        # Iterate over each integer in the input list.
        for num in data:
            # If the integer is already a key in the dictionary, increment its value by 1.
            if num in frequency_dict:
                # Increment the value by 1.
                frequency_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                # If the integer is not a key in the dictionary, add it with a value of 1.
                frequency_dict[num] = 1

    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each integer.
    return frequency_dict
```
