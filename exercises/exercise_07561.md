## Exercise
Create a function that returns another function, which has access to the outer function's scope.

## Reference Solution
```python
# We start by defining our outer function. This function will return another function.
def outer_function(outer_variable):
    """
    This function returns another function, which has access to the outer function's scope.

    Args:
        outer_variable (str): A variable from the outer function's scope.

    Returns:
        function: A function that has access to the outer function's scope.
    """

    # Now, we define our inner function. This function will have access to the outer function's scope.
    def inner_function(inner_variable):
        # We can use the outer_variable inside the inner function, even though it's not defined here.
        # This is because the inner function has access to the outer function's scope.
        print(f"Outer variable: {outer_variable}")
        print(f"Inner variable: {inner_variable}")

    # Finally, we return the inner function from the outer function.
    return inner_function

# Example usage:
# We call the outer function with an argument, and store the returned function in a variable.
returned_function = outer_function("Hello, world!")

# Now, we can call the returned function with its own argument.
returned_function("This is the inner variable.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Outer variable: Hello, world!
Inner variable: This is the inner variable.
```
