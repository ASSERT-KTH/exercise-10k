## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one to calculate the area and another to calculate the perimeter. The program should then call these functions with the provided length and width to print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle

# Problem: Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
# The program should have two functions: one to calculate the area and another to calculate the perimeter.
# The program should then call these functions with the provided length and width to print the results.

# Solution:
def areaRectangle(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def perimeterRectangle(length, width):
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return perimeter

# Main Program
length = 5
width = 7
area = areaRectangle(length, width)
perimeter = perimeterRectangle(length, width)

print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Area: 35
Perimeter: 24
```
