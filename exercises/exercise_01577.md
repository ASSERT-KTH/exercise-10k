## Exercise
Write a function that uses the filter function to filter a list of numbers and return the numbers that satisfy a given condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
    """
    This function filters a list of numbers based on a given condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be filtered.
        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns True or False.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the given condition.
    """

    # First, we need to define the function that we will use as the condition for filtering
    # In this case, we will use the condition function passed as an argument

    # Then, we use the filter function to filter the list of numbers
    # The filter function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable
    # It returns an iterator that yields the items from the iterable for which the function returns True
    filtered_numbers = filter(condition, numbers)

    # Finally, we convert the iterator returned by the filter function to a list
    # This is because the problem statement asks for a list as output
    # We use the list function to convert the iterator to a list
    result = list(filtered_numbers)

    # Now, we return the list of numbers that satisfy the given condition
    return result


# Example usage:
# Define a condition function
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Filter the list of numbers using the condition function
filtered_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)

# Print the filtered list of numbers
print(filtered_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6]
```
