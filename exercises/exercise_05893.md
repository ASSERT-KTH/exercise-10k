## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists.

## Reference Solution
```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists.

    Args:
        nested_list (list): A list of lists.

    Returns:
        list: A single list containing all elements from the sublists.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []

    # Iterate over each sublist in the nested list
    for sublist in nested_list:
        # For each sublist, iterate over each element in the sublist
        for element in sublist:
            # Append each element to the result list
            result.append(element)

    # Return the result list
    return result

# Alternatively, you can use list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way
def flatten_list_comprehension(nested_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists.

    Args:
        nested_list (list): A list of lists.

    Returns:
        list: A single list containing all elements from the sublists.
    """

    # Use list comprehension to create a new list containing all elements from the sublists
    return [element for sublist in nested_list for element in sublist]
```
