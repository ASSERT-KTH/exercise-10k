## Exercise
Write a program that takes a list and a mapping function as input, and returns a new list containing the results of applying the mapping function to each element of the original list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def map_list(lst, func):
    """
    Applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list containing the results.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.
        func (function): The function to apply to each element.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing the results of applying the function to each element.
    """
    result = []
    for i in lst:
        result.append(func(i))
    return result

# Example usage:
def double(x):
    return x * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = map_list(numbers, double)
print(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
