## Exercise
Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their sum.

## Reference Solution
```python
def add_integers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two integers as input and returns their sum.
    
    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b

# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Calculate and print the sum
print("The sum of the two integers is:", add_integers(a, b))
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first integer: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpvr545_4p.py", line 15, in <module>
    a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2 3'
```
