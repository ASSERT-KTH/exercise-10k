## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the interest earned on an investment.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates the interest earned on an investment.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial investment amount.
        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).
        time (int): The time period of the investment in years.

    Returns:
        float: The interest earned on the investment.
    """
    interest = principal * rate * time
    return interest

def main():
    print("Investment Interest Calculator")
    print("--------------------------------")

    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = int(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    interest = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)
    total_amount = principal + interest

    print(f"\nInterest earned: ${interest:.2f}")
    print(f"Total amount: ${total_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
