## Exercise
Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given starting number and increment using if/else statements

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_sequence(start, increment, length):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on a given starting number and increment.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.
        increment (int): The increment value of the sequence.
        length (int): The length of the sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers representing the sequence.
    """
    sequence = []

    # Check if the increment is positive or negative
    if increment > 0:
        # Generate the sequence with a positive increment
        for i in range(length):
            sequence.append(start + (i * increment))
    elif increment < 0:
        # Generate the sequence with a negative increment
        for i in range(length):
            sequence.append(start - (i * abs(increment)))
    else:
        # If the increment is 0, the sequence will be a list of the same number
        sequence = [start] * length

    return sequence


def main():
    start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
    increment = int(input("Enter the increment value: "))
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: "))

    sequence = generate_sequence(start, increment, length)

    print("Generated Sequence:")
    print(sequence)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the starting number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpcbb4z8id.py", line 43, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpcbb4z8id.py", line 32, in main
    start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5, 2'
```
