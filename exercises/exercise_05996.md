## Exercise
Write a function that takes a list and a value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list if it exists

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_index(lst, value):
    """
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): The list to search in.
        value: The value to search for.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the value if it exists, -1 otherwise.
    """
    try:
        return lst.index(value)
    except ValueError:
        return -1

# Example usage:
def main():
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    value = 3
    index = find_index(lst, value)
    if index != -1:
        print(f"The first occurrence of {value} is at index {index}.")
    else:
        print(f"{value} does not exist in the list.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The first occurrence of 3 is at index 2.
```
