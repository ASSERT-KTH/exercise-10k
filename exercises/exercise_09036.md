## Exercise
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its cube root

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def cube_root(number):
    """
    Calculates the cube root of a given number.

    Args:
        number (float): The number to calculate the cube root for.

    Returns:
        float: The cube root of the given number.
    """
    return round(number ** (1/3), 3)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number = 27
    result = cube_root(number)
    print(f"The cube root of {number} is {result}")
```

```python
import math

def cube_root(number):
    return round(math.pow(number, 1/3), 3)
```

## Generated Output
```
The cube root of 27 is 3.0
```
