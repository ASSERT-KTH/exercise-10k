## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the average of three marks given by the user. The program should first prompt the user to enter the three marks, then calculate the average, and finally display the result.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Today's Date]
# Purpose: To calculate the average of three marks

# Get the three marks from the user
mark1 = float(input("Enter mark 1: "))
mark2 = float(input("Enter mark 2: "))
mark3 = float(input("Enter mark 3: "))

# Calculate the average of the three marks
average = (mark1 + mark2 + mark3) / 3

# Print the result
print("The average of the three marks is: ", average)

# Quit the program
quit()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter mark 1: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpj0p5ltaj.py", line 6, in <module>
    mark1 = float(input("Enter mark 1: "))
