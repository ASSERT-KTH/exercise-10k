## Exercise
Given a string, find the minimal rotation of the string that is lexicographically smallest.

## Reference Solution
```python
def minimal_rotation(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the minimal rotation of a string that is lexicographically smallest.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: The minimal rotation of the string.
    """
    # Generate all rotations of the string
    rotations = [s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s))]

    # Find the lexicographically smallest rotation
    return min(rotations)

# Example usage
s = "bca"
print(minimal_rotation(s))  # Output: "abc"
```

## Generated Output
```
abc
```
