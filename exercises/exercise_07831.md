## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop or a while loop. The program should take an integer n as input and output the sum of squares.

## Reference Solution
```python
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, sum = 0;

    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i * i;
    }

    printf("%d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```
