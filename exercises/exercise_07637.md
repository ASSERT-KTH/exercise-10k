## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10
fib_numbers = generate_fibonacci(n)
print(f"The first {n} Fibonacci numbers are: {fib_numbers}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
