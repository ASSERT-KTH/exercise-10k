## Exercise
Write a program to divide two numbers and print the quotient and remainder.

## Reference Solution
```python
def divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder

# Get the numbers from the user
dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

# Check for division by zero
if divisor == 0:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)
    print(f"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the dividend: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp2o9aw_0o.py", line 7, in <module>
    dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '17 5'
```
