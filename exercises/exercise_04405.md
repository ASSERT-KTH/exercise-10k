## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.
    """
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

## Generated Output
```
The average of the numbers is: 3.0
