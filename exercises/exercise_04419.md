## Exercise
Write a program that solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using a recursive function with a for loop.

## Reference Solution
```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    """
    Move n disks from the source rod to the target rod using the auxiliary rod.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of disks.
    source (str): The source rod.
    target (str): The target rod.
    auxiliary (str): The auxiliary rod.
    """
    if n == 1:
        # Base case: If there's only one disk, move it directly from source to target.
        print(f"Move disk 1 from rod {source} to rod {target}")
        return
    
    # Recursive case: Move n - 1 disks from source to auxiliary, 
    # then move the nth disk from source to target, and finally 
    # move the n - 1 disks from auxiliary to target.
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from rod {source} to rod {target}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)


def main():
    n = 3
    source = 'A'
    target = 'C'
    auxiliary = 'B'
    print(f"Solving Tower of Hanoi for {n} disks...")
    tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Solving Tower of Hanoi for 3 disks...
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
```
