## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the user's year of birth based on their age and the current year.

## Reference Solution
```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_year_of_birth():
    # Get the current year
    current_year = date.today().year

    # Ask the user for their age
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    # Calculate the year of birth
    year_of_birth = current_year - age

    print(f"Based on your age, your year of birth is: {year_of_birth}")

# Call the function
calculate_year_of_birth()
```

## Generated Output
