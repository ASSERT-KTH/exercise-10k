## Exercise
Create a function that uses the filter() function to filter a list of numbers based on a given condition

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
    """
    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
        condition (function): A function that takes a number as input and returns a boolean value.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the given condition.
    """
    return list(filter(condition, numbers))

# Example usage:
# Define a condition function that checks if a number is even
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter the list of numbers based on the condition
filtered_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)

print(filtered_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
