## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The program should then call these functions with the length and width of the rectangle as arguments and print the results.

## Reference Solution
```python
def area(l, b):
    area = l * b
    return area

def perimeter(l, b):
    perimeter = 2 * (l + b)
    return perimeter

l = 5
b = 4
print("Perimeter:", perimeter(l, b))
print("Area:", area(l, b))
```

## Generated Output
```
Perimeter: 18
Area: 20
```
