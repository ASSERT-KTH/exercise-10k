## Exercise
Create a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a guess until they guess a predetermined secret number.

## Reference Solution
```python
def number_guessing_game():
    # Define the secret number
    secret_number = 42
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    # Loop until the user guesses the secret number
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number: ")
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of attempts
        attempts += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number: Too high! Try again.
Guess a number:
