    return name, age, address

def print_user_info(name, age, address):
    """Prints user information in a formatted manner."""
    print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Address: {address}")

def main():
    """Main function."""
    name, age, address = get_user_info()
    print_user_info(name, age, address)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
