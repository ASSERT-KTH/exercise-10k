## Exercise
Write a program that uses a while loop to calculate and print the first n Fibonacci numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def print_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Print the first n Fibonacci numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1

    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the current Fibonacci number
    i = 0

    # Use a while loop to calculate and print the first n Fibonacci numbers
    while i < n:
        # Print the current Fibonacci number
        print(a)

        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number
        a, b = b, a + b

        # Increment the counter
        i += 1


# Example usage:
n = 10
print(f"First {n} Fibonacci numbers:")
print_fibonacci(n)
```

## Generated Output
```
First 10 Fibonacci numbers:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```
