## Exercise
Write a function that uses mutual recursion to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using mutual recursion.

    Args:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    return gcd_helper(a, b)

def gcd_helper(a, b):
    """
    Helper function for calculating the greatest common divisor using mutual recursion.

    Args:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd_helper(b, a % b)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 48
    num2 = 18
    result = gcd(num1, num2)
    print(f"The greatest common divisor of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The greatest common divisor of 48 and 18 is: 6
```
