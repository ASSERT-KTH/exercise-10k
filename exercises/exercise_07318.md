## Exercise
Write a program that takes input from the user and writes it to a file.

## Reference Solution
```python
def write_to_file(file_name):
    """
    Writes user input to a specified file.

    Args:
        file_name (str): The name of the file to write to.
    """
    # Get user input
    user_input = input("Please enter some text: ")

    try:
        # Open the file in write mode
        with open(file_name, "w") as file:
            # Write the user input to the file
            file.write(user_input)
        print(f"Text successfully written to {file_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


def main():
    # Specify the file name
    file_name = input("Please enter the file name: ")

    # Check if the file name has a .txt extension, if not, add it
    if not file_name.endswith(".txt"):
        file_name += ".txt"

    # Call the function to write to the file
    write_to_file(file_name)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter the file name: Please enter some text: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpizij727i.py", line 34, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpizij727i.py", line 30, in main
    write_to_file(file_name)
  File "/tmp/tmpizij727i.py", line 9, in write_to_file
    user_input = input("Please enter some text: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
