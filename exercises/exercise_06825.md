## Exercise
Write a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should have a specified number of rows, and each row should have a number of asterisks equal to the row number. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program should print a pattern with 5 rows, where the first row has 1 asterisk, the second row has 2 asterisks, and so on.

## Reference Solution
```python
// input: 5

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, j;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("%d", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
