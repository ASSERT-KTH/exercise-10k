## Exercise
Write a program that takes the distance traveled and fuel consumed of a vehicle as input and outputs its fuel efficiency.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel):
    """
    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.

    Args:
        distance (float): Distance traveled in kilometers.
        fuel (float): Fuel consumed in liters.

    Returns:
        float: Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter.
    """
    if fuel == 0:
        return 0
    return distance / fuel


def main():
    # Get user input
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: "))
    fuel = float(input("Enter the fuel consumed in liters: "))

    # Calculate fuel efficiency
    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The fuel efficiency of the vehicle is {fuel_efficiency:.2f} km/l.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpj9tvivfn.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpj9tvivfn.py", line 19, in main
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '250 10'
```
