## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the interest earned on an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate the interest earned on an investment.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.
        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.
        time (int): The time period in years.

    Returns:
        float: The interest earned on the investment.
    """
    interest = principal * rate * time
    return interest

def calculate_total_amount(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate the total amount after a given time period.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.
        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.
        time (int): The time period in years.

    Returns:
        float: The total amount after the given time period.
    """
    total_amount = principal + calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)
    return total_amount

def main():
    # Get user input
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = int(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate and display the interest earned and total amount
    interest_earned = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)
    total_amount = calculate_total_amount(principal, rate, time)

    print(f"Interest earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}")
    print(f"Total amount after {time} years: ${total_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmplaasbiam.py", line 45, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmplaasbiam.py", line 33, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
