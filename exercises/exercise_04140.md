## Exercise
Initialize variables before using them to avoid errors

## Reference Solution
```python
# Initialize variable at declaration
my_variable = 0

# Use default values
is_admin = False

# Define named constants
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5

# Use initialized variables
if my_variable > 0:
    print("My variable is greater than 0")

if is_admin:
    print("User is an admin")

if MAX_ATTEMPTS > 3:
    print("Max attempts is greater than 3")
```

## Generated Output
```
Max attempts is greater than 3
```
