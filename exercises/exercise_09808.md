## Exercise
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices. The program should handle arrays of varying lengths and element values.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_even_odd_indices(array):
    even = 0
    odd = 0

    for index, element in enumerate(array):
        if index % 2 == 0:
            even += element
        else:
            odd += element

    return even, odd

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_sum, odd_sum = sum_even_odd_indices(array)
print(f"Sum of even indices: {even_sum}")
print(f"Sum of odd indices: {odd_sum}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Sum of even indices: 9
Sum of odd indices: 12
```
