## Exercise
Write a program to use conditional statements to make decisions based on user input.

## Reference Solution
```python
def main():
    # Get user input
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    # Check if the user is eligible to vote
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")

    # Check if the user is eligible to drink
    if age >= 21:
        print("You are eligible to drink.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to drink.")

    # Check if the user is eligible for senior discounts
    if age >= 65:
        print("You are eligible for senior discounts.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible for senior discounts.")

    # Check if the user is a minor
    if age < 18:
        print("You are a minor.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your age: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp2maidbxv.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp2maidbxv.py", line 3, in main
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'yes'
```
