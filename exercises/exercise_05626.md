## Exercise
Create a program to find an element in a sorted list using the binary search algorithm.

## Reference Solution
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Searches for an element in a sorted list using the binary search algorithm.

    Args:
    arr (list): The sorted list to search.
    target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.
    """
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
target = 23

result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} is present at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Element {target} is not present in the list.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Element 23 is present at index 5.
```
