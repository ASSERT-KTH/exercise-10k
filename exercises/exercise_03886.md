## Exercise
Create a game where two players can play rock, paper, scissors, and the program determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Get the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_player_choice():
    """Get the player's choice"""
    while True:
        player_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        if player_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            return player_choice
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner based on the game's rules"""
    if player_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (player_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (player_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (player_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "Player wins!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    """Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game"""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    while True:
        player_choice = get_player_choice()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nPlayer chose: {player_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != 'yes':
            break

        while player1_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            player1_choice = input("Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()

        while player2_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            player2_choice = input("Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        
        print(f"\nPlayer 1 chose: {player1_choice}")
        print(f"Player 2 chose: {player2_choice}\n")
        
        if player1_choice == player2_choice:
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif (player1_choice == 'rock' and player2_choice == 'scissors') or \
             (player1_choice == 'scissors' and player2_choice == 'paper') or \
             (player1_choice == 'paper' and player2_choice == 'rock'):
            print("Player 1 wins!")
        else:
            print("Player 2 wins!")
        
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != 'yes':
            break

def main():
    print("1. Play against the computer")
    print("2. Play with two players")
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2): ")
    if choice == '1':
        play_game()
    elif choice == '2':
        two_player_game()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
1. Play against the computer
2. Play with two players
Enter your choice (1/2): Invalid choice. Please try again.
