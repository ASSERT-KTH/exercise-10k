## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for the cost of a meal and the tip percentage, and then calculates and prints out the total cost of the meal, including the tip.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the tip amount
def calculate_tip(cost, tip_percentage):
    tip_amount = cost * (tip_percentage / 100)
    return tip_amount

# Define a function to calculate the total cost of a meal
def calculate_total_cost(cost, tip_percentage):
    tip_amount = calculate_tip(cost, tip_percentage)
    total_cost = cost + tip_amount
    return total_cost

# Main function
def main():
    # Print a welcome message
    print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

    # Ask the user for the cost of the meal
    cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))

    # Ask the user for the tip percentage
    tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage (e.g. 15 for 15%): "))

    # Calculate the total cost of the meal
    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(cost, tip_percentage)

    # Print the total cost of the meal
    print("The total cost of the meal is: $%.2f" % total_cost)

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
Enter the cost of the meal: $
Traceback (most recent call last):

    main()

    cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: $"))
