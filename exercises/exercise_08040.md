## Exercise
Write a program that uses an if/else statement to determine the weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):
    """
    Determine the weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity.

    Args:
        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
        humidity (float): The current humidity as a percentage.

    Returns:
        str: The weather forecast.
    """
    if temperature >= 25 and humidity >= 60:
        return "It's going to be a hot and humid day. Expect thunderstorms."
    elif temperature >= 20 and humidity < 60:
        return "It's going to be a warm and sunny day."
    elif temperature < 10 and humidity >= 80:
        return "It's going to be a cold and rainy day."
    elif temperature < 0 and humidity >= 80:
        return "It's going to be a cold and snowy day."
    else:
        return "It's going to be a mild day with no extreme weather conditions."


def main():
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
    humidity = float(input("Enter the current humidity as a percentage: "))

    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)
    print(forecast)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpydt7f0ga.py", line 33, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpydt7f0ga.py", line 25, in main
    temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '25 60'
```
