## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it, using conditional statements to provide hints.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Import the random module to generate random numbers
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

# Initialize the number of tries the user has made
tries = 0

print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

# Continue to ask the user for input until they guess the number
while True:
    # Ask the user for their guess
    user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")

    # Check if the user wants to quit
    if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
        print("Okay, I was thinking of number", number_to_guess)
        break

    # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
    try:
        user_guess = int(user_guess)
    except ValueError:
        print("That's not a valid number!")
        continue

    # Increment the number of tries the user has made
    tries += 1

    # Check if the user's guess is correct
    if user_guess == number_to_guess:
        print("Congratulations! You found the number in", tries, "tries.")
        break
    # If the user's guess is too high, tell them
    elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
        print("Your guess is too high. Try again!")
    # If the user's guess is too low, tell them
    else:
        print("Your guess is too low. Try again!")
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: Your guess is too high. Try again!
Take a guess: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp84slx0xr.py", line 16, in <module>
    user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
