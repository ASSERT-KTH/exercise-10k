    """
    if age < 0:
        return "Invalid age"
    elif age <= 12:
        return "Child"
    elif age <= 19:
        return "Teenager"
    elif age <= 64:
        return "Adult"
    else:
        return "Senior Citizen"

def main():
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    age_group = determine_age_group(age)
    print(f"Your age group is: {age_group}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
