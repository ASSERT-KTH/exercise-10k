## Exercise
Create a function called 'calculate_stats' that takes a list of exam scores as input and returns a dictionary containing the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score. The function should also handle cases where the input list is empty.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_stats(scores):
    """
    This function calculates and returns the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score from a given list of exam scores.
    
    Args:
        scores (list): A list of exam scores.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score. If the input list is empty, it returns None for all values.
    """

    # First, we check if the input list is empty
    if not scores:
        # If the list is empty, we return a dictionary with None values for all stats
        return {
            'average': None,
            'highest': None,
            'lowest': None
        }

    # Next, we calculate the average score by summing up all scores and dividing by the number of scores
    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)

    # Then, we find the highest score by using the built-in max function
    highest_score = max(scores)

    # After that, we find the lowest score by using the built-in min function
    lowest_score = min(scores)

    # Finally, we return a dictionary containing the calculated stats
    return {
        'average': average_score,
        'highest': highest_score,
        'lowest': lowest_score
    }
```
