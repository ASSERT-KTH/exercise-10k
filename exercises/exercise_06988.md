    Args:
        hours (float): Time in hours.

    Returns:
        float: Time in minutes.
    """
    minutes = hours * 60
    return minutes

def main():
    # Get user input
    hours = float(input("Enter time in hours: "))

    # Convert hours to minutes
    minutes = hours_to_minutes(hours)

    # Print result
    print(f"{hours} hour(s) is equal to {minutes} minute(s)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
