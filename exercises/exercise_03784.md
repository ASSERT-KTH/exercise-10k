## Exercise
Write a function to suggest friends for a given user based on their mutual friends. The function should take a dictionary of friendships and a user as input, and return a list of suggested friends.

## Reference Solution
```python
def suggest_friends(friendships, user):
    suggested_friends = []
    
    for person, friends in friendships.items():
        if person in friendships[user]:
            for friend in friends:
                if friend not in friendships[user] and friend not in suggested_friends:
                    suggested_friends.append(friend)
    
    return suggested_friends

friendships = {
    "Alice": ["Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Bob": ["Alice", "Charlie", "Dave"],
    "Charlie": ["Alice", "Bob", "Dave"],
    "Dave": ["Bob", "Charlie"]
}

suggested_friends = suggest_friends(friendships, "Alice")
print(suggested_friends)
