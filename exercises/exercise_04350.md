## Exercise
Write a program that checks the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) and prints a corresponding greeting message

## Reference Solution
```python
from datetime import datetime

def get_time_of_day():
    """Returns the current time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)"""
    now = datetime.now()
    hour = now.hour
    if 0 <= hour < 12:
        return "morning"
    elif 12 <= hour < 17:
        return "afternoon"
    else:
        return "evening"

def print_greeting(time_of_day):
    """Prints a greeting message based on the time of day"""
    greetings = {
        "morning": "Good morning!",
        "afternoon": "Good afternoon!",
        "evening": "Good evening!"
    }
    print(greetings[time_of_day])

def main():
    time_of_day = get_time_of_day()
    print_greeting(time_of_day)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
