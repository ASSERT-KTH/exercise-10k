## Exercise
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it. Print 'Correct!' if the user guesses correctly, otherwise print 'Try again!'

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    # Ask the user to guess the number
    while True:
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
        
        # Validate the user's input
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
            continue
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print("Correct!")
            break
        else:
            print("Try again!")

# Call the function to start the game
guess_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 10: Try again!
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpmr9wfh4d.py", line 26, in <module>

    user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
