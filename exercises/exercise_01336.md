## Exercise
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with special characters encoded for use in a URL.

## Reference Solution
```python
import urllib.parse

def encode_string_for_url(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the string with special characters encoded for use in a URL.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string to be encoded.

    Returns:
        str: The encoded string.
    """

    # First, we need to import the necessary module. We'll use urllib.parse, which provides functions for manipulating URLs.

    # Now, we define our function encode_string_for_url that takes one argument, input_string.

    # We'll use the quote_plus function from urllib.parse, which replaces special characters with their corresponding escape sequences.
    # The quote_plus function is like quote, but also replaces spaces with plus signs, which is suitable for use in URL query strings.
    encoded_string = urllib.parse.quote_plus(input_string)

    # Finally, we return the encoded string.
    return encoded_string

# Example usage:
print(encode_string_for_url("Hello, World!"))
```

## Generated Output
```
Hello%2C+World%21
```
