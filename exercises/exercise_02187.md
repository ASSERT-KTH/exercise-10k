## Exercise
Write a function to count the number of words in a given string. The function should take a string as input and return the word count.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_words(input_string):
    """
    This function takes a string as input and returns the number of words in the string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string to count words from.

    Returns:
        int: The number of words in the input string.
    """

    # First, we need to split the input string into a list of words
    # We can use the split() method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item
    words = input_string.split()

    # Now, we can simply return the length of the list, which represents the number of words
    # The len() function returns the number of items in an object
    return len(words)

# Example usage:
print(count_words("Hello world, this is a test string"))  # Output: 7
```

## Generated Output
```
7
```
