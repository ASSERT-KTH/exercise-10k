## Exercise
Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor

## Reference Solution
```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)
```

```python
print(gcd(12, 15))  # Output: 3
print(gcd(24, 30))  # Output: 6
print(gcd(7, 11))   # Output: 1
```
