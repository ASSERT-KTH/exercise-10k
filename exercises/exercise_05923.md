## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user should be able to input their choice, and the program should generate a random choice and determine the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Returns the computer's random choice"""
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices"""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        return "You win!"
    return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}")
    print(f"You chose: {user_choice}\n")
    
    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
Computer chose: scissors
You chose: rock

You win!
