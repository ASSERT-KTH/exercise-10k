## Exercise
Create a higher-order function that filters a list of numbers based on a given condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def filter_numbers(condition, numbers):
    """
    Filters a list of numbers based on a given condition.

    Args:
        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns a boolean.
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.

    Returns:
        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the condition.
    """
    return [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]

# Example usage:
# Define a condition function
def is_even(num):
    """Checks if a number is even."""
    return num % 2 == 0

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter the list using the condition
even_numbers = filter_numbers(is_even, numbers)

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Define another condition function
def is_greater_than_5(num):
    """Checks if a number is greater than 5."""
    return num > 5

# Filter the list using the new condition
numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_numbers(is_greater_than_5, numbers)

print(numbers_greater_than_5)  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

```python
# Filter even numbers using a lambda function
even_numbers = filter_numbers(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Filter numbers greater than 5 using a lambda function
numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_numbers(lambda x: x > 5, numbers)
print(numbers_greater_than_5)  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Generated Output
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
