## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.

    Args:
        a (float): The length of the first side of the triangle.
        b (float): The length of the second side of the triangle.
        c (float): The length of the third side of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    return area

def main():
    # Get the lengths of the sides of the triangle from the user
    a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))
    c = float(input("Enter the length of the third side: "))

    # Check if the sides can form a triangle
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate the area of the triangle
        area = calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c)
        
        # Print the area of the triangle
        print(f"The area of the triangle is {area:.2f} square units.")
    else:
        print("The sides cannot form a triangle.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the length of the first side: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp3l_rfzdg.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp3l_rfzdg.py", line 25, in main
    a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '3 4 5'
```
