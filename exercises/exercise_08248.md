## Exercise
Develop a program that calculates a person's age based on their birth year using if/else statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birth_year):
    """
    Calculates a person's age based on their birth year.
    
    Args:
        birth_year (int): The person's birth year.
    
    Returns:
        int: The person's age.
    """
    current_year = date.today().year
    
    if birth_year > current_year:
        print("Birth year cannot be greater than the current year.")
        return None
    else:
        age = current_year - birth_year
        return age

def main():
    birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
    age = calculate_age(birth_year)
    
    if age is not None:
        print(f"Your age is: {age} years old")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your birth year: Your age is: 26 years old
```
