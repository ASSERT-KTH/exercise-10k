## Exercise
Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (float): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student (A, B, C, D, F).
    """
    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)
    if not 0 <= score <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.")

    # Determine the grade based on the score
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
    else:
        grade = "F"

    return grade


def main():
    # Get the score from the user
    try:
        score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score: The student's grade is: B
```
