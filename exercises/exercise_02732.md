## Exercise
Write a program to find the most frequent element in an array of integers

## Reference Solution
```python
def most_frequent_element(arr):
    """
    Find the most frequent element in an array of integers.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The most frequent element in the array.
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element
    freq = {}

    # Iterate over the array and count the frequency of each element
    for num in arr:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1

    # Find the element with the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    most_frequent = [num for num, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]

    # Return the most frequent element(s)
    return most_frequent

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
print(most_frequent_element(arr))  # Output: [4]
```

## Generated Output
```
[4]
```
