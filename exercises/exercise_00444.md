## Exercise
Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. Ask the user for their choice, generate a random choice for the computer, then determine the winner.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    """Generate a random choice for the computer."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner of the game."""
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    """Play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user."""
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        user_choice = input("Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()

    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")

    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(f"\n{result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): 
You chose: rock
Computer chose: rock

It's a tie!
```
