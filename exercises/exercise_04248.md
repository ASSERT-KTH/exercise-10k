## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height. The program should take the weight and height as input, and print the corresponding BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate the BMI
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    return bmi

# Define a function to determine the BMI category
def determine_bmi_category(bmi):
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9:
        return "normal"
    elif 25 <= bmi <= 29.9:
        return "overweight"
    else:
        return "obese"

# Main program
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
bmi_category = determine_bmi_category(bmi)

print(f"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f}. You are {bmi_category}.")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your weight in kg: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzjzn0x7u.py", line 18, in <module>
    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '70 1.75'
```
