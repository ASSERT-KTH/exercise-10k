def recommend_product(interests):
    """
    Recommends a product based on user interests.

    Args:
        interests (str): User's interests (e.g., "gaming", "reading", "music")

    Returns:
        str: Recommended product
    """
    if interests.lower() == "gaming":
        return "We recommend a high-performance gaming laptop."
    elif interests.lower() == "reading":
        return "We recommend an e-reader or a tablet with a reading app."
    elif interests.lower() == "music":
        return "We recommend a portable Bluetooth speaker or headphones."
    else:
        return "Sorry, we couldn't find a matching product. Please try again!"

def main():
    print("Welcome to our product recommendation program!")
    interests = input("What are your interests (e.g., gaming, reading, music)? ")
    print(recommend_product(interests))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
