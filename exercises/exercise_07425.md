## Exercise
Write a program that takes a dictionary as input where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and then find the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, the program should return all of them.

## Reference Solution
```python
def find_highest_average_grade(students):
    highest_average_grade = 0
    highest_average_grade_students = []

    for student, grades in students.items():
        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
        if average_grade > highest_average_grade:
            highest_average_grade = average_grade
            highest_average_grade_students = [student]
        elif average_grade == highest_average_grade:
            highest_average_grade_students.append(student)

    return highest_average_grade_students

# Example usage:
students = {
    'Alice': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 80},
    'Bob': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 95},
    'Charlie': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 90}
}

result = find_highest_average_grade(students)
print(result)
```

## Generated Output
```
['Bob']
```
