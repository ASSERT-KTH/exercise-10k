## Exercise
Write a program that evaluates a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point.

## Reference Solution
```python
def evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x):
    """
    Evaluate a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point.

    Parameters:
    coefficients (list): List of coefficients of the polynomial, from the constant term to the highest degree term.
    x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

    Returns:
    float: Value of the polynomial at the given point.
    """
    result = 0
    for degree, coefficient in enumerate(coefficients):
        result += coefficient * (x ** degree)
    return result

# Example usage:
coefficients = [3, 2, -1]  # represents the polynomial 3 + 2x - x^2
x = 2
result = evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x)
print(f"The value of the polynomial at x = {x} is {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
The value of the polynomial at x = 2 is 3
```
