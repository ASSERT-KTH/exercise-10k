## Exercise
Create a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and outputs the simple interest.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate simple interest
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculates simple interest based on principal amount, interest rate, and time.

    Args:
    principal (float): The initial amount of money
    rate (float): The interest rate (in percent)
    time (int): The time period (in years)

    Returns:
    float: The calculated simple interest
    """
    # Convert interest rate from percent to decimal
    rate = rate / 100
    
    # Calculate simple interest
    simple_interest = principal * rate * time
    
    return simple_interest

# Main function
def main():
    # Take input from user
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate (in percent): "))
    time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

    # Calculate simple interest
    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)

    # Display result
    print(f"The simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpzwp73eyq.py", line 37, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpzwp73eyq.py", line 25, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 5 2'
```
