## Exercise
Develop a program that calculates the compound interest amount based on the principal, rate, and time provided by the user.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=1):
    """
    Calculates the compound interest amount.

    Args:
        principal (float): The principal amount (initial investment)
        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal)
        time (int): The time the money is invested for in years
        compounds_per_year (int, optional): The number of times that interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        float: The amount after n years, including interest
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year)**(compounds_per_year*time)
    return amount

def main():
    print("Compound Interest Calculator")
    print("--------------------------------")

    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
    rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): ")) / 100
    time = int(input("Enter the time the money is invested for (in years): "))
    compounds_per_year = int(input("Enter the number of times that interest is compounded per year (default is 1): ") or 1)

    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year)

    print(f"\nAfter {time} years, your investment will be worth: ${amount:.2f}")
    print(f"The compound interest amount is: ${amount - principal:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Compound Interest Calculator
--------------------------------
Enter the principal amount: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmpf_s9fq4o.py", line 32, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmpf_s9fq4o.py", line 21, in main
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1000 0.05 2'
