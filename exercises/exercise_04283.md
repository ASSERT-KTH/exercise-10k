## Exercise
Write a function to update the value associated with a given key in a dictionary.

## Reference Solution
```python
def update_dict_key(dictionary, key, new_value):
    """
    Updates the value associated with a given key in a dictionary.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be updated.
        key (any): The key whose value is to be updated.
        new_value (any): The new value to be associated with the key.

    Returns:
        dict: The updated dictionary.
    """

    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary
    if key in dictionary:
        # If the key exists, we update its value
        dictionary[key] = new_value
    else:
        # If the key does not exist, we print a message to inform the user
        print(f"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.")

    # Finally, we return the updated dictionary
    return dictionary

# Example usage:
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(update_dict_key(my_dict, "age", 31))
```

## Generated Output
```
{'name': 'John', 'age': 31}
```
