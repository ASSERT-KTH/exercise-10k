## Exercise
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.

## Reference Solution
```python
def perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and prints the results.
    
    Args:
        num1 (float): The first number.
        num2 (float): The second number.
    """

    # Perform addition
    addition_result = num1 + num2
    print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}")

    # Perform subtraction
    subtraction_result = num1 - num2
    print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}")

    # Perform multiplication
    multiplication_result = num1 * num2
    print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}")

    # Perform division, checking for division by zero
    if num2 != 0:
        division_result = num1 / num2
        print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

def main():
    # Get input from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Perform arithmetic operations
    perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp3nmkdhqx.py", line 38, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmp3nmkdhqx.py", line 31, in main
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 5'
```
