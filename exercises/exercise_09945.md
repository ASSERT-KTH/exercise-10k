## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should define two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. Both functions should take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments.

## Reference Solution
```python
def area_rect(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def perimeter_rect(length, width):
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return perimeter

# Example usage:
length = 10
width = 20
print("Area:", area_rect(length, width))
print("Perimeter:", perimeter_rect(length, width))
```

## Generated Output
```
Area: 200
Perimeter: 60
```
