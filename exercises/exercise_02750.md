## Exercise
Write a program that calculates an object's acceleration given its initial and final velocities and time.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time):
    """
    Calculate an object's acceleration given its initial and final velocities and time.

    Args:
        initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
        final_velocity (float): The final velocity of the object in m/s.
        time (float): The time over which the object accelerated in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.
    """
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero.")
    acceleration = (final_velocity - initial_velocity) / time
    return acceleration


def main():
    # Example usage
    initial_velocity = 10  # m/s
    final_velocity = 20    # m/s
    time = 2               # seconds

    acceleration = calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time)
    print(f"The acceleration of the object is {acceleration} m/s^2.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The acceleration of the object is 5.0 m/s^2.
```
