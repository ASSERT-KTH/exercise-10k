## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for their age and validates that it is a positive integer, displaying an error message if the input is invalid.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_age():
    """Gets the user's age and validates that it's a positive integer."""
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
            if age <= 0:
                print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")
            else:
                return age
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: Age must be a positive integer.")

def main():
    """Main function."""
    age = get_age()
    print(f"Your age is: {age}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter your age: Your age is: 25
```
