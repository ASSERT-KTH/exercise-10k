## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers and create a new array containing only the even numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
    return even_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Original numbers:", numbers)
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

## Generated Output
```
Original numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
