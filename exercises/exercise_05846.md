## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a coin flip. The program should randomly choose either heads or tails and then print out the result

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def coin_flip():
    """
    Simulates a coin flip by randomly choosing between 'heads' and 'tails'.
    
    Returns:
        str: The result of the coin flip.
    """
    # Define the possible outcomes of a coin flip
    outcomes = ["heads", "tails"]
    
    # Randomly select an outcome
    result = random.choice(outcomes)
    
    return result

def main():
    # Simulate a coin flip
    result = coin_flip()
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"The coin landed on: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The coin landed on: tails
```
