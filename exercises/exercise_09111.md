## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), score < 60 (F).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Input a score
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Print the grade based on the score
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your score: B
```
