## Exercise
Write a program to generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask the user to guess it, providing hints if the guess is too high or too low

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def get_user_guess():
    """Get the user's guess and validate it."""
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
            if 1 <= guess <= 100:
                return guess
            else:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

def play_game():
    """Play the random number guessing game."""
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the random number guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        user_guess = get_user_guess()
        attempts += 1

        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Generated Output
```
