## Exercise
Create a program that performs a series of arithmetic operations on two input numbers. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. The program should first ask the user to input two numbers, then perform the operations, and finally print the results in a formatted manner.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Get input from user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2
modulus = num1 % num2
exponentiation = num1 ** num2

# Print results
print("Results:")
print(f"Addition: {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {division}")
print(f"Modulus: {modulus}")
print(f"Exponentiation: {exponentiation}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter first number: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp9hpe_vdg.py", line 2, in <module>
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10 3'
```
