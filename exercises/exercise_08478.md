## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_lcm(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the least common multiple of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The least common multiple of a and b.
    """
    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b
    gcd = math.gcd(a, b)

    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)
    lcm = abs(a * b) // gcd

    return lcm

def main():
    # Example usage
    num1 = 12
    num2 = 15

    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)
    print(f"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60
```
