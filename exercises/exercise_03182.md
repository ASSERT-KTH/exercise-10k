## Exercise
Write a program that takes a student's score as input and uses if/else statements to determine their grade (A-F).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    Calculate the grade based on the score.

    Args:
        score (int): The student's score.

    Returns:
        str: The student's grade.
    """
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'

def main():
    # Get the student's score
    while True:
        try:
            score = int(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))
            if score < 0 or score > 100:
                print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate and print the grade
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The student's grade is: {grade}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the student's score (0-100): The student's grade is: B
```
