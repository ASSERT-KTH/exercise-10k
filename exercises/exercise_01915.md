## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the standard deviation given a list of numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the mean of a list of numbers"""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_variance(numbers):
    """Calculate the variance of a list of numbers"""
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return variance

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers"""
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

def main():
    # Example usage
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)

    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Variance: {variance}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Mean: 3.0
Variance: 2.0
Standard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951
```
