## Exercise
Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the account type (checking or savings) and the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal). Based on the account type and transaction type, the program should then ask for the amount and apply the transaction. If the account type is checking and the transaction type is withdrawal, the program should check if the amount is greater than $1000. If it is, the program should charge a $5 fee. If the account type is savings and the transaction type is withdrawal, the program should check if the amount is greater than $500. If it is, the program should charge a $3 fee. The program should then display the new balance after the transaction.

## Reference Solution
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_type, balance=0):
        self.account_type = account_type
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
            if self.account_type == "checking" and amount > 1000:
                self.balance -= 5
                print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. A $5 fee was charged. New balance: ${self.balance}")
            elif self.account_type == "savings" and amount > 500:
                self.balance -= 3
                print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. A $3 fee was charged. New balance: ${self.balance}")
            else:
                print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to the bank transaction system!")
    account_type = input("What type of account do you have? (checking/savings): ")
    while account_type not in ["checking", "savings"]:
        account_type = input("Invalid account type. Please enter checking or savings: ")
    
    transaction_type = input("What type of transaction would you like to make? (deposit/withdrawal): ")
    while transaction_type not in ["deposit", "withdrawal"]:
        transaction_type = input("Invalid transaction type. Please enter deposit or withdrawal: ")
    
    account = BankAccount(account_type)
    
    if transaction_type == "deposit":
        amount = float(input("How much would you like to deposit? $"))
        account.deposit(amount)
    elif transaction_type == "withdrawal":
        initial_balance = float(input("What is your current balance? $"))
        account = BankAccount(account_type, initial_balance)
        amount = float(input("How much would you like to withdraw? $"))
        account.withdraw(amount)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Welcome to the bank transaction system!
What type of account do you have? (checking/savings): What type of transaction would you like to make? (deposit/withdrawal): What is your current balance? $How much would you like to withdraw? $
