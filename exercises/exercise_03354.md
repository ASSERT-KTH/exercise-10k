## Exercise
Write a program that uses a for loop to play a quiz game with a list of questions and answers.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define the list of questions and answers
questions_and_answers = [
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "answer": "Jupiter"},
    {"question": "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?", "answer": "William Shakespeare"},
    {"question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?", "answer": "Au"},
    {"question": "Who painted the Mona Lisa?", "answer": "Leonardo da Vinci"}
]

def play_quiz(questions_and_answers):
    # Initialize score
    score = 0

    # Loop through each question and answer
    for question in questions_and_answers:
        # Ask the question
        user_answer = input(question["question"] + " ")

        # Check if the user's answer is correct
        if user_answer.lower() == question["answer"].lower():
            print("Correct!\n")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer is {question['answer']}.\n")

    # Print the final score
    print(f"Quiz over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions_and_answers)}.")

# Call the function to play the quiz
play_quiz(questions_and_answers)
```

## Generated Output
```
What is the capital of France? Incorrect. The correct answer is Paris.

What is the largest planet in our solar system?
