## Exercise
Count the frequency of each character in a given string.

## Reference Solution
```python
def count_character_frequency(input_string):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
    """
    frequency_dict = {}
    for char in input_string:
        if char in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[char] = 1
    return frequency_dict

def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)
    print("Character Frequency:")
    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():
        print(f"{char}: {frequency}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a string: Character Frequency:
h: 1
e: 1
l: 2
o: 1
```
