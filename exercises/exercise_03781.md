## Exercise
Create a function that performs a binary search on a sorted list to find the index of a target value. If the target is not found, return -1.

## Reference Solution
```python
def binary_search(sorted_list, target):
    """
    This function performs a binary search on a sorted list to find the index of a target value.
    
    Args:
        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.
        target: The target value to be searched in the list.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the target value if found, -1 otherwise.
    """

    # Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the list
    low = 0
    
    # We subtract 1 from the length of the list because list indices in Python are 0-based
    high = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    # Continue the search until the two pointers meet
    while low <= high:
        
        # Calculate the middle index of the current range
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # If the target is found at the middle index, return the index
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # If the target is less than the middle element, update the high pointer
        elif sorted_list[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        
        # If the target is greater than the middle element, update the low pointer
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    # If the target is not found after the search, return -1
    return -1

# Example usage:
sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 5
print(binary_search(sorted_list, target))  # Output: 2
```

## Generated Output
```
2
