## Exercise
Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in three subjects. The program should use functions to calculate the average score and determine the grade. The grade should be determined as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

## Reference Solution
```python
# Function to calculate the average score
def calculate_average(score1, score2, score3):
    """
    Calculate the average of three scores.

    Args:
        score1 (float): Score of the first subject.
        score2 (float): Score of the second subject.
        score3 (float): Score of the third subject.

    Returns:
        float: The average score.
    """
    return (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3


# Function to determine the grade
def determine_grade(average_score):
    """
    Determine the grade based on the average score.

    Args:
        average_score (float): The average score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """
    if 90 <= average_score <= 100:
        return 'A'
    elif 80 <= average_score < 90:
        return 'B'
    elif 70 <= average_score < 80:
        return 'C'
    elif 60 <= average_score < 70:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'


# Main function
def main():
    # Input scores of the three subjects
    score1 = float(input("Enter the score of the first subject: "))
    score2 = float(input("Enter the score of the second subject: "))
    score3 = float(input("Enter the score of the third subject: "))

    # Calculate the average score
    average_score = calculate_average(score1, score2, score3)

    # Determine the grade
    grade = determine_grade(average_score)

    # Print the result
    print(f"Average Score: {average_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Grade: {grade}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter the score of the first subject: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmph3uftbvf.py", line 59, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmph3uftbvf.py", line 43, in main
    score1 = float(input("Enter the score of the first subject: "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '80 70 90'
```
