## Exercise
Create a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list that are divisible by 3 or 5. The function should take a list of integers as input and return the sum of the numbers that meet the condition.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_divisible_by_three_or_five(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all numbers in a list that are divisible by 3 or 5.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5.
    """

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0, this will store the sum of the numbers that meet the condition
    total_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is divisible by 3 or 5
        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
            # If the number is divisible, add it to the total sum
            total_sum += num

    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list
    return total_sum
```
