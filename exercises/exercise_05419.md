## Exercise
Create a function named 'is_perfect_square' that checks if a given number is a perfect square.

## Reference Solution
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """
    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)
    return sqrt == int(sqrt)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers_to_check = [4, 9, 16, 20, 25]
    for num in numbers_to_check:
        result = is_perfect_square(num)
        print(f"Is {num} a perfect square? {result}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Is 4 a perfect square? True
Is 9 a perfect square? True
Is 16 a perfect square? True
Is 20 a perfect square? False
Is 25 a perfect square? True
```
