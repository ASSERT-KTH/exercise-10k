## Exercise
Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score as an integer and returns their corresponding grade as a string. The grade is determined by the following ranges: 90-100 (A), 80-89 (B), 70-79 (C), 60-69 (D), and below 60 (F).

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """
    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.

    Args:
        score (int): The score of the student.

    Returns:
        str: The grade of the student.
    """

    # First, we check if the score is within the valid range (0-100)
    if not 0 <= score <= 100:
        return "Invalid score"

    # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    
    # If the score is not A, we check if it's B (80-89)
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    
    # If the score is not A or B, we check if it's C (70-79)
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    
    # If the score is not A, B, or C, we check if it's D (60-69)
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    
    # If the score is none of the above, it must be F (below 60)
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function
print(calculate_grade(95))  # Output: A
print(calculate_grade(85))  # Output: B
print(calculate_grade(75))  # Output: C
print(calculate_grade(65))  # Output: D
print(calculate_grade(55))  # Output: F
```

## Generated Output
