## Exercise
Write a program that takes the income as input and calculates the tax using conditional statements.

## Reference Solution
```python
# Define a function to calculate tax
def calculate_tax(income):
    if income <= 0:
        return 0
    elif income <= 10000:
        return income * 0.05  # 5% tax for income up to $10,000
    elif income <= 20000:
        return (10000 * 0.05) + ((income - 10000) * 0.10)  # 10% tax for income between $10,001 and $20,000
    elif income <= 50000:
        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 20000) * 0.15)  # 15% tax for income between $20,001 and $50,000
    elif income <= 75000:
        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + ((income - 50000) * 0.20)  # 20% tax for income between $50,001 and $75,000
    else:
        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + (25000 * 0.20) + ((income - 75000) * 0.25)  # 25% tax for income above $75,000

# Take income as input
income = float(input("Enter your income: "))

# Calculate tax
tax = calculate_tax(income)

# Print tax
print(f"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}")
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: Your tax is: $6000.00
```
