## Exercise
Generate the first n rows of Pascal's triangle. The function should take in an integer n as input and return the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

## Reference Solution
```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in Pascal's triangle.
    """
    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]
    for i in range(2, n):
        for j in range(1, i):
            # Each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
    return triangle

# Example usage:
def print_pascals_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print Pascal's triangle in a formatted way.

    Args:
        triangle (list): A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - len(row)), end='')
        print(' '.join(str(num) for num in row))

# Generate and print the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle
n = 5
triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
print_pascals_triangle(triangle)
```

## Generated Output
```
1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```
