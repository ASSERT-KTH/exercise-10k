## Exercise
Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list, but with a twist: if the list contains a zero, the function should return the sum of all the numbers up to but not including the zero. If the list does not contain a zero, the function should return the sum of all the numbers in the list.

## Reference Solution
```python
def sum_up_to_zero(nums):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of all numbers in a list up to but not including the first zero it encounters.
    If the list does not contain a zero, it returns the sum of all numbers in the list.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all numbers in the list up to but not including the first zero, or the sum of all numbers if no zero is found.
    """

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in nums:
        # Check if the current number is zero
        if num == 0:
            # If it's zero, break out of the loop because we don't want to include this number or any after it in the sum
            break
        # If it's not zero, add it to the total sum
        total_sum += num
    
    # After iterating over all numbers (or breaking out of the loop when a zero is found), return the total sum
    return total_sum
```
