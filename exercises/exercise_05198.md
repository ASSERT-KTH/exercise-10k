## Exercise
Write a program that asks the user for a message and then responds with a pre-defined response based on the user's input.

## Reference Solution
```python
def get_user_message():
    """Get user message."""
    user_message = input("Please enter a message: ")
    return user_message

def generate_response(message):
    """Generate response based on user message."""
    responses = {
        "hello": "Hi, how are you?",
        "how are you": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
        "what's your name": "I'm an AI, I don't have a name.",
        "default": "Sorry, I didn't understand that."
    }
    
    # Convert user message to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    message = message.lower()
    
    # Check if user message matches any of the predefined responses
    for key in responses:
        if key in message:
            return responses[key]
    
    # Return default response if no match found
    return responses["default"]

def main():
    """Main function."""
    user_message = get_user_message()
    response = generate_response(user_message)
    print("Response: ", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Please enter a message: Response:  Hi, how are you?
```
