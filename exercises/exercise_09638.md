## Exercise
Create a function that uses type hints to specify the expected types of its arguments and return value.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """

    # First, we need to check if the input values are valid (i.e., they are numbers)
    # We don't need to explicitly check for this because Python will raise an error if we try to multiply non-numeric values

    # Now, we can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width
    # This is based on the formula for the area of a rectangle: area = length * width
    area = length * width

    # Finally, we return the calculated area
    return area

# Test the function
print(calculate_area(5, 10))  # Output: 50.0
```

## Generated Output
```
50
```
