## Exercise
Use assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of a variable

## Reference Solution
```python
x = 5  # assign 5 to x
print(x)  # prints 5
```

```python
x = 5  # assign 5 to x
x += 3  # add 3 to x
print(x)  # prints 8
```

```python
x = 5  # assign 5 to x
x -= 3  # subtract 3 from x
print(x)  # prints 2
```

```python
x = 5  # assign 5 to x
x *= 3  # multiply x by 3
print(x)  # prints 15
```

```python
x = 15  # assign 15 to x
x /= 3  # divide x by 3
print(x)  # prints 5.0
```

```python
def main():
    x = 5
    print("Initial value of x:", x)

    # Addition assignment operator
    x += 3
    print("Value of x after addition:", x)

    # Subtraction assignment operator
    x -= 2
    print("Value of x after subtraction:", x)

    # Multiplication assignment operator
    x *= 2
    print("Value of x after multiplication:", x)

    # Division assignment operator
    x /= 2
    print("Value of x after division:", x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
