## Exercise
Write a program that calculates the tax amount based on the income and tax rate.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the tax amount based on the income and tax rate.

    Args:
        income (float): The income amount.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 25% = 0.25).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated tax amount.
    """
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    return tax_amount

def main():
    # Get user input
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (in %): ")) / 100

    # Calculate tax amount
    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)

    # Display result
    print(f"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Net income: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter your income: $
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmph7qk2fll.py", line 28, in <module>
    main()
  File "/tmp/tmph7qk2fll.py", line 17, in main
    income = float(input("Enter your income: $"))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Income 50000, Tax rate 20%'
