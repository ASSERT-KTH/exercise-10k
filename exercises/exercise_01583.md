## Exercise
Write a program to take a list of numbers as input from the user and calculate the sum of those numbers.

## Reference Solution
```python
def calculate_sum():
    # Get the list of numbers from the user
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces): ")

    # Convert the input string into a list of numbers
    try:
        numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")
        return calculate_sum()

    # Calculate the sum of the numbers
    total = sum(numbers)

    # Print the sum
    print("The sum of the numbers is:", total)

# Call the function to start the program
calculate_sum()
```

## Generated Output
```
Enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces): The sum of the numbers is: 15.0
