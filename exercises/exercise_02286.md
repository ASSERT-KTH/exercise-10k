## Exercise
Develop a program that thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and then asks the user to guess it. After each guess, the program should tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.

## Reference Solution
```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    # Think of a number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of tries
    tries = 0
    
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    print("Try to guess it!")
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
        
        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_guess.lower() == "quit":
            print("Okay, the number was {}.".format(number_to_guess))
            break
        
        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer
        try:
            user_guess = int(user_guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Increment the number of tries
        tries += 1
        
        # Check if the user's guess is correct
        if user_guess == number_to_guess:
            print("Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.".format(tries))
            break
        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Too high! Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_the_number()
```

## Generated Output
```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!
Enter your guess: Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess:
