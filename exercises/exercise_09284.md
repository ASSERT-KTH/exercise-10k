## Exercise
Write a function that replaces the elements at the even indices of a given array with the elements at the corresponding odd indices, and vice versa, without using any additional data structures. The function should modify the original array in-place.

## Reference Solution
```python
def swap_even_odd_indices(arr):
    """
    This function swaps the elements at even indices with the elements at odd indices in a given array.
    
    The function modifies the original array in-place without using any additional data structures.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input array to be modified.
    
    Returns:
    None
    """

    # We start by iterating over the array, but only up to the second last element, 
    # because we will be swapping the current element with the next one.
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        
        # For each pair of adjacent elements, we swap them.
        # This is done by using a temporary variable to hold one of the elements.
        # We use tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values without using a temporary variable.
        # This works by first packing the values into a tuple in reverse order, and then immediately unpacking them back into the array.
        arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
