## Exercise
Create a program that uses a for loop to fill in the blanks of a story with given words.

## Reference Solution
```python
def fill_in_the_blanks(story, words):
    """
    Fill in the blanks of a story with given words.

    Args:
        story (str): The story with blanks.
        words (list): The list of words to fill in the blanks.

    Returns:
        str: The story with the blanks filled in.
    """
    # Split the story into parts separated by blanks
    parts = story.split("{}")

    # Initialize the filled story
    filled_story = ""

    # Iterate over the parts and words
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        # Add the current part to the filled story
        filled_story += part

        # If it's not the last part, add the corresponding word
        if i < len(words):
            filled_story += words[i]

    return filled_story

# Example usage
story = "I went to the {} and bought a {}."
words = ["store", "book"]

filled_story = fill_in_the_blanks(story, words)
print(filled_story)
```
