    "description": "Create a program that stores student grades in a dictionary. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and a grade, then add the grade to the student's list of grades. If the student is not in the dictionary, the program should add the student with the given grade. The program should continue prompting the user until the user decides to stop. Finally, the program should print out the dictionary of student grades.",
