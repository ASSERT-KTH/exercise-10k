    "description": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation. The program should then have a main function that takes a user's input for the operation they want to perform and the two numbers, and calls the corresponding function to perform the operation and print the result.",
