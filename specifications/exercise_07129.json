    "description": "Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks followed by a sequence of spaces. The number of asterisks in each row should increase by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces should decrease by 1, starting from the user-inputted number. Use loops (for/while) to generate the pattern.",
