    "description": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a loop. The pattern should start with 1 and each subsequent row should have one more number than the previous row. The numbers in each row should be separated by a space. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2 1, 3 2 1, 4 3 2 1, 5 4 3 2 1",
