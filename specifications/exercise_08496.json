    "description": "Write a program that inverts a given dictionary. The inversion process means swapping the keys with the values. If the original dictionary has non-unique values, the inverted dictionary should have lists of keys as values. For example, if the input dictionary is {a: 1, b: 2, c: 1}, the output should be {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}. Handle the case where the input dictionary is empty.",
