    "description": "Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and end with the input number. Each line of the pattern should contain one more number than the previous line, and the numbers on each line should increase by 1. For example, if the input is 6, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2 3, 4 5 6",
