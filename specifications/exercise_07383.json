    "description": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the program should print the new balance after the withdrawal. Use conditional statements (if/else) to achieve this.",
