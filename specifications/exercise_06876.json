    "description": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). If the input string is a palindrome, print 'Palindrome' otherwise print 'Not a Palindrome'. The program should also reverse the input string and print the reversed string.",
