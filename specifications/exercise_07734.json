    "description": "Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list, but with a twist: if the list contains a zero, the function should return the sum of all the numbers up to but not including the zero. If the list does not contain a zero, the function should return the sum of all the numbers in the list.",
