    "description": "Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, utilizing dynamic programming to optimize performance. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth.",
