    "description": "Create a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should have a specified number of rows, and each row should have a specified number of asterisks. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 3 asterisks per row, the program should print a pattern with 5 rows, each containing 3 asterisks. Use loops (for/while) to solve this problem.",
