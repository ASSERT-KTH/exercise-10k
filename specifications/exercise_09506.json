    "description": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. If the string is not a palindrome, the program should reverse the string and print the reversed string. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print a message indicating that the string is a palindrome.",
