    "description": "Create a program that calculates the discount for a customer based on their age. If the customer is 65 or older, they receive a 10% discount. If they are between 18 and 64 (inclusive), they receive a 5% discount. If they are under 18, they receive a 20% discount. The program should take the customer's age and the original price as input and output the price after the discount.",
