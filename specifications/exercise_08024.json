    "description": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA' is 'BCBA'. Write a function to solve this problem using dynamic programming.",
