    "description": "Write a program that reads a string input from the user and checks if it matches a specific format. The format is 'DD/MM/YYYY', where 'DD' represents the day of the month, 'MM' represents the month, and 'YYYY' represents the year. If the input matches the format, the program should print 'Valid date' and the input date. If the input does not match the format, the program should print 'Invalid date' and prompt the user to enter the date again.",
