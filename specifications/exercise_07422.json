    "description": "Create a function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The function should take one argument, an integer n, and return its factorial. For example, factorial(5) should return 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. You should handle cases where n is less than 0 and raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.",
