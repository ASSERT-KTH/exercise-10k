    "description": "Create a program that validates bank transactions based on the account balance and transaction amount. The program should take two parameters: the current account balance and the transaction amount. If the transaction amount is greater than the account balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the program should print 'Transaction successful' and update the account balance by subtracting the transaction amount.",
