    "description": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCDE' and 'ABFCD' is 'ABC'. Your task is to write a function to compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences.",
