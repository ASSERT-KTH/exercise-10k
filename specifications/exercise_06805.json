    "description": "Create a program that takes in a mathematical expression as a string, evaluates it, and then checks if the result matches the expected output. The expression will only contain integer values and the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). If the result does not match the expected output, the program should provide a step-by-step breakdown of how it evaluated the expression.",
