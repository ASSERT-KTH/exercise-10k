    "description": "Write a program that takes a string input and checks if it is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print the reversed string. Otherwise, it should print a message indicating that the string is not a palindrome. The program should handle strings with spaces and special characters by ignoring them and considering only alphanumeric characters. It should also be case-insensitive.",
