    "description": "Write a program that uses loops to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, where each row contains a sequence of numbers from 1 to the row number. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2 1 2, 3 1 2 3, 4 1 2 3 4, 5 1 2 3 4 5. Use a for loop to iterate over the rows and a while loop to print the numbers in each row.",
