    "description": "Create a program that processes a dictionary containing student information. The dictionary should have student names as keys and another dictionary as values. The inner dictionary should contain the keys 'grades' and 'attendance'. The program should calculate the average grade for each student, and then print out the student's name, average grade, and attendance. If a student has an average grade above 90, mark them as 'Excellent', between 80 and 90 as 'Good', between 70 and 80 as 'Fair', and below 70 as 'Needs Improvement'.",
