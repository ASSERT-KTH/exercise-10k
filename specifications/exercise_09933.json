    "description": "Create a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a nested loop structure. The pattern should have 5 rows, and each row should have a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 up to the row number. For example, the first row should have the number 1, the second row should have the numbers 1 and 2, and so on. The outer loop should control the row number, and the inner loop should print the sequence of numbers for each row.",
