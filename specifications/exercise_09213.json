    "description": "Create a program that generates a looping pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks and spaces. The number of asterisks in each row should increase by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces should decrease by 1, starting from the input number minus 1. The program should use a loop to generate the pattern.",
