    "description": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade. The grade is determined by the following rules: score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'. Use conditional statements to implement this logic.",
