    "description": "Create a function that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course. The function should take in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course. The grades can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F', and the credits can be any positive integer. The GPA is calculated by multiplying the grade point for each course by its credit, summing these products, and then dividing by the total number of credits.",
