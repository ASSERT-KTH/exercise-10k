    "description": "Create a program that simulates a traffic light system. The program should take an integer input representing the current state of the traffic light (1 for red, 2 for yellow, 3 for green). Based on the current state, the program should print out the next state of the traffic light. If the current state is red, the next state should be green. If the current state is yellow, the next state should be red. If the current state is green, the next state should be yellow.",
