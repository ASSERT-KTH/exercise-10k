    "description": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to n, and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n, but shifted by the row number. For example, if n is 3, the pattern should be: 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5. The input will be a single integer n.",
