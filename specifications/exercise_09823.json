    "description": "Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The user will provide the number of rows and columns for the pattern. Use loops to generate the pattern and ensure that the number of asterisks in each row corresponds to the column number. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 5 columns, the output should be a square of asterisks with 5 asterisks in each row.",
