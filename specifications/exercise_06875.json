    "description": "Create a program that utilizes functions to perform advanced mathematical operations. The program should have separate functions for calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, the volume and surface area of a sphere, and the sum of the squares of two numbers. Each function should take the necessary parameters and return the calculated result. The main part of the program should prompt the user to choose an operation and then call the corresponding function with user-provided inputs.",
