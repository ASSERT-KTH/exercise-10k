    "description": "Create a function that takes a list of integers and an integer representing the number of steps to move, and returns the resulting list after moving each element in the list the specified number of steps to the right. If an element is at the end of the list, it should wrap around to the beginning. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number of steps is 2, the resulting list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].",
