    "description": "Create a function that takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image. The mirror image of a matrix is obtained by reversing the order of columns. For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], the mirror image would be [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]. The function should work with matrices of any size.",
