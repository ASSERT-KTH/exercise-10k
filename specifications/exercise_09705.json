    "description": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade. The grade is determined by the following rules: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, print 'Invalid score'. Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.",
