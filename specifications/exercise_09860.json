    "description": "Create a function that takes an input string and encodes it using a combination of string manipulation techniques: reverse the string, replace all vowels with their corresponding ASCII values, and then concatenate the result with its mirror image (the string reversed again). The function should handle both lowercase and uppercase letters and should not modify non-alphabetic characters.",
