    "description": "Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) and dashes (-) based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, where each row contains a combination of asterisks and dashes. The number of rows should be determined by the user. In each row, the number of asterisks should decrease by one from the previous row, and the number of dashes should increase by one from the previous row. The first row should start with the number of asterisks specified by the user and zero dashes.",
