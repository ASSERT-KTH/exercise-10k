    "description": "Write a program that uses loops to generate a specific pattern. The pattern consists of a series of numbers that increase by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, and decrease by 1 for each iteration of the inner loop. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The pattern should be repeated for the number of rows specified by the input.",
