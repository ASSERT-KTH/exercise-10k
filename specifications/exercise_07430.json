    "description": "Write a program that uses a while loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and repeat, with each repetition increasing by 1. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. If the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.",
