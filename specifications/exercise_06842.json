    "description": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array where the elements are reversed. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output array should be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The program should handle arrays of varying lengths and should not modify the original array.",
