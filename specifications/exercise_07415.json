    "description": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should take in the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal) and the amount. If the transaction type is 'deposit', the program should add the amount to the account balance. If the transaction type is 'withdrawal', the program should subtract the amount from the account balance, but only if the account balance is sufficient. If the account balance is not sufficient, the program should print an error message. The initial account balance is $1000.",
