    "description": "Create a function that takes a 2D grid of size n x m as input, where each cell can have a value of 0 or 1. The function should find a path from the top left cell to the bottom right cell, if one exists, using only cells with a value of 1. The path can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals). If a path is found, return the path as a list of coordinates. If no path is found, return an empty list.",
