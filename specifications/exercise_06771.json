    "description": "Create a program that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. The program should ask for the user's name, then prompt them to roll the dice. After rolling, it should display the result, including the total of the two dice and a message based on the total (e.g., 'Good roll!' if the total is 7 or 11, 'Better luck next time!' if the total is 2, 3, or 12, and 'Okay roll!' for any other total). The program should use input/output operations to interact with the user.",
