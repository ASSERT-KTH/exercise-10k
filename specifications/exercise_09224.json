    "description": "Create a program that defines and uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the corresponding operation. The program should then use these functions to calculate and print the results of the operations given the sample inputs.",
