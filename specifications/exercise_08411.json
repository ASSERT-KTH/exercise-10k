    "description": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student has passed or failed. The passing grade is 60. If the student's grade is 90 or above, output 'A', between 80 and 89, output 'B', between 70 and 79, output 'C', between 60 and 69, output 'D', and below 60, output 'F'.
