    "description": "Create a program that defines two functions: one to calculate the area of a rectangle and another to calculate its perimeter. Both functions should take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments. The program should then ask the user for the length and width, call the functions with these values, and print out the calculated area and perimeter.",
