    "description": "Create a program that can compress and decompress strings using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The program should take a string as input, compress it using RLE, and then decompress it back to the original string. The compressed string should be in the format of 'charactercount' (e.g., 'a3' for 'aaa'). The program should handle strings with repeated characters and single characters.",
