    "description": "Write a function that takes a string input and returns the string reversed, with the additional complexity of also reversing the order of characters within each word, while maintaining the original word order. For example, the string 'hello world' should be transformed into 'olleh dlrow'. The input string will only contain spaces as delimiters and lowercase English letters.",
