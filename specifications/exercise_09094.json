    "description": "Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print 'Loop' instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print 'Py'. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'LoopPy'. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and conditional statements to check for multiples.",
