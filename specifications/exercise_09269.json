    "description": "Write a program that finds the longest common subsequence of two input strings. The longest common subsequence is the longest sequence of characters that appears in the same order in both strings, but it may not be contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'abcdef' and 'zbcdfg' is 'bcdf'.",
