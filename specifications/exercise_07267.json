    "description": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence common to both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, given the sequences 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA', the longest common subsequence is 'BCBA' and its length is 4. Your task is to write a function that takes two sequences as input and returns the length of their longest common subsequence.",
