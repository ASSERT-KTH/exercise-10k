    "description": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The system should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw or deposit. If the user wants to withdraw an amount that exceeds their balance, the program should print 'Insufficient balance'. If the user wants to deposit a negative amount, the program should print 'Invalid deposit amount'. Otherwise, the program should update the user's balance accordingly and print the new balance.",
