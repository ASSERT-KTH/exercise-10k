  "answer": "**Longest Palindromic Substring Function**\n======================================\n\nHere is a Python function that uses a helper function to expand around the center of potential palindromes to find the longest palindromic substring:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest palindromic substring in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest palindromic substring.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Expands around the center of a potential palindrome.\n\n        Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n        left (int): The left index of the center.\n        right (int): The right index of the center.\n\n        Returns:\n        str: The longest palindromic substring centered at the given indices.\n        \"\"\"\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return s[left + 1:right]\n\n    longest_palindrome = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd-length palindrome\n        odd_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n        if len(odd_palindrome) > len(longest_palindrome):\n            longest_palindrome = odd_palindrome\n\n        # Even-length palindrome\n        even_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n        if len(even_palindrome) > len(longest_palindrome):\n            longest_palindrome = even_palindrome\n\n    return longest_palindrome\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(longest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\"))  # Output: \"bab\"\n    print(longest_palindromic_substring(\"cbbd\"))   # Output: \"bb\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the input string and treating each character as the center of a potential palindrome. It then expands around this center to find the longest palindromic substring. It checks for both odd-length and even-length palindromes.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  Define a helper function `expand_around_center` to expand around the center of a potential palindrome.\n2.  Initialize an empty string `longest_palindrome` to store the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n3.  Iterate through the input string, treating each character as the center of a potential palindrome.\n4.  For each character, check for both odd-length and even-length palindromes using the `expand_around_center` function.\n5.  Update `longest_palindrome` if a longer palindromic substring is found.\n6.  Return the longest palindromic substring found.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, because in the worst case, we need to expand around each character.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1), excluding the space needed for the input and output strings, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the longest palindromic substring.",
