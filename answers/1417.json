  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given airport code is valid. If the code is in a dictionary of valid codes, print 'Valid', otherwise print 'Invalid'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks if a given airport code is valid:\n\n```python\n# Dictionary of valid airport codes\nvalid_codes = {\n    'JFK': 'John F. Kennedy International Airport',\n    'LHR': 'London Heathrow Airport',\n    'CDG': 'Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport',\n    'AMS': 'Amsterdam Airport Schiphol',\n    'FRA': 'Frankfurt Airport',\n    'MAD': 'Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport',\n    'BCN': 'Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport',\n    'ATH': 'Athens International Airport',\n    'IST': 'Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport',\n    'DUB': 'Dublin Airport'\n}\n\ndef check_airport_code(code):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given airport code is valid.\n\n    Args:\n        code (str): The airport code to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    code = code.upper()  # Convert the code to uppercase\n    if code in valid_codes:\n        print('Valid')\n    else:\n        print('Invalid')\n\n# Test the function\ncheck_airport_code('JFK')  # Should print: Valid\ncheck_airport_code('LAX')  # Should print: Invalid\n```\n\nIn this program, we have a dictionary `valid_codes` that maps airport codes to their corresponding airport names. We define a function `check_airport_code` that takes an airport code as input, converts it to uppercase (since airport codes are case-insensitive), and checks if it exists in the `valid_codes` dictionary. If the code is found, it prints 'Valid'; otherwise, it prints 'Invalid'.\n\nYou can add more airport codes to the `valid_codes` dictionary as needed. This program can be easily extended to handle additional functionality, such as retrieving the airport name for a given code or adding new codes to the dictionary.",
