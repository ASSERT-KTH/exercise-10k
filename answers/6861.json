  "prompt": "Create a program that determines the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The program should take two inputs, the choice of player 1 and player 2, and output the winner or a tie.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    \n    # Validate player inputs\n    if player1_choice.lower() not in choices or player2_choice.lower() not in choices:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid choice. Choices must be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\")\n        \n    # Determine the winner\n    if player1_choice.lower() == player2_choice.lower():\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player1_choice.lower() == \"rock\" and player2_choice.lower() == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player1_choice.lower() == \"scissors\" and player2_choice.lower() == \"paper\") or \\\n         (player1_choice.lower() == \"paper\" and player2_choice.lower() == \"rock\"):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    player1_choice = input(\"Enter player 1's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \")\n    player2_choice = input(\"Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \")\n    print(determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `determine_winner` that takes two string inputs representing the choices of player 1 and player 2. It first validates the inputs to ensure they are one of \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\". If the inputs are valid, it determines the winner based on the game's rules and returns the result as a string.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to input the choices for player 1 and player 2, calls `determine_winner` with these inputs, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If both players choose the same option, the function returns \"It's a tie!\".\n* If player 1 chooses \"rock\" and player 2 chooses \"scissors\", the function returns \"Player 1 wins!\".\n* If player 1 chooses \"scissors\" and player 2 chooses \"paper\", the function returns \"Player 1 wins!\".\n* If player 1 chooses \"paper\" and player 2 chooses \"rock\", the function returns \"Player 1 wins!\".\n* In all other cases, the function returns \"Player 2 wins!\".",
