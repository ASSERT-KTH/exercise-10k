  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n====================================\n\nThis program checks whether a given number is prime or not using a basic algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm**\n-------------\n\nThe algorithm works by checking if the given number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. If it is, then the number is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then the number is prime.\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a prime number (e.g., 7, 11, 13) to see the program return \"is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number (e.g., 4, 6, 8) to see the program return \"is not a prime number.\"\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1 (e.g., 0, 1) to see the program return \"is not a prime number.\"\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`, since these numbers are not prime.\n3. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root using a `for` loop.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`, since `n` is not prime.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `True`, since `n` is prime.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.",
