  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n    year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `is_leap_year` that checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it meets the following conditions:\n\n* The year is evenly divisible by 4.\n* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is evenly divisible by 100), it must also be evenly divisible by 400.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if the year is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter a year when prompted.\n2. The program will print whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter a year: 2020\n2020 is a leap year.\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility. The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of the number before it by the number after it. For example, `year % 4` returns the remainder of the division of `year` by 4. If the remainder is 0, the year is evenly divisible by 4.",
