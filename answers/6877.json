  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote or not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Version: 1.0\n\n# Define the voting age\nvoting_age = 18\n\n# Get the user's name and store it in a variable\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Get the user's age and store it in a variable\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print a personalized greeting message\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote\nif age >= voting_age:\n    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n# Add a blank line at the end of the output\nprint()\n```\nNote that I've assumed that the author's name and date are placeholders and will be filled in accordingly. Also, I've used the `int()` function to convert the user's age input to an integer, as the `input()` function returns a string by default.",
