  "prompt": "Declare and initialize variables of different data types to store a student's information, including name, age, and grade. The program should then print out the stored information.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to store a student's information:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Declare and initialize variables of different data types\n    name = \"John Doe\"  # string\n    age = 20  # integer\n    grade = 3.8  # float\n\n    # Print out the stored information\n    print(f\"Name: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Age: {age}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we declare variables for `name`, `age`, and `grade`, and initialize them with the corresponding values. Then, we use f-strings to print out the stored information.\n\nWhen you run the program, it will output:\n\n```\nName: John Doe\nAge: 20\nGrade: 3.8\n```\n\n**Data Types Explanation:**\n\n*   `name`: A string data type is used to store the student's name because it can contain a combination of letters, spaces, and punctuation marks.\n*   `age`: An integer data type is used to store the student's age because it is a whole number.\n*   `grade`: A float data type is used to store the student's grade because it can have decimal points.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nThis program can be used in a school management system to store and display student information. You can extend it to store additional information, such as the student's major, course schedule, or academic achievements.",
