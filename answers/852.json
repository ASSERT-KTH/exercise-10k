  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a function that partially applies another function by fixing some of its arguments to specific values. This approach will allow for more flexible and reusable code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef partial_application(func, *args, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a new function with some arguments already applied.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The original function.\n        *args: Positional arguments to be applied.\n        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to be applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function with the given arguments already applied.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use the partial function from the functools module, which does exactly what we need.\n    # It returns a new function with the given arguments already applied.\n    return partial(func, *args, **kwargs)\n\n\n# Example usage:\n\ndef add(a, b, c):\n    # A simple function that adds three numbers.\n    return a + b + c\n\n# Create a new function that adds 1 and 2 to its first argument.\nadd_1_and_2 = partial_application(add, 1, 2)\n\n# Use the new function.\nprint(add_1_and_2(3))  # Outputs: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `partial_application` function utilizes the `partial` function from the `functools` module to create a new function with some arguments already applied.\n* This new function is then returned by `partial_application`, allowing for the creation of specialized functions with fixed arguments.\n* In the example usage, `add_1_and_2` is created by applying `1` and `2` as the first two arguments to the `add` function, resulting in a new function that takes a single argument and adds `1` and `2` to it.\n* The `add_1_and_2` function is then used to compute the sum of `1`, `2`, and `3`, demonstrating the effectiveness of the `partial_application` function.",
