  "answer": "Here is a Python program that estimates the total cost of items based on their prices and quantities.\n\n```python\nclass Item:\n    \"\"\"Class representing an item with price and quantity.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize an item.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): Name of the item.\n            price (float): Price of the item.\n            quantity (int): Quantity of the item.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.price = price\n        self.quantity = quantity\n\n    def calculate_cost(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the total cost of the item.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Total cost of the item.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.price * self.quantity\n\n\nclass ShoppingCart:\n    \"\"\"Class representing a shopping cart with items.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize an empty shopping cart.\"\"\"\n        self.items = []\n\n    def add_item(self, item):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add an item to the shopping cart.\n\n        Args:\n            item (Item): Item to be added.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.items.append(item)\n\n    def estimate_total_cost(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Estimate the total cost of all items in the shopping cart.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Total cost of all items.\n        \"\"\"\n        return sum(item.calculate_cost() for item in self.items)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a shopping cart\n    cart = ShoppingCart()\n\n    # Create items\n    item1 = Item(\"Apple\", 1.00, 5)\n    item2 = Item(\"Banana\", 0.50, 10)\n    item3 = Item(\"Orange\", 1.50, 3)\n\n    # Add items to the shopping cart\n    cart.add_item(item1)\n    cart.add_item(item2)\n    cart.add_item(item3)\n\n    # Estimate the total cost\n    total_cost = cart.estimate_total_cost()\n\n    # Print the total cost\n    print(f\"Estimated total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. We have two classes, `Item` and `ShoppingCart`.\n2. The `Item` class represents an item with a `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. It has a method `calculate_cost` to calculate the total cost of the item.\n3. The `ShoppingCart` class represents a shopping cart that can hold multiple items. It has methods `add_item` to add an item to the cart and `estimate_total_cost` to estimate the total cost of all items in the cart.\n4. In the `main` function, we create a shopping cart, add some items to it, and estimate the total cost.\n5. The estimated total cost is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\nYou can use this program to estimate the total cost of items in a shopping cart. For example, you can create items with different prices and quantities, add them to the cart, and then estimate the total cost.\n\n### Output\nWhen you run the program, it will output the estimated total cost of all items in the shopping cart. For the example in the `main` function, the output will be:\n\n```\nEstimated total cost: $17.50\n```",
