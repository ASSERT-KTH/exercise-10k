  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character Finder**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the first non-repeating character in a given string. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character, then iterates through the string to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n\n**Code**\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_freq = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate through the string to find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_freq[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    s = \"aabbc\"\n    result = first_non_repeating_char(s)\n    if result:\n        print(f\"The first non-repeating character is: {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No non-repeating character found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The `first_non_repeating_char` function takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It creates a dictionary `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n3. It iterates through the string to populate the `char_freq` dictionary.\n4. It then iterates through the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n5. If a non-repeating character is found, it returns the character.\n6. If no non-repeating character is found, it returns None.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n* Input: \"aabbc\"\n  Output: \"c\"\n* Input: \"aabbcc\"\n  Output: None\n* Input: \"abcdef\"\n  Output: \"a\" (since all characters appear only once)",
