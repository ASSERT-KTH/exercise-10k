  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 square of asterisks:\n\n```python\n# Define the size of the square\nsize = 5\n\n# Use nested for loops to print the square\nfor i in range(size):\n    for j in range(size):\n        print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n    print()\n```\n\nLet me explain what this program does:\n\n1. We first define the size of the square we want to print, which is 5 in this case.\n2. The outer for loop (`for i in range(size):`) iterates over each row of the square.\n3. The inner for loop (`for j in range(size):`) iterates over each column of the square.\n4. Inside the inner loop, we print an asterisk (`*`) followed by no newline character (`end=\"\"`).\n5. After the inner loop finishes, we print a newline character (`print()`) to move to the next row.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print a 5x5 square of asterisks. You can adjust the value of the `size` variable to print squares of different sizes.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\n*****\n*****\n*****\n*****\n*****\n```",
