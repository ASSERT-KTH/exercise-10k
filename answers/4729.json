  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function should have a docstring that describes its purpose and usage.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a greeting message based on a provided name, along with a docstring that explains its purpose and usage. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a greeting message to the console.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n\n    Example:\n        >>> greet(\"John\")\n        Hello, John!\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we want to start the greeting message with 'Hello, '\n    greeting_message = \"Hello, \"\n\n    # Then, we append the name to the greeting message\n    # We use the str.format() method to insert the name into the string\n    greeting_message += \"{}!\".format(name)\n\n    # Finally, we print the greeting message to the console\n    print(greeting_message)\n\n# Test the function\ngreet(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `greet` takes a `name` parameter of type `str` and returns `None`, indicating it doesn't return any value but performs an action (printing a message).\n* Inside the `greet` function, a `greeting_message` is constructed by concatenating the string \"Hello, \" with the provided `name` and an exclamation mark. This is achieved using the `str.format()` method for string formatting.\n* The `print` function is then used to output the `greeting_message` to the console, effectively greeting the person by their name.\n* The docstring within the `greet` function provides documentation on how to use the function, including the type of argument it expects and an example usage.",
