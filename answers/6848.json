  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number. Then, use a while loop to do the same.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Using a for loop\nprint(\"Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:\")\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Using a while loop\nprint(\"\\nPrinting numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop:\")\ni = 1\nwhile i <= 10:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n1. The `for` loop uses the `range` function to generate numbers from 1 to 10. It then prints each number in the range.\n\n2. The `while` loop starts with a variable `i` set to 1. The loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to 10. If the condition is true, it prints the current value of `i` and increments `i` by 1. This process repeats until `i` is greater than 10.\n\nYou can run this program to see the output. Both loops will print numbers from 1 to 10.",
