  "prompt": "Create a function called calculateGradePoint that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns their corresponding grade point. The grade points are as follows: score 90-100 corresponds to 4.0, score 80-89 corresponds to 3.0, score 70-79 corresponds to 2.0, score 60-69 corresponds to 1.0, and score below 60 corresponds to 0.0.",
  "answer": "### Calculate Grade Point Function\n#### Description\nThe `calculateGradePoint` function takes in a student's score as an argument and returns their corresponding grade point.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculateGradePoint(score: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade point based on the student's score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The corresponding grade point.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the score is not between 0 and 100.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not 0 <= score <= 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Score must be between 0 and 100\")\n\n    if 90 <= score <= 100:\n        return 4.0\n    elif 80 <= score <= 89:\n        return 3.0\n    elif 70 <= score <= 79:\n        return 2.0\n    elif 60 <= score <= 69:\n        return 1.0\n    else:\n        return 0.0\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]\n    for score in scores:\n        grade_point = calculateGradePoint(score)\n        print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade Point: {grade_point}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `calculateGradePoint` function takes in a `score` as an argument and returns the corresponding `grade_point`.\n*   It first checks if the `score` is between 0 and 100. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   Then, it uses if-elif-else statements to determine the `grade_point` based on the `score`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculateGradePoint` with example scores.",
