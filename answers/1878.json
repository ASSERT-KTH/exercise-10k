  "answer": "Here is a Python program that filters a list based on multiple conditions and prints the filtered list:\n\n```python\n# Define a list of dictionaries\npeople = [\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Mary\", \"age\": 20, \"city\": \"Chicago\"},\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n]\n\n# Define the conditions\nage_condition = 25\ncity_condition = \"New York\"\n\n# Filter the list based on the conditions\nfiltered_people = [person for person in people if person[\"age\"] == age_condition and person[\"city\"] == city_condition]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(\"Filtered List:\")\nfor person in filtered_people:\n    print(person)\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a list of dictionaries representing people with their names, ages, and cities. Then, we define the conditions for filtering the list: `age_condition` and `city_condition`. We use a list comprehension to filter the list based on these conditions, and finally, we print the filtered list.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n```\nFiltered List:\n{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n```\nThis shows that the program successfully filtered the list to include only the people who are 25 years old and live in New York. \n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **List of dictionaries**: The program starts by defining a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person with their name, age, and city.\n2. **Conditions**: The program defines two conditions: `age_condition` and `city_condition`, which are used to filter the list.\n3. **List comprehension**: The program uses a list comprehension to filter the list based on the conditions. The list comprehension iterates over each person in the list and includes them in the filtered list if their age matches `age_condition` and their city matches `city_condition`.\n4. **Printing the filtered list**: Finally, the program prints the filtered list by iterating over each person in the filtered list and printing their dictionary.\n\n### Advice\n\n* When working with lists of dictionaries, use list comprehensions to filter the list based on conditions.\n* Use meaningful variable names to make the code readable and understandable.\n* Use comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n* Test the code with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.",
