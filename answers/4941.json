  "prompt": "Write a program to determine whether a given number is even or odd using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that determines whether a given number is even or odd using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is odd.\")\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **User Input**: The program asks the user to enter a number, which is stored in the `num` variable.\n2. **Modulus Operator**: The modulus operator `%` is used to find the remainder of the division of `num` by 2.\n3. **Conditional Statement**: If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.\n4. **Print Result**: The program prints whether the number is even or odd.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters 10, the program will print \"10 is even.\"\n* If the user enters 11, the program will print \"11 is odd.\"\n\nThis program uses a simple and efficient approach to determine whether a number is even or odd, making it a great example of how to use conditional statements in programming.",
