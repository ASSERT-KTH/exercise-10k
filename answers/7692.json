  "answer": "**Exponentiation Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the exponentiation of a number. It takes two parameters: the base and the exponent.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef exponentiation(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the exponentiation of a number.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    base = 2\n    exponent = 3\n    result = exponentiation(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses the built-in exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the result.\n*   It takes two parameters: `base` and `exponent`, which are both floats.\n*   The result is returned as a float.\n*   In the example usage, we calculate 2 to the power of 3 and print the result.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This function does not handle cases where the base or exponent is not a number. You may want to add error checking depending on your use case.\n*   The function uses the built-in exponentiation operator, which is efficient and accurate for most use cases. However, for very large or very small numbers, you may need to use a specialized library or implementation.",
