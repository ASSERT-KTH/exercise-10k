  "answer": "### Understanding Variable Scope in Python\n#### Overview\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and accessible. In Python, variables can be defined inside or outside a function, and their scope determines where they can be used.\n\n#### Code Example\n```python\n# Variable defined outside the function (global scope)\nglobal_variable = 10\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Variable defined inside the function (local scope)\n    local_variable = 20\n    \n    # Accessing the global variable inside the function\n    print(\"Global variable inside the function:\", global_variable)\n    \n    # Accessing the local variable inside the function\n    print(\"Local variable inside the function:\", local_variable)\n\n# Accessing the global variable outside the function\nprint(\"Global variable outside the function:\", global_variable)\n\n# Trying to access the local variable outside the function will result in an error\ntry:\n    print(\"Local variable outside the function:\", local_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Error: Local variable is not defined outside the function.\")\n\n# Calling the function\nmy_function()\n```\n\n#### Output\n```\nGlobal variable outside the function: 10\nError: Local variable is not defined outside the function.\nGlobal variable inside the function: 10\nLocal variable inside the function: 20\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   `global_variable` is defined outside the function and is accessible both inside and outside the function.\n*   `local_variable` is defined inside the function and is only accessible within the function. Trying to access it outside the function results in a `NameError`.\n*   The `global_variable` can be accessed inside the function, and its value is the same as when accessed outside the function.\n*   The `local_variable` is only accessible within the function and has a local scope.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n*   Variables defined outside a function have a global scope and can be accessed anywhere in the code.\n*   Variables defined inside a function have a local scope and can only be accessed within that function.\n*   If a variable with the same name is defined both globally and locally, the local variable takes precedence within the function.",
