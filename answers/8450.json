  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that takes in a bill amount and calculates the corresponding tip based on the service quality:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(bill_amount, service_quality):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip based on the bill amount and service quality.\n\n    Args:\n        bill_amount (float): The total bill amount.\n        service_quality (str): The quality of service, which can be 'good', 'average', or 'bad'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if service_quality == 'good':\n        tip_percentage = 0.2  # 20% tip for good service\n    elif service_quality == 'average':\n        tip_percentage = 0.15  # 15% tip for average service\n    elif service_quality == 'bad':\n        tip_percentage = 0.1  # 10% tip for bad service\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid service quality. Please choose from 'good', 'average', or 'bad'.\")\n\n    tip_amount = bill_amount * tip_percentage\n    return tip_amount\n\n\ndef main():\n    bill_amount = float(input(\"Enter the bill amount: $\"))\n    print(\"Choose the service quality:\")\n    print(\"1. Good\")\n    print(\"2. Average\")\n    print(\"3. Bad\")\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3): \"))\n\n    if choice == 1:\n        service_quality = 'good'\n    elif choice == 2:\n        service_quality = 'average'\n    elif choice == 3:\n        service_quality = 'bad'\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose from 1, 2, or 3.\")\n        return\n\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(bill_amount, service_quality)\n    print(f\"Tip amount: ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount: ${bill_amount + tip_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program first defines a function `calculate_tip` that takes in the bill amount and service quality as input and returns the calculated tip amount. The service quality is used to determine the tip percentage.\n\nIn the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter the bill amount and choose the service quality. Based on the user's input, it calculates the tip amount using the `calculate_tip` function and prints the result.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEnter the bill amount: $100\nChoose the service quality:\n1. Good\n2. Average\n3. Bad\nEnter your choice (1/2/3): 1\nTip amount: $20.00\nTotal amount: $120.00\n```",
