  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and print the result, including the remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `divide_numbers` that takes two parameters, `dividend` and `divisor`.\n*   Inside the function, we first check if the `divisor` is zero to avoid a division by zero error. If it is, we print an error message and return from the function.\n*   We calculate the quotient using the `//` operator, which performs integer division, and the remainder using the `%` operator.\n*   Finally, we print the result, including the quotient and remainder.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program with a `dividend` of 17 and a `divisor` of 5, it will output:\n\n```\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2.\n```",
