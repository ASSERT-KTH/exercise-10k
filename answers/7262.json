  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student passed or failed based on a passing grade of 60. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the specifications:\n\n```python\n# This program determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their grade.\n\ndef determine_passing_status(grade):\n    if grade >= 60:\n        print(\"You passed!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You failed!\")\n\ngrade = input(\"Enter your grade: \")\ngrade = int(grade)\n\ndetermine_passing_status(grade)\n```\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle cases where the user enters a non-numeric value. If you want to handle such cases, you can add error handling code to the `input` section. For example:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        grade = int(input(\"Enter your grade: \"))\n        break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\")\n```",
