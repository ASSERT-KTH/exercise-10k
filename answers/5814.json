  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a for loop to manage a bank account:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    for i in range(5):\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n        if i == 4:\n            print(\"Maximum number of transactions reached. Exiting program.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1.  The `BankAccount` class is defined with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n2.  The `main` function creates an instance of the `BankAccount` class and enters a for loop that runs up to 5 times.\n3.  Inside the loop, a menu is displayed to the user, and they are prompted to enter their choice of action.\n4.  Based on the user's choice, the corresponding action is performed (deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit).\n5.  If the user chooses to exit or reaches the maximum number of transactions (5), the program terminates.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   Deposit: Enter `1` and the amount you want to deposit (e.g., `100`).\n*   Withdraw: Enter `2` and the amount you want to withdraw (e.g., `50`).\n*   Check Balance: Enter `3` to view your current balance.\n*   Exit: Enter `4` to exit the program.\n\nYou can run this program and follow the menu prompts to manage a bank account.",
