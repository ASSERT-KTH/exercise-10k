  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the power tower of a given number (i.e., the result of raising the number to the power of itself repeatedly).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\npublic class PowerTower {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(tower(3, 4));\n    }\n\n    public static double tower(double a, int n) {\n        if (n == 1) {\n            return a;\n        } else if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return Math.pow(a, tower(a, n - 1));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code defines a `PowerTower` class with a `main` method that calls the `tower` method with arguments `3` and `4`, and prints the result to the console. The `tower` method uses recursion to calculate the power tower of a given base `a` and exponent `n`, returning `a` when `n` is `1`, `1` when `n` is `0`, and the result of raising `a` to the power of the result of the recursive call with `n - 1` when `n` is greater than `1`.",
