  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the result variable to 1\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the counter variable to 1\n    i = 1\n    \n    # Loop until the counter is greater than the input number\n    while i <= n:\n        # Multiply the result by the current counter\n        result *= i\n        \n        # Increment the counter\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Return the calculated factorial\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function `factorial(n)` is defined, and two variables are initialized: `result` to store the factorial and `i` as a counter.\n2. **While Loop**: A while loop is used to iterate from 1 to the input number `n`.\n3. **Calculation**: Inside the loop, the `result` is multiplied by the current counter `i`, effectively calculating the factorial step by step.\n4. **Increment**: After each multiplication, the counter `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next number.\n5. **Return Result**: Once the loop completes (i.e., `i` is greater than `n`), the function returns the calculated factorial.\n6. **User Input and Output**: The program asks for a number as input, calculates its factorial using the `factorial(n)` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Calculating the factorial of 5: `factorial(5)` returns `120` because 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n- Calculating the factorial of 0: `factorial(0)` returns `1` because 0! is defined as 1.\n\nThis program demonstrates a basic implementation of factorial calculation using a while loop, suitable for educational purposes or simple applications.",
