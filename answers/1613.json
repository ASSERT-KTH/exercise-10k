  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and outputs its volume.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n```\ndef cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is {volume:.2f} cubic units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis program defines a function `cube_volume` that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length, and a `main` function that prompts the user for input and prints the result. The volume is calculated by cubing the side length.\n\nNote that this program also includes some basic error handling: if the user enters a negative side length, it raises a `ValueError`. If the user enters something that can't be converted to a float, the `float()` function will raise a `ValueError` exception, which is not caught here but would cause the program to terminate. \n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Enter a positive number, like `5`, to calculate the volume of a cube with that side length.\n* Enter a negative number, like `-5`, to see the error message.\n* Enter something that can't be converted to a float, like `abc`, to see the error message.",
