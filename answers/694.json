  "answer": "**Sales Tax Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of an item including sales tax. It takes the item's price and sales tax rate as input and returns the total cost.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of an item including sales tax.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The price of the item.\n        tax_rate (float): The sales tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the item including sales tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    sales_tax = price * tax_rate\n    total_cost = price + sales_tax\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the item's price from the user\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the item's price: $\"))\n\n    # Get the sales tax rate from the user\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the sales tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 8 for 8%): \"))\n    tax_rate /= 100  # Convert the tax rate to a decimal\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Sales tax: ${price * tax_rate:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the item's price when prompted (e.g., `100`).\n3. Enter the sales tax rate when prompted (e.g., `8` for 8%).\n4. The program will display the sales tax and total cost.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_total_cost` function takes the item's price and sales tax rate as input and returns the total cost.\n* The `main` function gets the item's price and sales tax rate from the user, calculates the total cost using the `calculate_total_cost` function, and prints the result.\n* The tax rate is converted to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to round the sales tax and total cost to 2 decimal places.",
