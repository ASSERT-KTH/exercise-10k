It has methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` object and provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the account.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter the account number, account holder's name, and initial balance when prompted.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter the deposit amount to add to the account balance.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the withdrawal amount to subtract from the account balance.\n\t* Check Balance: Display the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to exit the program.",
