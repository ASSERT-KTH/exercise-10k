  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula to calculate the volume of a cube is:\n\nV = s^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and s is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of the side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number.\")\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the calculated volume.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for the side length, calls the `calculate_cube_volume` function, and prints the result.\n3. The program checks if the side length is a positive number and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the side length of the cube: 5\nThe volume of the cube is: 125.00 cubic units\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `cube_volume_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python cube_volume_calculator.py`). Follow the prompt to enter the side length of the cube, and the program will print the calculated volume.",
