  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strings (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strings:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strings, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strings:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    strings = [\"hello\", \"hello world\", \"hello python\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hello\"\n\n    strings = [\"apple\", \"application\", \"apply\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"app\"\n\n    strings = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"elephant\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If so, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. Iterate through each character in the shortest string.\n4. For each character, check if it matches the corresponding character in all other strings. If a mismatch is found, return the substring up to the mismatched character.\n5. If no mismatches are found, return the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* The `min` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings.\n* The nested loops have a time complexity of O(n \\* m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.\n* Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n \\* m).\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n* The space complexity is O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used to store the shortest string and the longest common prefix.",
