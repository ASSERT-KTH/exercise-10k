  "answer": "**Rectangle Area Calculation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n    \n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_rectangle_area` takes two arguments: `length` and `width`.\n2. It checks if both `length` and `width` are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The area is calculated by multiplying `length` and `width`.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n5. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated. The area of a rectangle with a length of 5.0 and a width of 3.0 is calculated and printed.",
