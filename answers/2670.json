  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if the sorted strings are equal\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It first removes any whitespace from the strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It then sorts the characters in each string and checks if the sorted strings are equal.\n4. If the sorted strings are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input strings are anagrams. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `are_anagrams` function with example inputs.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `sorted` function has a time complexity of O(n log n) in Python. However, this is sufficient for most practical purposes, as the input strings are typically not extremely long. If you need a more efficient solution for very long strings, you can use a counter-based approach with a time complexity of O(n).",
