  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that contains all unique elements from both input arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented code that meets the requirements:\n```python\ndef combine_unique_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a new array containing all unique elements from both input arrays.\n\n    :param arr1: The first input array.\n    :param arr2: The second input array.\n    :return: A new array with all unique elements from both input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Combine both arrays into a single array\n    combined = arr1 + arr2\n    \n    # Use a set to remove duplicates and convert back to a list\n    unique_elements = list(set(combined))\n    \n    return unique_elements\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nresult = combine_unique_elements(arr1, arr2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\nThis code uses the following approaches to solve the problem:\n\n* Combining the two input arrays into a single array using the `+` operator.\n* Using a `set` to remove duplicates from the combined array. This works because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate elements.\n* Converting the set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `combine_unique_elements` function with two input arrays and print the resulting array with unique elements.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input arrays contain hashable elements (i.e., elements that can be used as keys in a dictionary). If the input arrays contain non-hashable elements (e.g., lists or dictionaries), a different approach may be needed.",
