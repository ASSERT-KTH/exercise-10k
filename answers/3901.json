  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef main():\n    a = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\n    b = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n    print(\"The sum of the two integers is: \", add_numbers(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `add_numbers` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, and returns their sum.\n*   In the `main` function, we first prompt the user to enter two integers using the `input` function.\n*   We convert the input to integers using the `int` function, and store them in the variables `a` and `b`.\n*   We then call the `add_numbers` function with `a` and `b` as arguments, and print the result.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line checks if the script is being run directly, and if so, calls the `main` function.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter two integers. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first integer: 5\nEnter the second integer: 10\nThe sum of the two integers is:  15\n```",
