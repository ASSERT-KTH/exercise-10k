  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns True if one list is a rotation of the other, and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef isRotation(lst1, lst2):\n    if len(lst1) != len(lst2):\n        return False\n    for i in range(len(lst1)):\n        if lst1 == lst2[i:] + lst2[:i]:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nprint(isRotation([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 1, 2])) # True\nprint(isRotation([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 3, 4])) # False\n```\nThis code defines the `isRotation` function, which checks if `lst1` is a rotation of `lst2`. The function first checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal, and if not, returns `False`. Then, it iterates over each possible rotation of `lst2` by slicing and concatenating the list, and checks if the resulting list is equal to `lst1`. If it finds a match, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find a match after checking all rotations, it returns `False`. The code also includes two test cases using the `print` function.",
