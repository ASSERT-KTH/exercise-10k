  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses a while loop to count consecutive occurrences of a target element in a list.\n\n```python\ndef count_consecutive(target, lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of consecutive occurrences of a target element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        target (any): The target element to count.\n        lst (list): The list to search for the target element.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of consecutive occurrences of the target element.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(lst):\n        if lst[index] == target:\n            count += 1\n            index += 1\n        else:\n            if count > 0:\n                yield count\n            count = 0\n            index += 1\n    if count > 0:\n        yield count\n\ndef main():\n    lst = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    target = 3\n    print(f\"Consecutive occurrences of {target}:\")\n    for i, count in enumerate(count_consecutive(target, lst)):\n        print(f\"Sequence {i+1}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Code Explanation:**\n\n- We define a function `count_consecutive` that takes a target element `target` and a list `lst` as arguments.\n- Inside the function, we initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the consecutive occurrences and an `index` to traverse the list.\n- We use a while loop to iterate over the list. If the current element matches the target, we increment the `count` and move to the next element.\n- If the current element does not match the target, we yield the current `count` if it's greater than 0 (indicating a sequence of the target element has ended), reset the `count` to 0, and move to the next element.\n- After the loop, we yield the final `count` if it's greater than 0 (in case the target sequence ends at the end of the list).\n- In the `main` function, we test `count_consecutive` with a sample list and target element, printing out each sequence of consecutive occurrences.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\nFor the input list `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` and target element `3`, the output will be:\n```\nConsecutive occurrences of 3:\nSequence 1: 4\n```",
