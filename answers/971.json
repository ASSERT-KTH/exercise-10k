  "prompt": "Given a dictionary and a set of required keys, write a function to check if the dictionary contains all the required keys.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to check if a dictionary contains all the required keys and provide a clear explanation of the code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef check_required_keys(dictionary, required_keys):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a dictionary contains all the required keys.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be checked.\n        required_keys (set): A set of required keys.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the dictionary contains all the required keys, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input 'dictionary' must be a dictionary.\")\n\n    # Then, we need to check if the required keys are a set\n    if not isinstance(required_keys, set):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input 'required_keys' must be a set.\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the built-in 'issubset' method of sets in Python\n    # This method returns True if all elements of the set are present in the dictionary's keys\n    # We can get the dictionary's keys using the 'keys' method\n    return required_keys.issubset(dictionary.keys())\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\nrequired_keys = {\"a\", \"b\"}\nprint(check_required_keys(my_dict, required_keys))  # Output: True\n\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\nrequired_keys = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}\nprint(check_required_keys(my_dict, required_keys))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_required_keys` first checks if the input `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary and if `required_keys` is a set, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* It then uses the `issubset` method of the `required_keys` set to check if all required keys are present in the dictionary's keys, which are obtained using the `keys` method.\n* The function returns `True` if all required keys are found in the dictionary and `False` otherwise.\n* Example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different dictionaries and sets of required keys.",
