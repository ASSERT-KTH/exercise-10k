  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in three sides of a triangle and checks if they form a valid triangle using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks if three sides form a valid triangle:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if three sides form a valid triangle.\n\n    A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The length of the first side.\n        b (float): The length of the second side.\n        c (float): The length of the third side.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the sides form a valid triangle, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if all sides are positive\n    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side\n    if (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first side: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second side: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of the third side: \"))\n\n    if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):\n        print(\"The sides form a valid triangle.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The sides do not form a valid triangle.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `is_valid_triangle` that takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.\n\n2. **Positive Sides Check**: We first check if all sides are positive. If any side is not positive, we immediately return `False`, as a triangle cannot have a side with a non-positive length.\n\n3. **Triangle Inequality Check**: We then check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem. If this condition is met for all three combinations of sides, we return `True`, indicating that the sides form a valid triangle.\n\n4. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `is_valid_triangle` function by taking user input for the lengths of the three sides and printing whether they form a valid triangle or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n- If the user inputs `3`, `4`, and `5` for the sides, the program will output: `The sides form a valid triangle.`\n- If the user inputs `1`, `2`, and `5` for the sides, the program will output: `The sides do not form a valid triangle.`",
