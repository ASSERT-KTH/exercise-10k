  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program checks the strength of a given password based on the following criteria:\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a given password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    errors = []\n\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        errors.append(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one digit.\")\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one special character.\")\n\n    # If there are any errors, print them and return False\n    if errors:\n        print(\"Password is weak.

Run the program.\n2. Enter a password when prompted.\n3. The program will check the strength of the password and print the result. If the password is weak, it will print the errors that need to be fixed.",
