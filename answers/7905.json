  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs arithmetic operations based on user input:\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is '/' and num2 is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if operation == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the operation\n        result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: The `arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operation as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n2.  **Operation Handling**: Inside the function, conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) are used to handle different operations. For division, a check is added to raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.\n3.  **Error Handling**: The function raises a `ValueError` if the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n4.  **Main Function**: The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation, calls the `arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result. It also catches and handles any errors that occur during the operation.\n5.  **User Input**: The program uses the built-in `input` function to get user input for the numbers and operation. The input is converted to a float for the numbers and a string for the operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` as the operation. The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `15` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `-` as the operation. The output will be `15 - 5 = 10.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `4` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` as the operation. The output will be `4 * 5 = 20.0`.\n*   Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` as the operation. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
