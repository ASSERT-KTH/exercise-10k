  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the temperature as input and prints the corresponding weather forecast (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) based on the following criteria: sunny (20-30), cloudy (10-19), rainy (0-9), snowy (below 0) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the corresponding weather forecast based on the given temperature.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (int): The temperature in degrees Celsius.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > 30 or temperature < -100:\n        print(\"Invalid temperature range. Please enter a temperature between -100 and 30 degrees Celsius.\")\n    elif 20 <= temperature <= 30:\n        print(\"The weather is sunny.\")\n    elif 10 <= temperature < 20:\n        print(\"The weather is cloudy.\")\n    elif 0 <= temperature < 10:\n        print(\"The weather is rainy.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The weather is snowy.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = int(input(\"Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    weather_forecast(temperature)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   This program defines a function called `weather_forecast` that takes an integer `temperature` as input.\n*   Inside the `weather_forecast` function, it checks the temperature range using if-elif-else statements and prints the corresponding weather forecast.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to enter the temperature, calls the `weather_forecast` function with the user's input, and prints the result.\n*   The program includes input validation to ensure the temperature is within a reasonable range (-100 to 30 degrees Celsius).\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the temperature when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the temperature in degrees Celsius: 25\nThe weather is sunny.\n```\n\nReplace `25` with any temperature value to see the corresponding weather forecast.",
