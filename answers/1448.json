  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of their squares.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    return sum([x**2 for x in numbers])\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of the squares of the numbers is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `sum_of_squares` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of their squares. The `sum` function is used in combination with a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the squares. The example usage shows how to use this function with a list of numbers.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `sum_of_squares` function is defined, which takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. The list comprehension `[x**2 for x in numbers]` generates a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list.\n3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the new list.\n4. The result is returned by the `sum_of_squares` function.\n5. In the example usage, a list of numbers is defined and passed to the `sum_of_squares` function.\n6. The result is printed to the console.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list contains non-numeric elements, the program will raise an error when trying to calculate the square of a non-numeric element.",
