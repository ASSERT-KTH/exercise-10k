  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their difference.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(num1 - num2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the difference\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The difference between the two numbers is: \", difference)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- The `calculate_difference` function calculates the absolute difference between two numbers.\n- The `main` function gets two numbers as input from the user and calls `calculate_difference` with these numbers.\n- The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example use cases:\n- If you input `10` and `5`, the output will be `5`.\n- If you input `5` and `10`, the output will still be `5`, because the `abs` function is used to ensure the result is always positive.",
