  "answer": "**Compressing a String by Removing Consecutive Duplicates**\n\nHere's a Python function to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef compress_string(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compress a given string by removing consecutive duplicates.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The compressed string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:  # Check if the string is empty\n        return s\n\n    compressed = [s[0]]  # Initialize the compressed list with the first character\n    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate over the string starting from the second character\n        if char != compressed[-1]:  # If the current character is different from the last one in the compressed list\n            compressed.append(char)  # Add it to the compressed list\n\n    return ''.join(compressed)  # Join the compressed list into a string and return it\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"aaaabbbccc\"\n    print(f\"Original string: {s}\")\n    print(f\"Compressed string: {compress_string(s)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We start by checking if the input string is empty. If it is, we return it as is.\n*   We initialize the `compressed` list with the first character of the input string.\n*   We then iterate over the rest of the string. For each character, we check if it's different from the last character in the `compressed` list.\n*   If it is, we add it to the `compressed` list.\n*   Finally, we join the `compressed` list into a string and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), as in the worst-case scenario, we might end up storing all characters in the `compressed` list.",
