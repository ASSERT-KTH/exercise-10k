  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) and dashes (-) based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, where each row contains a combination of asterisks and dashes. The number of rows should be determined by the user. In each row, the number of asterisks should decrease by one from the previous row, and the number of dashes should increase by one from the previous row. The first row should start with the number of asterisks specified by the user and zero dashes.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Purpose: Print a pattern of asterisks and dashes based on user input\n\n# Get the number of rows from the user\nrows = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n\n# Get the number of asterisks in the first row from the user\nasterisks = int(input(\"Enter the number of asterisks in the first row: \"))\n\n# Loop to print the pattern\nfor i in range(rows):\n    # Print asterisks\n    print(\"*\" * asterisks, end=\"\")\n\n    # Print dashes\n    print(\"-\" * i, end=\"\")\n\n    # Print a newline character\n    print()\n\n    # Decrement the number of asterisks for the next row\n    asterisks -= 1\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date comments blank for you to fill in. Also, I've used the `end=\"\"` argument in the `print` function to prevent it from printing a newline character after each row, which would result in an incorrect pattern.",
