  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n        n (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * ((1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)) - principal\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year (default=1): \") or 1)\n\n    interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount after {time} years is: ${principal + interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes in the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n2. The formula for compound interest is used: `A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where:\n\t* `A` is the amount after `t` years.\n\t* `P` is the principal amount.\n\t* `r` is the annual interest rate.\n\t* `n` is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n\t* `t` is the time period in years.\n3. The function returns the compound interest amount, which is the difference between the total amount after `t` years and the principal amount.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n5. The `calculate_compound_interest` function is called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the compound interest on a $1,000 investment with a 5% annual interest rate, compounded annually for 10 years.\n* Calculate the compound interest on a $5,000 investment with a 3% annual interest rate, compounded quarterly for 5 years.\n\n### Note\n\n* The interest rate should be entered as a decimal value (e.g. 4% = 0.04).\n* The number of times interest is compounded per year should be entered as an integer (e.g. 1 for annually, 4 for quarterly).",
