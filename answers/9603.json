The program uses the `operator` module to get the functions for basic math operations.\n2. It defines a dictionary to map operator symbols to their corresponding functions.\n3. The `evaluate_expression` function takes a math expression as input, splits it into operands and an operator, and evaluates the expression using the corresponding operator function.\n4. The `main` function gets a math expression from the user, evaluates it, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Evaluate a simple addition expression: `10 + 5`\n* Evaluate a simple subtraction expression: `10 - 5`\n* Evaluate a simple multiplication expression: `10 * 5`\n* Evaluate a simple division expression: `10 / 5`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input expression is well-formed and does not contain any invalid characters or syntax errors. It also assumes that the division operation will not result in a division by zero error. You may want to add additional error checking and handling code to make the program more robust.",
