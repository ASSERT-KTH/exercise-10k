  "answer": "**Bank Account Management Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows users to manage a bank account by performing basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, initial_balance=0.0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a bank account.\n\n        Args:\n            account_number (str): Unique account number.\n            account_name (str): Account holder's name.\n            initial_balance (float, optional): Initial account balance. Defaults to 0.0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_name = account_name\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit funds into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to deposit.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Updated account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            return self.balance\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw funds from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to withdraw.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Updated account balance if withdrawal is successful, otherwise None.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            return self.balance\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds or invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Check the current account balance.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new bank account\n    account_number = input(\"Enter account number: \")\n    account_name = input(\"Enter account holder's name: \")\n    initial_balance = float(input(\"Enter initial balance (default=0.0): \") or 0.0)\n\n    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_name, initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            new_balance = account.deposit(amount)\n            if new_balance is not None:\n                print(f\"Deposit successful.

Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program and follow the prompts to create a new bank account.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter the amount to deposit, and the program will update the account balance.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the amount to withdraw, and the program will update the account balance if the withdrawal is successful.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you exit the program.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account data and operations.\n* The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods update the account balance and return the new balance if the operation is successful.\n* The `check_balance` method returns the current account balance.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the bank account.",
