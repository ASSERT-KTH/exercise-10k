  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the quotient and remainder of two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number to be divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Take input from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate the quotient and remainder\n        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n        # Print the result\n        print(f\"The quotient of {dividend} and {divisor} is {quotient}.\")\n        print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} and {divisor} is {remainder}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function takes two numbers as input and calculates their quotient and remainder using the `//` and `%` operators, respectively.\n2. The `main` function takes two numbers as input from the user and checks for division by zero.\n3. If the divisor is not zero, it calls the `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function and prints the result.\n4. The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the program's entry point and a `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function to encapsulate the calculation logic. This makes the program more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* If the user inputs `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output:\n  + The quotient of 17 and 5 is 3.\n  + The remainder of 17 and 5 is 2.\n* If the user inputs `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor, the program will output:\n  + The quotient of 10 and 2 is 5.\n  + The remainder of 10 and 2 is 0.",
