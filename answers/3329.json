  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each element in the original list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums:\n        result.append(num ** 2)\n    return result\n\nmy_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(square_numbers(my_numbers))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `square_numbers` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input, creates an empty list `result`, iterates over each number `num` in the input list, appends the square of `num` to `result`, and returns the `result` list. The code then calls this function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints the resulting list of squares.",
