  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane, given their coordinates. This function will take the coordinates of two points as input and return the distance between them. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Parameters:\n    point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n    point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to unpack the coordinates from the input tuples\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    \n    # We do the same for the second point\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    \n    # Then, we calculate the difference in x and y coordinates\n    # This is done by subtracting the corresponding coordinates of the two points\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    \n    # Same for the y coordinates\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    \n    # The distance formula is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2), so we calculate the squares first\n    # We use the ** operator to raise a number to a power\n    dx_squared = dx ** 2\n    \n    # Same for the y difference\n    dy_squared = dy ** 2\n    \n    # Now we add the squares together\n    sum_of_squares = dx_squared + dy_squared\n    \n    # Finally, we take the square root of the sum to get the distance\n    # We use the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root\n    distance = math.sqrt(sum_of_squares)\n    \n    # We return the calculated distance\n    return distance\n\n# Example usage:\npoint1 = (1, 2)\npoint2 = (4, 6)\nprint(calculate_distance(point1, point2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_distance` takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points. It unpacks these tuples into the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.\n* It calculates the differences in x and y coordinates (`dx` and `dy`) by subtracting the corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n* The distance is then calculated using the formula `sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`, which is implemented as `math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)`.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated distance between the two points.",
