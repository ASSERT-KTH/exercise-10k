  "prompt": "Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and ask the user for their choice. Then, it should determine the winner based on the game's rules and print out the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their choice and returns it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    print(f\"You chose: {user_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Random Choice Generation**: The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer using the `random.choice` function.\n2. **User Input**: The `get_user_choice` function asks the user for their choice and ensures that the input is valid (either \"rock,\" \"paper,\" or \"scissors\").\n3. **Winner Determination**: The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and returns the result based on the game's rules.\n4. **Gameplay**: The `play_game` function orchestrates the game by generating the computer's choice, asking for the user's choice, and determining the winner.\n5. **Main Loop**: The `main` function allows the user to play multiple games by asking if they want to play again after each game.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
