  "answer": "**Grade Calculation Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function calculates a student's grade based on their score. The grade is determined by the following criteria:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score: float) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    score = 85\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"A score of {score} corresponds to a grade of {grade}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_grade` takes a single argument `score`, which is the student's score.\n2. The function uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n3. The grade is returned as a string.\n4. In the `main` function, an example score is provided, and the corresponding grade is calculated and printed.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle invalid input scores (e.g., negative numbers or scores above 100).\n* Consider adding more detailed error messages or exceptions for invalid input.\n* You can modify the grade calculation criteria to suit specific requirements.",
