  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n    width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length < 0 or width < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width cannot be negative\")\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return perimeter\n\n\ndef main():\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n    \n    try:\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user to input the length and width of the rectangle.\n2. **Validation**: It checks if the input length and width are non-negative. If either of them is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: The `calculate_perimeter` function calculates the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula `2 * (length + width)`.\n4. **Result**: The calculated perimeter is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example, if you enter `5` as the length and `3` as the width, the program will output:\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is: 16.0\n```",
