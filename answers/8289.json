  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the area and perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its sides.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the perimeter of a triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): Length of side a.\n        b (float): Length of side b.\n        c (float): Length of side c.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Perimeter of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b + c\n\n\ndef calculate_area(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): Length of side a.\n        b (float): Length of side b.\n        c (float): Length of side c.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get side lengths from user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter length of side a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter length of side b: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter length of side c: \"))\n\n    # Check if the sides can form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        print(\"The sides cannot form a valid triangle.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate perimeter and area\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        area = calculate_area(a, b, c)\n\n        # Print results\n        print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Area: {area:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_perimeter` function takes the lengths of the three sides as input and returns their sum.\n2. The `calculate_area` function uses Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is given by sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n3. In the `main` function, we first get the side lengths from the user.\n4. We then check if the sides can form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n5. If the sides can form a valid triangle, we calculate the perimeter and area using the `calculate_perimeter` and `calculate_area` functions, respectively.\n6. Finally, we print the results.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. For example, if you enter 3, 4, and 5, it will calculate and print the perimeter and area of the triangle. The output will be:\n\n```\nEnter length of side a: 3\nEnter length of side b: 4\nEnter length of side c: 5\nPerimeter: 12.00\nArea: 6.00\n```",
