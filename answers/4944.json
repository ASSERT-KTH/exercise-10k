  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks whether a given year is a leap year using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks whether a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `is_leap_year` function checks if the input year is a leap year by using the following rules:\n    *   The year can be evenly divided by 4;\n    *   If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;\n    *   The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n*   The program prompts the user to enter a year and checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function.\n*   It then prints whether the entered year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will output that the year is a leap year.\n*   Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will output that the year is not a leap year.\n*   Enter a year that is a century year but not a leap year (e.g., 2100): The program will output that the year is not a leap year.\n*   Enter a year that is a century year and a leap year (e.g., 2000): The program will output that the year is a leap year.",
