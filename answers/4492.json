  "answer": "### Calculating Tip for a Meal\n\nHere's a Python function that calculates the tip for a meal based on the total cost and a percentage.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip for a meal based on the total cost and a percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        total_cost (float): The total cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The percentage of the total cost to use as the tip.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate the input values\n    if total_cost < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Total cost cannot be negative\")\n    if tip_percentage < 0 or tip_percentage > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Tip percentage must be between 0 and 100\")\n\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * total_cost\n\n    return tip_amount\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    total_cost = 50.0  # Total cost of the meal\n    tip_percentage = 15.0  # Tip percentage\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip Percentage: {tip_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Tip Amount: ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount Due: ${total_cost + tip_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_tip` function takes two arguments: `total_cost` and `tip_percentage`.\n*   It validates the input values to ensure the total cost is not negative and the tip percentage is between 0 and 100.\n*   It calculates the tip amount by multiplying the total cost by the tip percentage divided by 100.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_tip` function with example values.\n*   It prints the total cost, tip percentage, calculated tip amount, and the total amount due (including the tip).",
