  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a score as input and converts it to a grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef convert_score_to_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a score to a grade based on the following conditions:\n    A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score to be converted.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Convert the score to a grade and print it\n    grade = convert_score_to_grade(score)\n    print(f\"Your grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `convert_score_to_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the conditions specified.\n*   The `main` function gets the score from the user, checks for valid input (a number between 0 and 100), and then calls the `convert_score_to_grade` function to get the grade.\n*   Finally, it prints out the grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n*   Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n*   Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n*   Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n*   Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a score when prompted, and it will display the corresponding grade.",
