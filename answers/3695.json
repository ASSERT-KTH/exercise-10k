  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the grade of a student based on the marks obtained in different subjects. The grade is calculated based on the average marks obtained by the student.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(marks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the average marks.\n    \n    Args:\n    marks (dict): A dictionary containing the marks obtained in different subjects.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the average marks\n    average_marks = sum(marks.values()) / len(marks)\n    \n    # Determine the grade based on the average marks\n    if average_marks >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif average_marks >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif average_marks >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif average_marks >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the marks obtained in different subjects from the user\n    num_subjects = int(input(\"Enter the number of subjects: \"))\n    marks = {}\n    for i in range(num_subjects):\n        subject = input(f\"Enter the name of subject {i+1}: \")\n        mark = float(input(f\"Enter the marks obtained in {subject}: \"))\n        marks[subject] = mark\n    \n    # Calculate and display the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(marks)\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of subjects when prompted.\n3. Enter the name and marks obtained in each subject.\n4. The program will display the grade based on the average marks.\n\n### Grade Calculation Criteria\n\n* A: 90% and above\n* B: 80-89%\n* C: 70-79%\n* D: 60-69%\n* F: Below 60%",
