  "answer": "**Countdown Timer Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a time interval in seconds as input and counts down to zero. It uses Python's `time` module to handle the timing.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef countdown(t):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts down from the given time interval to zero.\n\n    Args:\n        t (int): Time interval in seconds.\n    \"\"\"\n    while t:\n        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)\n        timer = '{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(mins, secs)\n        print(timer, end=\"\\r\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n        t -= 1\n    print('Time Up!!')\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the time interval from the user\n    t = input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \")\n\n    # Validate the input\n    try:\n        t = int(t)\n        if t < 0:\n            print(\"Time cannot be negative.\")\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n        return\n\n    # Start the countdown\n    countdown(t)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `countdown` function takes an integer `t` as input, representing the time interval in seconds.\n2. The function uses a `while` loop to count down from `t` to zero.\n3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the minutes and seconds remaining using the `divmod` function.\n4. The function prints the remaining time in the format `MM:SS` using the `print` function with the `end=\"\\r\"` argument to overwrite the current line.\n5. The function uses the `time.sleep` function to pause for one second between each iteration.\n6. Once the countdown reaches zero, the function prints \"Time Up!!\".\n7. The `main` function gets the time interval from the user, validates the input, and starts the countdown.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter a time interval in seconds when prompted.\n2. The program will start counting down from the given time interval to zero.\n3. Once the countdown reaches zero, the program will print \"Time Up!!\".\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to count down, which may not be suitable for very large time intervals due to the limitations of the `time.sleep` function. For more accurate timing, consider using a more advanced timing library or framework.",
