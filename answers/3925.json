  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\ndouble power(double a, double b) {\n    return pow(a, b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    double a, b;\n    scanf(\"%lf%lf\", &a, &b);\n    printf(\"%lf\\n\", power(a, b));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header files, defines the `power` function, and implements the `main` function as described. It reads two numbers from the input, calls the `power` function, and prints the result.",
