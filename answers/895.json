  "answer": "**Bank Account Program**\n=========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program allows a user to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of a bank account.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a bank account with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit money into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative\")\n        self.balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw money from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get the current balance of the account.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The current balance of the account.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n                account.deposit(amount)\n                print(f\"Deposit successful. New balance: {account.check_balance()}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n                print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {account.check_balance()}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: {account.check_balance()}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Deposit money into the account:\n\t* Run the program and select option 1 (Deposit).\n\t* Enter the amount to deposit (e.g., 100).\n\t* The program will display the new balance.\n2. Withdraw money from the account:\n\t* Run the program and select option 2 (Withdraw).\n\t* Enter the amount to withdraw (e.g., 50).\n\t* The program will display the new balance.\n3. Check the account balance:\n\t* Run the program and select option 3 (Check Balance).\n\t* The program will display the current balance.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance.\n* The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods modify the account balance and raise `ValueError` exceptions if the input amounts are invalid.\n* The `check_balance` method returns the current account balance.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.\n* You can extend this program by adding more features, such as storing account information in a file or database, or implementing more advanced error handling.",
