  "answer": "**Geometric Progression Sequence Generator**\n\nA geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef generate_geometric_progression(first_term, common_ratio, max_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a geometric progression sequence up to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_ratio (float): The common ratio of the sequence.\n        max_value (float): The maximum value of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers representing the geometric progression sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [first_term]\n    while True:\n        next_term = sequence[-1] * common_ratio\n        if next_term > max_value:\n            break\n        sequence.append(next_term)\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nfirst_term = 2\ncommon_ratio = 2\nmax_value = 100\n\nsequence = generate_geometric_progression(first_term, common_ratio, max_value)\nprint(sequence)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `generate_geometric_progression` that takes three arguments:\n\t* `first_term`: The first term of the sequence.\n\t* `common_ratio`: The common ratio of the sequence.\n\t* `max_value`: The maximum value of the sequence.\n2. Initialize an empty list `sequence` with the `first_term` as its first element.\n3. Enter a loop that continues until the next term in the sequence exceeds the `max_value`.\n4. In each iteration, calculate the next term by multiplying the last term in the sequence by the `common_ratio`.\n5. If the next term does not exceed the `max_value`, append it to the sequence.\n6. Once the loop exits, return the generated sequence.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Generate a geometric progression sequence with a first term of 2, a common ratio of 2, and a maximum value of 100: `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]`\n* Generate a geometric progression sequence with a first term of 3, a common ratio of 3, and a maximum value of 1000: `[3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729]`\n\nNote: You can adjust the `first_term`, `common_ratio`, and `max_value` variables to generate different geometric progression sequences.",
