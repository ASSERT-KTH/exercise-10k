  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates a number sequence based on user input:\n```\ndef generate_fibonacci_sequence(starting_number, length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        starting_number (int): The first number in the sequence.\n        length (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [starting_number, starting_number + 1]\n    while len(sequence) < length:\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n    return sequence[:length]\n\ndef generate_arithmetic_sequence(starting_number, length, common_difference):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        starting_number (int): The first number in the sequence.\n        length (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n        common_difference (int): The difference between each term.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the arithmetic sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for i in range(length):\n        sequence.append(starting_number + i * common_difference)\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Sequence Generator\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n\n    sequence_type = input(\"Enter the sequence type (fibonacci/arithmetic): \")\n    starting_number = int(input(\"Enter the starting number: \"))\n\n    if sequence_type.lower() == \"fibonacci\":\n        length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the sequence: \"))\n        sequence = generate_fibonacci_sequence(starting_number, length)\n    elif sequence_type.lower() == \"arithmetic\":\n        common_difference = int(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n        length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the sequence: \"))\n        sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(starting_number, length, common_difference)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid sequence type. Please try again.\")\n        return\n\n    print(\"Generated sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The program defines two functions: `generate_fibonacci_sequence` and `generate_arithmetic_sequence`. These functions take in the necessary parameters (starting number, length, and common difference for arithmetic sequences) and return a list of integers representing the generated sequence.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the sequence type, starting number, and length of the sequence. If the user chooses an arithmetic sequence, they are also prompted to enter the common difference.\n3. Based on the user's input, the program calls the corresponding function to generate the sequence.\n4. The generated sequence is then printed to the console.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Generate a Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and having a length of 10:\n\t+ Enter the sequence type: fibonacci\n\t+ Enter the starting number: 2\n\t+ Enter the length of the sequence: 10\n* Generate an arithmetic sequence starting with 5, having a common difference of 3, and a length of 5:\n\t+ Enter the sequence type: arithmetic\n\t+ Enter the starting number: 5\n\t+ Enter the common difference: 3\n\t+ Enter the length of the sequence: 5\n\nNote that this program assumes that the user will enter valid input. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input.",
