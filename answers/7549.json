  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following operations: calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the first two numbers, and then calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the result and the third number. The program should output the results of all these operations in a clear and readable format.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Python:\n```python\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nsum1 = a + b\nsub1 = a - b\nmul1 = a * b\ndiv1 = a / b\n\nsum2 = sum1 + c\nsub2 = sum1 - c\nmul2 = sum1 * c\ndiv2 = sum1 / c\n\nprint(f\"Sum of first two numbers: {sum1}\")\nprint(f\"Difference of first two numbers: {sub1}\")\nprint(f\"Product of first two numbers: {mul1}\")\nprint(f\"Quotient of first two numbers: {div1}\")\n\nprint(f\"Sum of first two numbers and the third number: {sum2}\")\nprint(f\"Difference of first two numbers and the third number: {sub2}\")\nprint(f\"Product of first two numbers and the third number: {mul2}\")\nprint(f\"Quotient of first two numbers and the third number: {div2}\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. Takes three numbers as input using `int(input())`.\n2. Calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the first two numbers.\n3. Calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the result of the first two numbers and the third number.\n4. Prints the results of all the operations using `print()` statements.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the inputs are integers, and it does not handle division by zero errors. If you want to handle these cases, you would need to add additional error checking code.",
