  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers and returns the results. This function will help you understand how to handle multiple return values and basic error handling in Python. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we calculate the sum of the two numbers\n    sum_result = num1 + num2  # Adding num1 and num2 and storing the result in sum_result\n\n    # Next, we calculate the difference of the two numbers\n    difference_result = num1 - num2  # Subtracting num2 from num1 and storing the result in difference_result\n\n    # Then, we calculate the product of the two numbers\n    product_result = num1 * num2  # Multiplying num1 and num2 and storing the result in product_result\n\n    # After that, we calculate the quotient of the two numbers\n    # We need to check if num2 is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n    if num2 == 0:  # Checking if num2 is zero\n        quotient_result = \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"  # If num2 is zero, we store an error message in quotient_result\n    else:\n        quotient_result = num1 / num2  # If num2 is not zero, we divide num1 by num2 and store the result in quotient_result\n\n    # Finally, we return the results as a tuple\n    return sum_result, difference_result, product_result, quotient_result  # Returning the results as a tuple\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\nsum_result, difference_result, product_result, quotient_result = calculate(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"Sum: {sum_result}\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_result}\")\nprint(f\"Product: {product_result}\")\nprint(f\"Quotient: {quotient_result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate` takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient using basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).\n* To avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`, it checks if `num2` is zero before calculating the quotient. If `num2` is zero, it returns an error message instead of attempting the division.\n* The function returns a tuple containing the results of all four operations, which can be unpacked and printed as shown in the example usage.\n* Note that the example usage demonstrates how to call the function with specific values for `num1` and `num2`, and how to print the results in a readable format.",
