  "answer": "**Word Scramble Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes a word as input, scrambles its letters, and asks the user to unscramble the word.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble the letters of a word\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the word from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n\n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n\n    # Ask the user to unscramble the word\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n\n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    if answer.lower() == word.lower():\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program and enter a word when prompted.\n2. The program will scramble the word and ask you to unscramble it.\n3. Enter your answer and press Enter.\n4. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list using `random.shuffle`, and then joins the list back into a string.\n2. The `main` function gets the word from the user, scrambles it using `scramble_word`, and asks the user to unscramble it.\n3. The user's answer is compared to the original word (case-insensitive) to determine whether it is correct or not.",
