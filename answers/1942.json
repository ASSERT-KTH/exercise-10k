  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second index.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef list_slice(lst, start, stop):\n    return lst[start:stop]\n```\nThis function takes three parameters: `lst` (the list), `start` (the starting index), and `stop` (the ending index). It uses Python's list slicing syntax `lst[start:stop]` to extract a slice of the list from the `start` index to the `stop` index.\n\nYou can call this function with a list and two indices, like this:\n```\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(list_slice(my_list, 1, 3))  # Output: [2, 3]\n```\nNote that, as mentioned in the specification, the `stop` index is exclusive, meaning that the element at the `stop` index is not included in the returned slice. In this example, the element at index 3 (which is 4) is not included in the returned slice.",
