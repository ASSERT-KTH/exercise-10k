  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the price after a discount is applied given the original price and the discount percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the price after a discount is applied.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The price after the discount is applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    if original_price < 0 or discount_percentage < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Original price and discount percentage must be non-negative.\")\n\n    if discount_percentage > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Discount percentage cannot exceed 100%.\")\n\n    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage\n    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount\n\n    return discounted_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    original_price = 100.0\n    discount_percentage = 20.0\n\n    try:\n        discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)\n        print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n        print(f\"Discounted Price: ${discounted_price:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_discounted_price` function takes two arguments: `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n2. It checks if the `original_price` and `discount_percentage` are non-negative and if the `discount_percentage` does not exceed 100%.\n3. It calculates the `discount_amount` by multiplying the `original_price` by the `discount_percentage` divided by 100.\n4. It calculates the `discounted_price` by subtracting the `discount_amount` from the `original_price`.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_discounted_price` function with an example.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nOriginal Price: $100.00\nDiscount Percentage: 20.0%\nDiscounted Price: $80.00\n```",
