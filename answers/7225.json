  "prompt": "Write a program to count the number of fruits in a basket. The program will receive a list of fruits as input and output the total count. Use a for loop to iterate over the list.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that counts the number of fruits in a basket.\n\n```python\ndef count_fruits(fruit_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of fruits in a basket.\n\n    Args:\n        fruit_list (list): A list of fruits.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total count of fruits.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_count = 0\n    for fruit in fruit_list:\n        total_count += 1\n    return total_count\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\", \"Elderberry\"]\n    print(\"Fruits in the basket: \", fruits)\n    print(\"Total count of fruits: \", count_fruits(fruits))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `count_fruits` that takes a list of fruits as input and returns the total count. We use a for loop to iterate over the list and increment the `total_count` variable for each fruit. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `count_fruits` function with an example list of fruits. \n\nHowever, please note that this program can be simplified by using the built-in `len` function in Python, which returns the number of items in a list. Here's the simplified version:\n\n```python\ndef count_fruits(fruit_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of fruits in a basket.\n\n    Args:\n        fruit_list (list): A list of fruits.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total count of fruits.\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(fruit_list)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\", \"Elderberry\"]\n    print(\"Fruits in the basket: \", fruits)\n    print(\"Total count of fruits: \", count_fruits(fruits))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version achieves the same result but is more concise and efficient.",
