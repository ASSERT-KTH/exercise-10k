  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using a for loop. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` since these numbers are not prime.\n3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` by using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).\n5. If `n` is divisible by any `i`, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n7. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number (e.g., 23) to see the program output: \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number (e.g., 24) to see the program output: \"24 is not a prime number.\"\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1 (e.g., 0) to see the program output: \"0 is not a prime number.\"",
