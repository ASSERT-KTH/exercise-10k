  "prompt": "Write a program that takes four numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. The program should then output the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid operation(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n    int addition = a + b + c + d;\n    int subtraction = a - b - c - d;\n    int multiplication = a * b * c * d;\n    int division = (float)a / (float)b / (float)c / (float)d;\n\n    std::cout << \"a + b + c + d = \" << addition << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"a - b - c - d = \" << subtraction << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"a * b * c * d = \" << multiplication << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"a / b / c / d = \" << division << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, c, d;\n    std::cout << \"Enter four numbers: \";\n    std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    operation(a, b, c, d);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header file (`<iostream>`), defines the `operation` function, and defines the `main` function. The `main` function prompts the user to input four numbers, calls the `operation` function with these numbers, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution. The `operation` function performs the arithmetic operations and outputs the results to the console using `std::cout`.",
