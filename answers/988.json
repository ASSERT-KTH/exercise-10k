  "answer": "**Hangman Game in Python**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Hangman with the user. It generates a random word from a predefined list, and the user tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. After each guess, the program tells the user if the letter appears in the word or not.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nword_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word)\n\n    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores\n    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length\n    guessed_letters = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(display_hangman(tries))\n    print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Please guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) != 1:\n            print(\"Please guess one letter at a time.\")\n        elif guess in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You already guessed this letter.\")\n        elif guess not in word:\n            tries -= 1\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            print(f\"Incorrect!

Save the code in a file named `hangman.py`.\n2. Run the file using Python: `python hangman.py`.\n3. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display a random word with underscores representing each letter. You can guess a letter by typing it in, and the program will tell you if it appears in the word or not. If you guess a letter correctly, it will fill in the corresponding underscore(s). If you run out of tries, the program will reveal the correct word.",
