  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a grouping function as input, and returns a dictionary with the grouped elements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef group_list(input_list, f):\n    result = {}\n    for key, group in groupby(sorted(input_list, key=f), f):\n        result[key] = list(group)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nprint(group_list(my_list, lambda x: x % 2))\n```\nThis code defines the `group_list` function, which takes an `input_list` and a `f` function as input, sorts the list using the `f` function, groups the sorted list using `groupby`, and constructs a dictionary with the grouped elements. The example usage shows how to use the `group_list` function to group a list of integers by their remainder when divided by 2.",
