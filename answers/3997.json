  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Finder**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    strings = [\"hello\", \"hello world\", \"hello python\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hello\"\n\n    strings = [\"apple\", \"apply\", \"april\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"ap\"\n\n    strings = [\"\", \"hello\", \"world\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2.  Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3.  Iterate over each character in the shortest string.\n4.  For each character, check if it is the same in all other strings at the same position.\n5.  If a mismatch is found, return the prefix up to the mismatched character.\n6.  If no mismatch is found after checking all characters, return the entire shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string. This is because we are iterating over each character in the shortest string and checking it against all other strings.",
