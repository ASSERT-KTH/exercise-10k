  "answer": "**Longest Word Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string as input, splits it into words, and returns the longest word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_word(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest word in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to find the longest word in.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest word in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Initialize the longest word and its length\n    longest_word = max(words, key=len)\n\n    return longest_word\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"This is a test string with multiple words\"\nprint(longest_word(input_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes an input string and splits it into words using the `split()` method.\n2. It uses the `max()` function with the `key=len` argument to find the longest word in the list of words.\n3. The longest word is returned by the function.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This function assumes that words are separated by spaces. If words can be separated by other characters (e.g., tabs, commas), you may need to adjust the `split()` method accordingly.\n* If there are multiple longest words (i.e., words with the same maximum length), this function will return one of them. If you need to return all longest words, you will need to modify the function accordingly.",
