  "answer": "**Luhn Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nThe Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. Here is a Python implementation of the Luhn algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any non-digit characters from the card number\n    card_number = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, card_number))\n\n    # Check if the card number has at least 13 and at most 19 digits\n    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 19:\n        return False\n\n    # Convert the card number to a list of integers\n    digits = [int(d) for d in card_number]\n\n    # Reverse the list of digits\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(digits), 2):\n        digits[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if digits[i] > 9:\n            digits[i] -= 9\n\n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    return sum(digits) % 10 == 0\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    card_number = \"4532015112830366\"\n    if validate_credit_card(card_number):\n        print(f\"The credit card number {card_number} is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The credit card number {card_number} is not valid.\")\n```\n\n**How the Luhn Algorithm Works**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.  Remove any non-digit characters from the credit card number.\n2.  Check if the credit card number has at least 13 and at most 19 digits.\n3.  Reverse the digits of the credit card number.\n4.  Double every second digit of the reversed credit card number.\n5.  If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the product.\n6.  Calculate the sum of all the digits.\n7.  If the sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is valid.\n\n**Note:** The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula and does not guarantee that a credit card number is active or has sufficient funds. It only checks if the number is valid according to the algorithm.",
