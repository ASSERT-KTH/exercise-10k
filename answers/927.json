  "answer": "**Simple Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program uses if/else statements to perform basic arithmetic operations.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \"))\n\n    if choice == 1:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    elif choice == 2:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    elif choice == 3:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    elif choice == 4:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        if num2 != 0:\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    again = input(\"Do you want to calculate again? (yes/no): \")\n    if again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        main()\n    else:\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The program first prints a menu with four options: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. The user is prompted to enter their choice.\n3. Based on the user's choice, the program asks for two numbers and performs the corresponding operation.\n4. If the user chooses division, the program checks if the second number is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n5. The result of the operation is printed to the console.\n6. The program asks the user if they want to calculate again. If they answer \"yes\", the program starts over. If they answer \"no\", the program ends.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* Addition: Enter `1` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `5` and `3`. The program will print `5 + 3 = 8.0`.\n* Subtraction: Enter `2` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `10` and `4`. The program will print `10 - 4 = 6.0`.\n* Multiplication: Enter `3` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `6` and `7`. The program will print `6 * 7 = 42.0`.\n* Division: Enter `4` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `12` and `3`. The program will print `12 / 3 = 4.0`. If you enter `0` as the second number, the program will print an error message.",
