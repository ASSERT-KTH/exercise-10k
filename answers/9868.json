  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that responds to basic user input with predefined responses.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with user inputs as keys and responses as values\nresponses = {\n    \"hello\": \"Hi, how are you?\",\n    \"how are you\": \"I'm doing great, thanks!\",\n    \"what's your name\": \"I'm a chatbot, nice to meet you!\",\n    \"goodbye\": \"See you later, have a great day!\",\n    \"help\": \"I can understand the following commands: hello, how are you, what's your name, goodbye\"\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Returns a predefined response based on the user's input\"\"\"\n    user_input = user_input.lower()  # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching\n    return responses.get(user_input, \"Sorry, I didn't understand that. Type 'help' for available commands.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'help' for available commands.\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        response = get_response(user_input)\n        print(\"Chatbot:\", response)\n        if user_input.lower() == \"goodbye\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `responses` where keys are user inputs and values are the corresponding responses.\n2. The `get_response` function takes the user's input, converts it to lowercase, and looks up the response in the `responses` dictionary. If the input is not found, it returns a default message.\n3. The `main` function runs an infinite loop where it continuously prompts the user for input and prints the chatbot's response.\n4. If the user types \"goodbye\", the loop breaks, and the program ends.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```\nWelcome to the chatbot! Type 'help' for available commands.\nYou: hello\nChatbot: Hi, how are you?\nYou: how are you\nChatbot: I'm doing great, thanks!\nYou: help\nChatbot: I can understand the following commands: hello, how are you, what's your name, goodbye\nYou: goodbye\nChatbot: See you later, have a great day!\n```",
