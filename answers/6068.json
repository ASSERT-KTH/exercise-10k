  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers based on a given formula using a while loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    i = 2\n\n    while i < n:\n        next_term = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]\n        sequence.append(next_term)\n        i += 1\n\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Number of terms in the sequence\n    fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(n)\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `fibonacci_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the sequence.\n2. The function initializes a list `sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n3. The while loop starts from `i=2` and runs until `i` reaches `n`.\n4. Inside the loop, the next Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the previous two numbers (`sequence[i-1]` and `sequence[i-2]`).\n5. The new Fibonacci number is appended to the `sequence` list.\n6. The loop increments `i` by 1 and repeats until the desired number of terms is reached.\n7. The function returns the completed Fibonacci sequence as a list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to generate a Fibonacci sequence using a while loop. You can adjust the value of `n` to generate sequences of different lengths.",
