  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is odd. Use a for loop or a while loop to achieve this.",
  "answer": "**Odd Number Printer Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print the odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\n# Define the start and end of the range\nstart = 1\nend = 10\n\n# Use a for loop to iterate over the range\nfor num in range(start, end + 1):\n    # Check if the number is odd\n    if num % 2 != 0:\n        # Print the odd number\n        print(num)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines the start and end of the range (1 to 10).\n2. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers.\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is not 0, the number is odd.\n4. If the number is odd, it prints the number.\n\n**Example Output**\n----------------\n\n```\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n```\n\n**Alternative Implementation using While Loop**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you prefer to use a while loop, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the start and end of the range\nstart = 1\nend = 10\n\n# Initialize the current number\nnum = start\n\n# Use a while loop to iterate over the range\nwhile num <= end:\n    # Check if the number is odd\n    if num % 2 != 0:\n        # Print the odd number\n        print(num)\n    # Increment the current number\n    num += 1\n```",
