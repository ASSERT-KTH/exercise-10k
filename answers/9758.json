  "answer": "**Calculating Cost of Goods after Tax**\n======================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the cost of goods after tax.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cost_after_tax(cost_before_tax, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cost of goods after tax.\n\n    Args:\n        cost_before_tax (float): The cost of goods before tax.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The cost of goods after tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = cost_before_tax * tax_rate\n    cost_after_tax = cost_before_tax + tax_amount\n    return cost_after_tax\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    cost_before_tax = float(input(\"Enter the cost of goods before tax: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 8 for 8%): \"))\n    tax_rate = tax_rate / 100  # Convert tax rate to decimal\n\n    # Calculate cost after tax\n    cost_after_tax = calculate_cost_after_tax(cost_before_tax, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Cost before tax: ${cost_before_tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax rate: {tax_rate*100}%\")\n    print(f\"Tax amount: ${cost_before_tax * tax_rate:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Cost after tax: ${cost_after_tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of goods before tax (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 8 for 8%).\n4. The program will calculate and print the cost of goods after tax, including the tax amount.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_cost_after_tax` function takes two arguments: `cost_before_tax` and `tax_rate`.\n2. It calculates the tax amount by multiplying the cost before tax by the tax rate.\n3. It calculates the cost after tax by adding the tax amount to the cost before tax.\n4. The `main` function gets user input for the cost before tax and tax rate, converts the tax rate to a decimal, and calls the `calculate_cost_after_tax` function to calculate the cost after tax.\n5. It then prints the result, including the cost before tax, tax rate, tax amount, and cost after tax.",
