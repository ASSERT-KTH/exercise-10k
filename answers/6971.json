  "answer": "### Caesar Cipher Encryption Function\n#### Description\nThis function takes a string and a shift as arguments and returns the Caesar cipher encrypted string.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher_encrypt(text: str, shift: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Encrypts a given string using the Caesar cipher algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    text (str): The input string to be encrypted.\n    shift (int): The number of positions each letter in the text should be shifted.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The encrypted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for char in text:\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character, and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + shift) % 26 + ord('A'))\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character, and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))\n        # If the character is not a letter, add it to the result as is\n        else:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = \"Hello, World!\"\n    shift = 3\n    encrypted_text = caesar_cipher_encrypt(text, shift)\n    print(f\"Text: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Shift: {shift}\")\n    print(f\"Encrypted Text: {encrypted_text}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `caesar_cipher_encrypt` takes two arguments, `text` and `shift`, where `text` is the input string to be encrypted and `shift` is the number of positions each letter in the text should be shifted.\n2. It iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is a letter, it calculates the new character by shifting it by the specified amount. It uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of the character and the `chr` function to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n4. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result as is.\n5. The function returns the encrypted string.\n\n#### Note\nThis implementation only shifts letters and leaves other characters (such as punctuation and spaces) unchanged. The shift is also circular, meaning that if the shift would move a letter past 'z' or 'Z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.",
