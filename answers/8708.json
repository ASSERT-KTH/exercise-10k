The correct answer is {options['correct']}.\")\n            score -= 5\n\n        print(f\"Your current score is: {score}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nGame over! Your final score is: {score}\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Quiz Master!\")\n    play_game()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1.
