  "answer": "### Merging Dictionaries with Overlapping Keys\n#### Problem Description\nMerging two dictionaries with overlapping keys requires a careful approach to handle the overlapping keys. We can either overwrite the values of the first dictionary with the values of the second dictionary or combine the values in some way.\n\n#### Solution\nHere's a Python function that merges two dictionaries with overlapping keys. This function uses the `update()` method to merge the dictionaries and overwrite the values of the first dictionary with the values of the second dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries with overlapping keys.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: The merged dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the first dictionary\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    \n    # Update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    \n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}\n\nmerged_dict = merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to combine the values of overlapping keys in some way, you can use a different approach. For example, you can use a dictionary comprehension to combine the values into lists:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries with overlapping keys, combining values into lists.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: The merged dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a set of all keys from both dictionaries\n    all_keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n    \n    # Create a new dictionary with combined values\n    merged_dict = {key: [dict1.get(key), dict2.get(key)] for key in all_keys}\n    \n    # Remove None values from the lists\n    merged_dict = {key: [value for value in values if value is not None] for key, values in merged_dict.items()}\n    \n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}\n\nmerged_dict = merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': [1], 'b': [2, 20], 'c': [3, 30], 'd': [40]}\n```\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the values are hashable and can be combined into lists. If the values are not hashable or require a different way of combination, you may need to adjust the approach accordingly.",
