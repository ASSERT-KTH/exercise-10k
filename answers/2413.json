  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns a closure, capturing its environment, and then calling this function with an input value to print the result. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(input_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns a closure that captures its environment.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_value (any): The value to be captured by the closure.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A closure that captures the input value and returns it when called.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We define an inner function that will capture the environment of the outer function.\n    def inner_function():\n        # The inner function returns the input value passed to the outer function.\n        return input_value\n    \n    # The outer function returns the inner function, which is now a closure.\n    return inner_function\n\n# We call the outer function with an input value and store the returned closure in a variable.\nclosure = outer_function(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# We call the closure and print the result.\nprint(closure())  # Output: Hello, World!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `outer_function` takes an `input_value` and defines an `inner_function` that captures this value, creating a closure when `outer_function` returns `inner_function`.\n* The `inner_function` simply returns the `input_value` it captured from the environment of `outer_function`.\n* By calling `outer_function` with a specific `input_value` and storing the result in the `closure` variable, we can later call `closure()` to retrieve the captured `input_value`.\n* This process demonstrates how closures can encapsulate and return values from their surrounding environment, even after the outer function has completed execution.",
