  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a rotation amount as input and returns a new array containing the same elements rotated by the specified amount.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef rotate_array(arr, num_positions):\n    new_arr = arr[num_positions:] + arr[:num_positions]\n    return new_arr\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnum_positions = 2\nprint(rotate_array(arr, num_positions))  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\n```\nThis code defines the `rotate_array` function, which takes two arguments: `arr` (the input array) and `num_positions` (the number of positions to rotate the array). The function creates a new array `new_arr` by slicing the input array and concatenating the two parts. The function then returns the new array.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the code creates an input array `arr` with the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, sets `num_positions` to 2, and calls the `rotate_array` function with these values. The output of the function is printed to the console, which should be `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.\n\nNote that this code uses a simple and efficient approach to rotate the array, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.",
