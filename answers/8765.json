  "answer": "**Least Frequent Character Function**\n======================================\n\nHere's a Python function that finds the least frequent character in a given string.\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef least_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the least frequent character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The least frequent character.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n\n    # Find the character with the minimum frequency\n    least_frequent = min(char_count, key=char_count.get)\n\n    return least_frequent\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(f\"The least frequent character in '{s}' is '{least_frequent_char(s)}'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `least_frequent_char` takes a string `s` as input and removes any whitespace.\n2. It converts the string to lowercase to ensure the function is case-insensitive.\n3. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character.\n4. It uses the `min` function with the `key` argument set to `char_count.get` to find the character with the minimum frequency.\n5. The function returns the least frequent character.\n\n### Notes\n\n* If there are multiple characters with the same minimum frequency, this function will return one of them. If you need to return all characters with the minimum frequency, you can modify the function to return a list of characters instead.",
