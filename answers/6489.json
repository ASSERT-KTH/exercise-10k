  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then ask the user for their choice. After the user enters their choice, print out the result of the game.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Ask the user for their choice\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(computer_choice, user_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if computer_choice == user_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (computer_choice == \"rock\" and user_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (computer_choice == \"scissors\" and user_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (computer_choice == \"paper\" and user_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n    return \"User wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of rock, paper, scissors\"\"\"\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    print(f\"User chose: {user_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(computer_choice, user_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer using the `random.choice` function.\n2. The `get_user_choice` function asks the user for their choice and validates the input to ensure it's one of the allowed choices (rock, paper, or scissors).\n3. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner of the game based on the computer's choice and the user's choice. It uses a simple set of rules to determine the winner:\n   * If both choices are the same, it's a tie.\n   * If the computer's choice beats the user's choice (e.g., rock beats scissors), the computer wins.\n   * Otherwise, the user wins.\n4. The `main` function plays a game of rock, paper, scissors by generating the computer's choice, asking the user for their choice, and then determining the winner.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter \"rock\" when prompted. The program will generate a random choice for the computer and print out the result of the game.\n* Run the program and enter an invalid choice (e.g., \"foo\"). The program will ask you to try again until you enter a valid choice.",
