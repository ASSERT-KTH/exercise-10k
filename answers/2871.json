  "answer": "### Character Frequency Counter Function\n\nHere's a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique characters in the string and the values are their corresponding frequencies.\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequencies(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the unique characters in the string\n              and the values are their corresponding frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequencies(input_str)\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"Character '{char}': {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution Using Python's Built-in `collections` Module\n\nIf you want a more concise solution, you can use the `Counter` class from Python's `collections` module.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_character_frequencies(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the unique characters in the string\n              and the values are their corresponding frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(Counter(input_string))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequencies(input_str)\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"Character '{char}': {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
