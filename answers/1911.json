  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.\n        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed in gallons.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumed == 0:\n        return 0\n    return distance / fuel_consumed\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Fuel Efficiency Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed in gallons: \"))\n\n    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)\n\n    print(f\"Fuel Efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `fuel_consumed`.\n2. It checks if `fuel_consumed` is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. If `fuel_consumed` is not zero, it calculates the fuel efficiency by dividing `distance` by `fuel_consumed`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n5. It calls the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the fuel efficiency of a car that traveled 250 miles and consumed 10 gallons of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 250`, `fuel_consumed = 10`\n\t+ Output: `Fuel Efficiency: 25.00 miles per gallon`\n* Calculate the fuel efficiency of a truck that traveled 500 miles and consumed 20 gallons of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 500`, `fuel_consumed = 20`\n\t+ Output: `Fuel Efficiency: 25.00 miles per gallon`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the distance traveled and fuel consumed are non-negative values.",
