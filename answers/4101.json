  "answer": "### Declaring Variables and Printing a Greeting Message\n\nBelow is an example code snippet in Python that declares variables for a student's name and age, then prints out a greeting message including the name and age.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables for student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out a greeting message including the name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, my name is {student_name} and I am {student_age} years old.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: We declare two variables, `student_name` and `student_age`, using the assignment operator (`=`). The `student_name` variable is assigned a string value, and the `student_age` variable is assigned an integer value.\n2. **Printing the Greeting Message**: We use the `print()` function with an f-string to format the greeting message. The f-string allows us to embed expressions inside string literals, using the `f` prefix before the string.\n3. **String Formatting**: The `{student_name}` and `{student_age}` are placeholders that are replaced with the actual values of the variables.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.\n```",
