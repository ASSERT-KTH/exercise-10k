  "answer": "**Color Message Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a favorite color as input and prints out a personalized message.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_color_message(color):\n    \"\"\"Prints a message with the given color.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Your favorite color is {color}! That's a great choice.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Gets the favorite color from the user and prints the message.\"\"\"\n    color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n    print_color_message(color)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter your favorite color (e.g., \"blue\").\n3. The program will print a message with your favorite color (e.g., \"Your favorite color is blue! That's a great choice.\").\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `print_color_message` function takes a color as input and prints a message with the color.\n2. The `main` function gets the favorite color from the user using the `input` function.\n3. The `main` function calls `print_color_message` with the user's favorite color.\n\nNote: This program uses Python 3.x syntax. If you're using an earlier version, you may need to modify the code accordingly.",
