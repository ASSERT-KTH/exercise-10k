  "answer": "**Database Input Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program takes input from the user and writes it to a SQLite database.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n-----------------\n\n* Python 3.8+\n* sqlite3 library (comes pre-installed with Python)\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database\ndef connect_to_database(db_name):\n    \"\"\"Connect to the SQLite database.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)\n        return conn\n    except sqlite3.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error connecting to database: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Create a table in the database\ndef create_table(conn, table_name):\n    \"\"\"Create a table in the database.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(f\"\"\"\n            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} (\n                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n                name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                email TEXT NOT NULL\n            )\n        \"\"\")\n        conn.commit()\n    except sqlite3.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error creating table: {e}\")\n\n# Insert data into the database\ndef insert_data(conn, table_name, name, email):\n    \"\"\"Insert data into the database.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(f\"\"\"\n            INSERT INTO {table_name} (name, email)\n            VALUES (?, ?)\n        \"\"\", (name, email))\n        conn.commit()\n    except sqlite3.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error inserting data: {e}\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    db_name = \"user_database.db\"\n    table_name = \"users\"\n\n    # Connect to the database\n    conn = connect_to_database(db_name)\n    if conn is None:\n        return\n\n    # Create a table in the database\n    create_table(conn, table_name)\n\n    while True:\n        # Get user input\n        name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n        email = input(\"Enter your email: \")\n\n        # Insert data into the database\n        insert_data(conn, table_name, name, email)\n\n        # Ask the user if they want to continue\n        response = input(\"Do you want to continue? (yes/no): \")\n        if response.lower() != \"yes\":\n            break\n\n    # Close the database connection\n    conn.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your name and email when prompted.\n3. The program will insert the data into the database.\n4. You will be asked if you want to continue. If you answer \"yes\", you can enter more data. If you answer \"no\", the program will exit.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* This program uses a SQLite database, which is a lightweight disk-based database library.\n* The program creates a table called \"users\" with columns for \"id\", \"name\", and \"email\".\n* The program uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* The program will continue to prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.",
