  "prompt": "Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\n<?php\n$a = 0;\n$b = 1;\n\nwhile ($a < 100) {\n    echo $a . \" \";\n    $b = $a + $b;\n    $a = $b - $a;\n}\n?>\n```\nThis code generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number and prints it out, separated by spaces. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
