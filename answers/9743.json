  "answer": "**Division Program**\n======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that takes two numbers as input, divides the first number by the second, and prints the quotient and remainder.\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Divide 10 by 2:\n\t+ Input: `dividend = 10`, `divisor = 2`\n\t+ Output: `10 divided by 2 is 5.0 with a remainder of 0.0`\n* Divide 17 by 5:\n\t+ Input: `dividend = 17`, `divisor = 5`\n\t+ Output: `17 divided by 5 is 3.0 with a remainder of 2.0`\n* Attempt to divide by zero:\n\t+ Input: `dividend = 10`, `divisor = 0`\n\t+ Output: `Cannot divide by zero`\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* This program uses the `//` operator for integer division (i.e., it rounds down to the nearest whole number) and the `%` operator to calculate the remainder.\n* It also includes a check to prevent division by zero, raising a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero.\n* The program uses a `try`-`except` block to catch and handle the `ZeroDivisionError` exception.",
