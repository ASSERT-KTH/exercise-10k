  "answer": "**Generating Factorials using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example Python code snippet that generates a list of factorials up to a given limit.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_factorials(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a list of factorials up to a given limit.\n\n    Args:\n    limit (int): The maximum number for which the factorial is calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of factorials up to the given limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    factorials = []\n    factorial = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, limit + 1):\n        factorial *= i\n        factorials.append(factorial)\n\n    return factorials\n\n# Example usage\nlimit = 5\nfactorials = generate_factorials(limit)\nprint(\"Factorials up to\", limit, \"are:\", factorials)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `generate_factorials` that takes an integer `limit` as input.\n2. Initialize an empty list `factorials` to store the calculated factorials and a variable `factorial` to keep track of the current factorial value.\n3. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to the given `limit`.\n4. Inside the loop, update the `factorial` value by multiplying it with the current number `i`.\n5. Append the updated `factorial` value to the `factorials` list.\n6. After the loop, return the `factorials` list.\n7. In the example usage, set the `limit` to 5 and call the `generate_factorials` function to generate the list of factorials up to 5.\n8. Print the resulting list of factorials.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the code with a limit of 5, the output will be:\n```\nFactorials up to 5 are: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]\n```\n\nThis output represents the factorials of numbers from 1 to 5, where:\n\n* 1! = 1\n* 2! = 2\n* 3! = 6\n* 4! = 24\n* 5! = 120",
