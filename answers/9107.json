If the student has no grades, it displays a message indicating that.\n*   The `display_records` method displays all student records, including their names and grades.\n*   The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the `StudentRecords` class. It continues to prompt the user for input until they choose to quit.",
