  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list that is the sorted version of the original list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the built-in sorting functionality to create a new sorted list:\n\n```python\ndef sort_list(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a new sorted list from the input list.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    input_list (list): The list that needs to be sorted.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(input_list)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", input_list)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sort_list(input_list))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function named `sort_list` that takes an input list as a parameter.\n*   Inside the function, we use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the input list in ascending order.\n*   The sorted list is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we create a list of integers, print the original list, and then print the sorted list returned by our `sort_list` function.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n*   The time complexity of the `sorted()` function in Python is O(n log n) on average, where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it efficient for sorting large lists.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n*   The space complexity of the `sorted()` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the function creates a new sorted list, which requires additional space.",
