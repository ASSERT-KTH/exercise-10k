  "prompt": "Write a function to implement a Caesar cipher, which shifts each character in a string by a specified number of positions. The function should take a string and a shift value as input, and return the encrypted string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef encrypt(text, shift):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\nshift = 3\nprint(encrypt(text, shift))\n```\nThis code defines the `encrypt` function, which takes a string `text` and an integer `shift` as input, and returns the encrypted string. It then calls the `encrypt` function with the specified `text` and `shift` values, and prints the result.\n\nNote that I've followed the exact logic described in the specification, including the use of `ord` and `chr` functions to convert characters to ASCII values and vice versa, and the modulo operator to handle wrapping around the alphabet. I've also included the example usage at the end to demonstrate how to use the `encrypt` function.",
