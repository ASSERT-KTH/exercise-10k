  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that defines a function `aggregate` which takes a list and an aggregation function as input, and returns the aggregated value:\n\n```python\ndef aggregate(lst, agg_func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function aggregates a list using a specified aggregation function.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list to be aggregated.\n        agg_func (function): The aggregation function to be used.\n\n    Returns:\n        The aggregated value.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lst:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    # Check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(lst, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Check if the aggregation function is callable\n    if not callable(agg_func):\n        raise TypeError(\"Aggregation function must be callable\")\n\n    return agg_func(lst)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import statistics\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = aggregate(numbers, statistics.mean)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = aggregate(numbers, statistics.median)\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum\n    sum_numbers = aggregate(numbers, sum)\n    print(f\"Sum: {sum_numbers}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define the `aggregate` function, which takes a list `lst` and an aggregation function `agg_func` as input.\n2.  We perform error checking to ensure that the input list is not empty and that the aggregation function is callable.\n3.  We apply the aggregation function to the input list using the `agg_func(lst)` syntax, which returns the aggregated value.\n4.  We provide example usage in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, demonstrating how to use the `aggregate` function with different aggregation functions like `statistics.mean`, `statistics.median`, and the built-in `sum` function.",
