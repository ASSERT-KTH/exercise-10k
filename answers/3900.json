  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a directory path as input and organizes the files in the directory based on their extensions.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for organizing files based on their extensions. This script will create separate folders for each file extension and move the corresponding files into those folders.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndef organize_files(directory_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Organizes files in a directory based on their extensions.\n\n    Args:\n        directory_path (str): The path to the directory to be organized.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the directory exists\n    if not os.path.exists(directory_path):\n        print(\"The specified directory does not exist.\")\n        return\n\n    # Iterate over each file in the directory\n    for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):\n        # Get the file path\n        file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, filename)\n\n        # Check if it's a file (not a directory)\n        if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n            # Get the file extension\n            file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1][1:]\n\n            # Create a directory for the file extension if it doesn't exist\n            extension_dir = os.path.join(directory_path, file_extension)\n            if not os.path.exists(extension_dir):\n                os.makedirs(extension_dir)\n\n            # Move the file to the extension directory\n            shutil.move(file_path, extension_dir)\n            print(f\"Moved {filename} to {extension_dir}\")\n\n    print(\"File organization complete.\")\n\ndef main():\n    directory_path = input(\"Enter the directory path: \")\n    organize_files(directory_path)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to use this program\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the directory path when prompted.\n3. The program will organize the files in the directory based on their extensions.\n\n### Example use case\n\nLet's say you have a directory called `Downloads` with the following files:\n- `document.pdf`\n- `image.jpg`\n- `video.mp4`\n- `document2.pdf`\n- `image2.jpg`\n\nAfter running the program and entering the path to the `Downloads` directory, the program will create the following structure:\n- `Downloads`\n    - `pdf`\n        - `document.pdf`\n        - `document2.pdf`\n    - `jpg`\n        - `image.jpg`\n        - `image2.jpg`\n    - `mp4`\n        - `video.mp4`\n\nNote: This program will move all files in the specified directory into separate folders based on their extensions. It does not handle subdirectories. If you need to organize files in subdirectories as well, you would need to modify the program to recursively traverse the directory tree.",
