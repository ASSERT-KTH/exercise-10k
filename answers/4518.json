  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates a calendar for a given month and year. This program uses the built-in `calendar` module in Python.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef generate_calendar(year, month):\n    \"\"\"Generate a calendar for a given month and year.\"\"\"\n    # Create a plain text calendar\n    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Print the month and year\n    print(calendar.month_name[month], year)\n    print(\"Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\")\n\n    # Print the calendar\n    for week in cal:\n        for day in week:\n            if day == 0:\n                print(\"  \", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{day:2d}\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    generate_calendar(year, month)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_calendar` function takes in two parameters, `year` and `month`, which represent the year and month for which the calendar should be generated.\n2. Inside the function, we use `calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)` to create a matrix representing a month\u2019s calendar. Each row represents a week; days outside of the month are represented by zeros.\n3. We then print the month and year using `calendar.month_name[month]`.\n4. We print the days of the week.\n5. We iterate over each week in the calendar and print each day. If the day is zero, we print two spaces to align the output correctly.\n6. In the `main` function, we ask the user for the year and month, convert the input to integers, and call `generate_calendar` with these values.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* To generate a calendar for January 2024, enter `2024` when prompted for the year and `1` when prompted for the month.\n* To generate a calendar for December 2023, enter `2023` when prompted for the year and `12` when prompted for the month.\n\nYou can run this program, enter the desired year and month when prompted, and it will display a calendar for that month and year.",
