  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the GCD\n    print(\"The greatest common divisor of {} and {} is {}.\".format(num1, num2, gcd(num1, num2)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor.\n\n1. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` is 0.\n2. In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively.\n3. Once `b` is 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor.\n\nThe `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calculates their GCD using the `gcd` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example usage\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 48\nEnter the second number: 18\nThe greatest common divisor of 48 and 18 is 6.\n```",
