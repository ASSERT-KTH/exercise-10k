  "answer": "**Variable Scope Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the concept of variable scope. This example includes a global variable, a local variable, and an enclosed variable.\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = \"I am global\"\n\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Outer function demonstrating variable scope.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Enclosed variable\n    enclosed_variable = \"I am enclosed\"\n\n    def inner_function():\n        \"\"\"\n        Inner function demonstrating variable scope.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Local variable\n        local_variable = \"I am local\"\n        \n        print(\"Inside inner_function():\")\n        print(f\"Global variable: {global_variable}\")\n        print(f\"Enclosed variable: {enclosed_variable}\")\n        print(f\"Local variable: {local_variable}\")\n\n    inner_function()\n\n    # Try to access the local variable\n    try:\n        print(f\"Local variable inside outer_function(): {local_variable}\")\n    except NameError:\n        print(\"Local variable is not accessible here\")\n\n# Call the outer function\nouter_function()\n\n# Try to access the enclosed and local variables\ntry:\n    print(f\"Enclosed variable outside functions: {enclosed_variable}\")\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Enclosed variable is not accessible here\")\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"Local variable outside functions: {local_variable}\")\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Local variable is not accessible here\")\n\nprint(f\"Global variable outside functions: {global_variable}\")\n```\n\n**Output**\n-----------\n\n```\nInside inner_function():\nGlobal variable: I am global\nEnclosed variable: I am enclosed\nLocal variable: I am local\nLocal variable is not accessible here\nEnclosed variable is not accessible here\nLocal variable is not accessible here\nGlobal variable outside functions: I am global\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `global_variable` is accessible from anywhere in the code.\n*   The `enclosed_variable` is accessible within the `outer_function` and its nested functions.\n*   The `local_variable` is only accessible within the `inner_function` where it is defined.\n\nThis example demonstrates the concept of variable scope in Python, where variables are accessible based on their declaration location. The scope of a variable determines its visibility and accessibility throughout the code.",
