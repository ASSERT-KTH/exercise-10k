  "answer": "**Single Number Function**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the single number in an array that appears only once, given that every other number appears twice.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef single_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the single number in an array that appears only once.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The single number that appears only once.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        # XOR operation: a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a\n        result ^= num\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [2, 2, 1]\n    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 1\n\n    nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses the XOR operation to find the single number. The XOR operation has the following properties:\n\n*   `a ^ a = 0` (any number XOR itself is 0)\n*   `a ^ 0 = a` (any number XOR 0 is itself)\n*   `a ^ b ^ a = b` (associative property)\n\nBy XORing all numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving only the single number that appears once.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it only needs to iterate through the array once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.",
