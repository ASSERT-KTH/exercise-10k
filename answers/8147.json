  "answer": "Here's an example of a program that validates an IP address using if/else statements in Python:\n\n```python\ndef validate_ip(ip):\n    # Split the IP address into its four parts\n    parts = ip.split('.')\n\n    # Check if the IP address has four parts\n    if len(parts) != 4:\n        return False\n\n    # Check each part of the IP address\n    for part in parts:\n        # Check if the part is a digit\n        if not part.isdigit():\n            return False\n\n        # Convert the part to an integer\n        num = int(part)\n\n        # Check if the part is within the valid range (0-255)\n        if num < 0 or num > 255:\n            return False\n\n        # Check if the part has a leading zero\n        if len(part) > 1 and part[0] == '0':\n            return False\n\n    # If all checks pass, the IP address is valid\n    return True\n\n\n# Test the function with some examples\nips = ['192.168.1.1', '255.255.255.255', '192.168.1', '192.168.1.256', '192.168.01.1']\n\nfor ip in ips:\n    if validate_ip(ip):\n        print(f'{ip} is a valid IP address.')\n    else:\n        print(f'{ip} is not a valid IP address.')\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `validate_ip` that checks if an IP address is valid. The function splits the IP address into its four parts using the dot (`.`) as a separator, checks if the IP address has four parts, and then checks each part to ensure it's a digit within the valid range (0-255) and doesn't have a leading zero. The function returns `True` if the IP address is valid and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe program then tests the `validate_ip` function with a list of example IP addresses and prints out whether each IP address is valid or not.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Split the IP address**: The IP address is split into its four parts using the dot (`.`) as a separator.\n2. **Check the number of parts**: The IP address must have four parts. If it doesn't, it's not valid.\n3. **Check each part**: Each part must be a digit within the valid range (0-255) and can't have a leading zero.\n4. **Return the result**: If all checks pass, the IP address is valid, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.",
