  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should use a basic algorithm to iterate through the array and find the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef max(a):\n    max_val = a[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        if a[i] > max_val:\n            max_val = a[i]\n    return max_val\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [9, 7, 6, 1, 5, 4, 8, 2, 3]\nprint(max(arr))  # Output: 9\n```\nI've written the code in Python, but I can also provide it in other languages if needed. Let me know!",
