  "prompt": "Write a program that rotates the elements of an array by a specified number of positions. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation is 2, the output should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n```\ndef rotate_array(arr, rotation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate the elements of an array by a specified number of positions.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n        rotation (int): The number of positions to rotate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n    rotation = rotation % len(arr)  # handle cases where rotation > len(arr)\n    return arr[-rotation:] + arr[:-rotation]\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nrotation = 2\nprint(rotate_array(arr, rotation))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n```\nThis program uses Python's list slicing feature to rotate the array. The expression `arr[-rotation:]` gets the last `rotation` elements of the array, and `arr[:-rotation]` gets all elements except the last `rotation` elements. The two slices are then concatenated to form the rotated array.\n\nThe line `rotation = rotation % len(arr)` is used to handle cases where the rotation is greater than the length of the array. This is because rotating an array of length `n` by `n` positions is equivalent to not rotating it at all, and rotating it by `n+1` positions is equivalent to rotating it by 1 position.",
