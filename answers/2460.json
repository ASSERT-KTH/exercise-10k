  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements that are in the first list but not in the second.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [1, 3, 5]\n\ndef difference(a, b):\n    difference = []\n    for i in a:\n        if i not in b:\n            difference.append(i)\n    return difference\n\nprint(difference(a, b))\n```\nThis code defines two lists `a` and `b`, and a function `difference` that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements that are in the first list but not in the second. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the first list, and an `if` statement to check if the element is not in the second list. If the element is not in the second list, it is added to the `difference` list. Finally, the `print` statement is used to print the result of calling the `difference` function with `a` and `b` as arguments.",
