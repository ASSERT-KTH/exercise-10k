  "answer": "**Finding LCM of Two Numbers using GCD**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_lcm(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the LCM of two numbers using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b).\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of a and b using the math.gcd function\n    gcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula\n    lcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    lcm = find_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_lcm` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. It calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the `math.gcd` function.\n3. Then, it calculates the LCM using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`.\n4. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.\n5. In the example usage, we find the LCM of 12 and 15.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave the code in a file named `lcm.py` and run it using Python: `python lcm.py`. The output will be:\n```\nThe LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```",
