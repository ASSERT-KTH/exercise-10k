  "answer": "**Voting Eligibility Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The voting age is set to 18 years old.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age >= 18:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    if check_voting_eligibility(age):\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_voting_eligibility` function takes an `age` parameter and checks if it is greater than or equal to 18.\n2. If the age is 18 or older, the function returns `True`, indicating that the person is eligible to vote.\n3. If the age is less than 18, the function returns `False`, indicating that the person is not eligible to vote.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their age and then calls the `check_voting_eligibility` function with the entered age.\n5. Based on the result of the `check_voting_eligibility` function, the `main` function prints a message indicating whether the person is eligible to vote or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters an age of 25, the program will output: \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* If the user enters an age of 17, the program will output: \"You are not eligible to vote.\"",
