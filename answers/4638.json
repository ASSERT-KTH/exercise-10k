  "answer": "**Cartesian Product Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two lists as input and returns the cartesian product of the two lists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef cartesian_product(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the cartesian product of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The cartesian product of the two lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.product(list1, list2))\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\n    result = cartesian_product(list1, list2)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `cartesian_product` function takes two lists as input and returns their cartesian product.\n*   The `itertools.product` function is used to compute the cartesian product.\n*   The result is converted to a list before being returned.\n*   In the example usage, we define two lists `list1` and `list2`, compute their cartesian product, and print the result.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this program with the example lists, it will output:\n```python\n[(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'c'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\nThis is the cartesian product of the two input lists. Each element in the result is a tuple containing one element from `list1` and one element from `list2`.",
