  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a person's name and age, then prints out a greeting message. If the person is older than 18, the message should include 'Happy Birthday!' otherwise it should include 'You are still young!'",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef greet_person(name, age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a greeting message based on the person's age.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The person's name.\n        age (int): The person's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age > 18:\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}! Happy Birthday!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are still young!\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    # Call the greet_person function\n    greet_person(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `greet_person` function takes two parameters, `name` and `age`, and prints out a greeting message based on the person's age.\n2. **Conditional Statement**: Inside the `greet_person` function, an if-else statement checks if the person is older than 18. If true, it prints a message including 'Happy Birthday!'; otherwise, it prints a message including 'You are still young!'.\n3. **User Input**: In the `main` function, the program uses the built-in `input` function to get the user's name and age.\n4. **Function Call**: The `main` function calls the `greet_person` function with the user-provided name and age.\n5. **Program Entry Point**: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age. After entering the information, it will print out a greeting message based on your age.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 25\nHello, John! Happy Birthday!\n```",
