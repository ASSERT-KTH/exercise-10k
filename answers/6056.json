It has methods to add songs, search for songs by artist, album, or genre, retrieve a song, and display the library.\n\n2. **`__init__` Method**: Initializes the music library with some default songs.\n\n3. **`add_song` Method**: Adds a new song to the library.\n\n4. **`search_by_artist`, `search_by_album`, `search_by_genre` Methods**: These methods search for songs by artist, album, or genre, respectively. They return a list of song names that match the search criteria.\n\n5. **`retrieve_song` Method**: Retrieves a song from the library. If the song is not found, it returns a message indicating that the song is not in the library.\n\n6. **`display_library` Method**: Displays all songs in the library.\n\n7. **`main` Function**: This function provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the music library. It allows users to add songs, search for songs, retrieve a song, display the library, or exit the program.\n\n### Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu.\n3. Follow the prompts to add a song, search for songs",
