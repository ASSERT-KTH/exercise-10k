  "answer": "**Merge Sort Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nMerge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits a list of numbers into smaller sublists, sorts each sublist, and then merges the sorted sublists back together.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the merge sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of numbers to sort.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If the list has 1 or fewer elements, it is already sorted.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Split the list into two halves.\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left = arr[:mid]\n    right = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort each half.\n    left = merge_sort(left)\n    right = merge_sort(right)\n\n    # Merge the sorted halves.\n    return merge(left, right)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        left (list): The first sorted list.\n        right (list): The second sorted list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:\n        if left[0] <= right[0]:\n            result.append(left.pop(0))\n        else:\n            result.append(right.pop(0))\n    result.extend(left)\n    result.extend(right)\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]\n    print(\"Original list:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `merge_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list.\n2. The base case is when the list has 1 or fewer elements, in which case it is already sorted.\n3. The list is split into two halves using the `mid` variable.\n4. Each half is recursively sorted using the `merge_sort` function.\n5. The sorted halves are merged using the `merge` function.\n6. The `merge` function takes two sorted lists as input and returns a single sorted list.\n7. The `merge` function uses a while loop to compare elements from each list and add the smaller element to the result list.\n8. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are appended to the result list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* Best-case: O(n log n)\n* Average-case: O(n log n)\n* Worst-case: O(n log n)\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n* O(n) for the recursive function calls and the temporary lists used during merging.",
