  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and the time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed of an object.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in meters.\n        time (float): The time taken in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Speed Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled (in meters): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken (in seconds): \"))\n\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed of the object is {speed} meters per second.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_speed` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `time`.\n2. It checks if the `time` is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. If the `time` is not zero, it calculates the speed by dividing the `distance` by the `time`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the distance and time.\n5. It calls the `calculate_speed` function with the user-input values and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nSpeed Calculator Program\n------------------------\nEnter the distance traveled (in meters): 100\nEnter the time taken (in seconds): 10\nThe speed of the object is 10.0 meters per second.\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the distance is in meters and the time is in seconds. The speed is calculated in meters per second. If you want to use different units, you can modify the program accordingly.",
