  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD:\n\t* If `b` is 0, the GCD is `a`.\n\t* Otherwise, replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`).\n\t* Repeat this process until `b` is 0.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18: `gcd(48, 18)` returns 6.\n* Calculate the GCD of 12 and 15: `gcd(12, 15)` returns 3.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD.\n* The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n* You can modify the `main` function to accept user input or test the `gcd` function with different examples.",
