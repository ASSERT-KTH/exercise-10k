  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function to remove duplicate characters from a given string, returning the string without duplicates. This solution aims to provide a clear, step-by-step approach to achieve this. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function removes duplicate characters from a given string and returns the resulting string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    input_string (str): The input string from which to remove duplicates.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The input string without duplicates.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty set to keep track of characters we've seen so far\n    seen = set()\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        \n        # Check if the character is not in the seen set\n        if char not in seen:\n            \n            # Add the character to the result string\n            result += char\n            \n            # Add the character to the seen set\n            seen.add(char)\n\n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(remove_duplicates(\"hello\"))  # Output: \"helo\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_duplicates` initializes an empty string `result` to store the output and an empty set `seen` to track characters encountered so far. This allows for efficient lookups of characters to avoid duplicates.\n* It iterates over each character `char` in the `input_string`, checking if `char` is not in the `seen` set. If it's not, the character is added to both the `result` string and the `seen` set.\n* The function returns the `result` string, which contains the input string's characters without duplicates.\n* This approach ensures that the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it efficient for large inputs.",
