  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes in the student's name, score, and attendance percentage, then prints out the grade report. If the score is above 80 and attendance percentage is above 90, print 'Excellent', otherwise print 'Good' or 'Fair'",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score, attendance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on score and attendance.\n\n    Args:\n    score (float): The student's score.\n    attendance (float): The student's attendance percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The grade ('Excellent', 'Good', or 'Fair').\n    \"\"\"\n    if score > 80 and attendance > 90:\n        return 'Excellent'\n    elif score > 70 or attendance > 80:\n        return 'Good'\n    else:\n        return 'Fair'\n\n\ndef print_grade_report(name, score, attendance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the grade report for a student.\n\n    Args:\n    name (str): The student's name.\n    score (float): The student's score.\n    attendance (float): The student's attendance percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    grade = calculate_grade(score, attendance)\n    print(f\"Name: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n    print(f\"Attendance: {attendance}%\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    attendance = float(input(\"Enter the student's attendance percentage: \"))\n\n    print_grade_report(name, score, attendance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes in the score and attendance, then returns the grade based on the given conditions.\n2. The `print_grade_report` function takes in the name, score, and attendance, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints out the grade report.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for input, calls the `print_grade_report` function, and starts the program.\n\n### Example Use Case\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the student's name, score, and attendance percentage. After entering the information, it will print out the grade report.\n\n```\nEnter the student's name: John Doe\nEnter the student's score: 85\nEnter the student's attendance percentage: 95\nName: John Doe\nScore: 85.0\nAttendance: 95.0%\nGrade: Excellent\n```",
