  "answer": "### Merging Dictionaries\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following Python function, `merge_dictionaries`, takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries. If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the built-in dictionary update method to merge the dictionaries\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()  # Create a copy of dict1 to avoid modifying the original\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    dict2 = {\"b\": 3, \"c\": 4}\n    merged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\n    print(merged)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n#### Alternative Solution Using Dictionary Unpacking (Python 3.5+)\n\nYou can also use dictionary unpacking to merge dictionaries in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    dict2 = {\"b\": 3, \"c\": 4}\n    merged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\n    print(merged)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```",
