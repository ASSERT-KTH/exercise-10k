  "answer": "### Asynchronous Operation using Async/Await\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses async/await to perform an asynchronous operation. In this case, we'll simulate a delay of 2 seconds and then return a message.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n# Define an asynchronous function\nasync def perform_async_operation(operation_name: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates an asynchronous operation with a delay.\n    \n    Args:\n    operation_name (str): The name of the operation.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: A success message.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Starting {operation_name}...\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay of 2 seconds\n    print(f\"{operation_name} completed.\")\n    return f\"{operation_name} successful.\"\n\n# Define the main function\nasync def main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the usage of the perform_async_operation function.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    # Perform multiple asynchronous operations concurrently\n    tasks = [\n        perform_async_operation(\"Operation 1\"),\n        perform_async_operation(\"Operation 2\"),\n        perform_async_operation(\"Operation 3\")\n    ]\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n    \n    print(\"Results:\")\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n    \n    print(f\"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define an asynchronous function `perform_async_operation` that takes an `operation_name` as an argument and simulates a delay of 2 seconds using `asyncio.sleep(2)`.\n2. In the `main` function, we create a list of tasks to perform multiple asynchronous operations concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.\n3. We run the `main` function using `asyncio.run(main())`, which starts the event loop and executes the asynchronous operations.\n4. The results of the asynchronous operations are printed to the console, along with the total execution time.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Performing multiple API requests concurrently\n* Handling multiple concurrent database queries\n* Executing multiple tasks in parallel, such as data processing or file I/O operations\n\nNote: This example assumes you have Python 3.7 or later installed, as it uses the `asyncio` library, which is included in the Python standard library.",
