  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is an even number. After printing the even numbers, the program should print out the sum of all the even numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef print_even_numbers():\n    # Initialize sum\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through numbers 1 to 10\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Print the even number\n            print(i)\n            # Add the even number to the sum\n            total_sum += i\n    \n    # Print the sum of all even numbers\n    print(\"Sum of even numbers:\", total_sum)\n\n# Call the function\nprint_even_numbers()\n```\n\nThis program will output:\n```\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nSum of even numbers: 30\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.\n- The `if i % 2 == 0` condition checks if a number is even (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0).\n- If a number is even, it is printed and added to the `total_sum`.\n- After the loop finishes, the `total_sum` is printed out.",
