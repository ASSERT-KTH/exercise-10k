  "prompt": "Create a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes three numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, \n    multiplication, and division operations. It then returns the results of each operation.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        num3 (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the results of each operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results\n    results = {}\n\n    # Perform addition operation\n    results['addition'] = num1 + num2 + num3\n\n    # Perform subtraction operation\n    results['subtraction'] = num1 - num2 - num3\n\n    # Perform multiplication operation\n    results['multiplication'] = num1 * num2 * num3\n\n    # Perform division operation (check for division by zero)\n    if num2 == 0 or num3 == 0:\n        results['division'] = \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n    else:\n        results['division'] = num1 / num2 / num3\n\n    return results\n\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    The main function that takes user input and calls the perform_arithmetic_operations function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Take user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Call the perform_arithmetic_operations function\n    results = perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"\\nResults:\")\n    for operation, result in results.items():\n        print(f\"{operation.capitalize()}: {result}\")\n\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `perform_arithmetic_operations` that takes three numbers as input and performs the required arithmetic operations. The results are stored in a dictionary and returned by the function. The `main` function takes user input, calls the `perform_arithmetic_operations` function, and prints the results.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it, enter the three numbers when prompted, and it will display the results of each operation.",
