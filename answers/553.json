  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the string with all duplicate characters removed.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Remove duplicate characters from a string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    output_string = \"\"\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            output_string += char\n\n    return output_string\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    input_str = \"hello world\"\n    print(\"Input:\", input_str)\n    print(\"Output:\", remove_duplicates(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of characters we have already seen.\n2. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and append it to the output string.\n4. Finally, we return the output string with all duplicate characters removed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating over each character in the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we might need to store all characters in the `seen` set.",
