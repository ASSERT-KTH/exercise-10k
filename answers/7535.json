  "answer": "**Calculating Average Grades for Students**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects, calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, subjects in grades_dict.items():\n        # Initialize sum of grades and count of subjects for the current student\n        total_grade = 0\n        subject_count = 0\n\n        # Iterate over each subject and grade for the current student\n        for subject, grade in subjects.items():\n            # Add the grade to the total and increment the subject count\n            total_grade += grade\n            subject_count += 1\n\n        # Calculate the average grade for the current student\n        if subject_count > 0:\n            average_grade = total_grade / subject_count\n        else:\n            average_grade = 0  # or any other default value if a student has no subjects\n\n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    return average_grades\n\n\n# Example usage\ngrades_dict = {\n    \"John\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 90, \"English\": 78},\n    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 92, \"Science\": 88, \"English\": 95},\n    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 76, \"Science\": 82, \"English\": 89}\n}\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_average_grades` that takes a dictionary `grades_dict` as input.\n2.  Initialize an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n3.  Iterate over each student in the `grades_dict` using a nested loop structure.\n4.  For each student, calculate the sum of their grades and the count of subjects.\n5.  Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the count of subjects.\n6.  Store the average grade in the `average_grades` dictionary.\n7.  Return the `average_grades` dictionary.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```plaintext\n{\n    'John': 84.33333333333333, \n    'Alice': 91.66666666666667, \n    'Bob': 82.33333333333333\n}\n```",
