  "answer": "**University Admission Eligibility Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program determines whether a student is eligible for university admission based on their grades and test scores. The program uses if/else statements to evaluate the student's eligibility.\n\n### Eligibility Criteria\n\n* High school GPA: 3.0 or higher\n* SAT score: 1000 or higher (out of 1600)\n* ACT score: 20 or higher (out of 36)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef determine_eligibility(gpa, sat_score, act_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a student is eligible for university admission.\n    \n    Args:\n        gpa (float): Student's high school GPA\n        sat_score (int): Student's SAT score\n        act_score (int): Student's ACT score\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: Whether the student is eligible for university admission\n    \"\"\"\n    if gpa >= 3.0:\n        # Check SAT score if available\n        if sat_score >= 1000:\n            return True\n        # Check ACT score if available\n        elif act_score >= 20:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    gpa = 3.5\n    sat_score = 1200\n    act_score = 25\n    \n    eligible = determine_eligibility(gpa, sat_score, act_score)\n    \n    if eligible:\n        print(\"The student is eligible for university admission.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The student is not eligible for university admission.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `determine_eligibility` function takes in the student's GPA, SAT score, and ACT score as arguments.\n2. The function first checks if the student's GPA is 3.0 or higher. If it is, the function proceeds to check the SAT score and/or ACT score.\n3. If the SAT score is 1000 or higher, the function returns `True`, indicating that the student is eligible for university admission.\n4. If the SAT score is not available or is below 1000, the function checks the ACT score. If the ACT score is 20 or higher, the function returns `True`.\n5. If neither the SAT score nor the ACT score meets the eligibility criteria, the function returns `False`.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `determine_eligibility` function with example values.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* A student with a GPA of 3.5, SAT score of 1200, and ACT score of 25 would be eligible for university admission.\n* A student with a GPA of 2.5, SAT score of 900, and ACT score of 18 would not be eligible for university admission.\n* A student with a GPA of 3.0, SAT score of 1100, and ACT score of 22 would be eligible for university admission.",
