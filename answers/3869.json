  "prompt": "Given a dictionary with names of months as keys and their corresponding temperatures as values, write a program to sort the dictionary by key and print the sorted dictionary.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_key(temp_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the dictionary by key and prints the sorted dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        temp_dict (dict): A dictionary with names of months as keys and their corresponding temperatures as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the dictionary by key\n    sorted_dict = dict(sorted(temp_dict.items()))\n\n    # Print the sorted dictionary\n    print(\"Sorted Dictionary:\")\n    for key, value in sorted_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n# Example usage\ntemp_dict = {\n    \"July\": 25,\n    \"January\": 10,\n    \"April\": 18,\n    \"October\": 20,\n    \"March\": 15\n}\n\nsort_dict_by_key(temp_dict)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `sorted` function is used to sort the dictionary items (key-value pairs) by key.\n2. The `dict` function is used to convert the sorted list of items back into a dictionary.\n3. The sorted dictionary is then printed out.\n\n**Note:** This solution assumes that the dictionary keys are strings and can be sorted alphabetically. If the keys are not strings, a custom sorting function may be needed.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nSorted Dictionary:\nApril: 18\nJanuary: 10\nJuly: 25\nMarch: 15\nOctober: 20\n```",
