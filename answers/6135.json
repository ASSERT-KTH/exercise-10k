  "prompt": "Ask the user for a word and scramble the letters.",
  "answer": "I'll write a simple Python program to do that. Here it is:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(\"The scrambled word is: \", scrambled_word)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it into a list of characters.\n2. It then uses the `random.shuffle` function to randomly rearrange the characters in the list.\n3. Finally, it uses the `join` function to combine the characters back into a single string.\n4. The `main` function asks the user for a word, scrambles it, and then prints the scrambled word.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a word. For example, if you enter \"hello\", it might output \"lloeh\". The actual scrambled word will be different each time you run the program, because the scrambling is random.",
