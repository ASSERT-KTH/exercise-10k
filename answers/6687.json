  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the remainder of their division.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef get_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the remainder of the division of dividend by divisor.\n    \n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    try:\n        dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n        \n        # Calculate and display the remainder\n        remainder = get_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}.\")\n        \n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n\n*   The program starts by defining a function called `get_remainder` that takes two numbers, `dividend` and `divisor`, as arguments and returns their remainder.\n*   Inside `get_remainder`, we first check if the `divisor` is zero. If it is, we raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.\n*   If the `divisor` is not zero, we calculate the remainder using the modulus operator `%` and return it.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter two numbers, attempt to convert their input to integers, and then call `get_remainder` with these numbers.\n*   We handle potential exceptions, including `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`, to ensure the program does not crash if the user enters invalid input.\n*   Finally, we print out the remainder to the user.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   **Valid Division:** If you enter `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output `The remainder of 17 divided by 5 is 2.`\n*   **Division by Zero:** If you enter `17` as the dividend and `0` as the divisor, the program will output `Cannot divide by zero.`\n*   **Invalid Input:** If you enter something that is not a number, such as `abc`, the program will output `Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.`",
