  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm used in this program is a basic sorting algorithm. It works by sorting the characters in each string and then comparing the sorted strings. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check whether two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in each string\n    sorted_str1 = sorted(str1)\n    sorted_str2 = sorted(str2)\n\n    # Compare the sorted strings\n    return sorted_str1 == sorted_str2\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams of each other.\n2. It removes any whitespace and converts both strings to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It checks if both strings have the same length. If they don't, it immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4. It sorts the characters in each string using the `sorted` function.\n5. It compares the sorted strings. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the original strings are anagrams. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because the `sorted` function has a time complexity of O(n log n) in Python. However, this is sufficient for most use cases, as the length of strings is typically not very large. For very large strings, a more efficient algorithm may be necessary.",
