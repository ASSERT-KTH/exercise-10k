  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Three'. If it is divisible by 5, print 'Five'. If it is divisible by both, print 'ThreeFive'. If it is not divisible by either, print 'None'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    std::cin >> n;\n\n    bool isDivisibleBy3 = n % 3 == 0;\n    bool isDivisibleBy5 = n % 5 == 0;\n\n    if (isDivisibleBy3) {\n        std::cout << \"Three\";\n    }\n\n    if (isDivisibleBy5) {\n        if (isDivisibleBy3) {\n            std::cout << \"Five\";\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Five\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!isDivisibleBy3 && !isDivisibleBy5) {\n        std::cout << \"None\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer `n` from the input, checks its divisibility by 3 and 5, and prints the corresponding output based on the conditions.",
