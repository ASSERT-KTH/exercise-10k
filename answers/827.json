  "answer": "**String Compression**\n=======================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a string, compress it by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count of the number of times it appears.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef compress_string(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compress a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count of the number of times it appears.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The compressed string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    compressed = []\n    count = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            compressed.append(s[i - 1] + str(count))\n            count = 1\n\n    compressed.append(s[-1] + str(count))\n    return \"\".join(compressed)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"AAABBBCCCDDDD\"\n    compressed = compress_string(s)\n    print(f\"Original string: {s}\")\n    print(f\"Compressed string: {compressed}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `compressed` to store the compressed characters and their counts.\n2. Initialize a counter `count` to 1.\n3. Iterate through the input string from the second character to the end.\n4. If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the `count`.\n5. If the current character is different from the previous one, append the previous character and the `count` to the `compressed` list, and reset the `count` to 1.\n6. After the loop, append the last character and the `count` to the `compressed` list.\n7. Join the `compressed` list into a string and return it.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we only iterate through the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because in the worst case, we need to store all characters in the `compressed` list.",
