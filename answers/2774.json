  "answer": "**Text Statistics Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program takes a text as input and prints out statistics about the text, including word count, character count, and the most frequent word.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_text_statistics(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate statistics about the text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the text statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text).lower()\n\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Calculate word count\n    word_count = len(words)\n\n    # Calculate character count\n    character_count = len(text)\n\n    # Calculate most frequent word\n    word_frequencies = Counter(words)\n    most_frequent_word = word_frequencies.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the statistics\n    statistics = {\n        'word_count': word_count,\n        'character_count': character_count,\n        'most_frequent_word': most_frequent_word\n    }\n\n    return statistics\n\ndef print_text_statistics(statistics):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the text statistics.\n\n    Args:\n        statistics (dict): A dictionary containing the text statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Text Statistics:\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    print(f\"Word Count: {statistics['word_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Character Count: {statistics['character_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Most Frequent Word: {statistics['most_frequent_word']}\")\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter a text: \")\n    statistics = calculate_text_statistics(text)\n    print_text_statistics(statistics)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n```bash\nEnter a text: This is a sample text. This text is just a sample.\nText Statistics:\n----------------\nWord Count: 11\nCharacter Count: 46\nMost Frequent Word: this\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The `calculate_text_statistics` function takes a text as input and calculates the word count, character count, and most frequent word.\n2. The `print_text_statistics` function takes a dictionary of statistics as input and prints them out.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a text, calculates the statistics, and prints them out.\n\nNote: This program uses the `re` module to remove punctuation and the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the word frequencies.",
