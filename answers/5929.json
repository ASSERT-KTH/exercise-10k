  "answer": "**Calculating Average Value**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average value of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average value of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average value is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average value.\n2. It first checks if the input list is empty, and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It then calculates the average value by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the length of the list.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save this code to a file (e.g., `average.py`).\n2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python average.py`).\n3. The program will print the average value of the example list.\n4. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
