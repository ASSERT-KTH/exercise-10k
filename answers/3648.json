  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a string and a number as arguments, with a default value of 2 for the number, and returns the string repeated that many times",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef repeat_string(string, n=2):\n    return string * n\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `repeat_string` that takes two arguments, `string` and `n`. The `n` argument has a default value of `2`, which means it's optional and will be set to `2` if not provided. The function returns the result of repeating the `string` `n` times, using the `*` operator.",
