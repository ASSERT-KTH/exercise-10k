  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nHere is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Define the range of numbers\nstart = 1\nend = 11  # End is exclusive, so we use 11 to include 10\n\n# Use a for loop to print the numbers\nfor i in range(start, end):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. We define the range of numbers using the `start` and `end` variables.\n2. We use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers using the `range()` function.\n3. Inside the loop, we print the current number `i`.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\n**Alternative Solution:**\n\nYou can also use a more concise version of the program:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis program achieves the same result as the previous one, but with less code.",
