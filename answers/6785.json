  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer n as input and prints all numbers from n to 1 in reverse order, separated by a space, using a for loop or a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n\n    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {\n        cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer `n` from the standard input, uses a `for` loop to iterate from `n` to 1 in reverse order, and prints each number followed by a space. The loop condition `i >= 1` ensures that the loop continues until `i` is 1, at which point it exits. The `return 0` statement is used to indicate the end of the program.",
