  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. The program should use a basic algorithm to find the maximum number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the provided specifications:\n```\ndef maxNumber(list):\n    maxNum = list[0]\n    for i in list:\n        if i > maxNum:\n            maxNum = i\n    return maxNum\n\nlist = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nprint(maxNumber(list))\n```\nThis code defines a function `maxNumber` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. It initializes `maxNum` to the first element of the list and then iterates over the list, updating `maxNum` whenever it encounters a larger number. Finally, it returns `maxNum`. The code also tests the function with a sample list and prints the result.",
