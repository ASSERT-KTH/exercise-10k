  "answer": "**Loan Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_monthly_payment(loan_amount, interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly payment for a loan.\n\n    Args:\n        loan_amount (float): The total amount borrowed.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        years (int): The number of years to repay the loan.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n    number_of_payments = years * 12\n    monthly_payment = loan_amount * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments / ((1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments - 1)\n    return round(monthly_payment, 2)\n\ndef main():\n    loan_amount = float(input(\"Enter the loan amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    monthly_payment = calculate_monthly_payment(loan_amount, interest_rate, years)\n    print(f\"The monthly payment is: ${monthly_payment}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_monthly_payment` function takes in the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years as arguments.\n2. It calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.\n3. It calculates the number of payments by multiplying the number of years by 12.\n4. It uses the formula for monthly payments on a fixed-rate loan to calculate the monthly payment amount.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to input the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years, and then calls the `calculate_monthly_payment` function to calculate and display the monthly payment.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Loan amount: $10,000\n* Interest rate: 6%\n* Number of years: 5\n\nRunning the program with these inputs will output:\n\n```\nThe monthly payment is: $193.79\n```",
