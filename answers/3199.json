  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a person's age as input and uses if/else statements to determine their age group (e.g., child, adult, senior).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef determine_age_group(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the age group of a person based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The age group of the person.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age < 0:\n        return \"Invalid age. Age cannot be negative.\"\n    elif age < 18:\n        return \"Child\"\n    elif age < 65:\n        return \"Adult\"\n    else:\n        return \"Senior\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the person's age from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    # Determine the age group\n    age_group = determine_age_group(age)\n\n    # Print the age group\n    print(f\"Your age group is: {age_group}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `determine_age_group` function takes an `age` as input and uses if/else statements to determine the age group.\n2. If the age is less than 0, it returns an error message.\n3. If the age is less than 18, it returns \"Child\".\n4. If the age is less than 65, it returns \"Adult\".\n5. Otherwise, it returns \"Senior\".\n6. The `main` function gets the person's age from the user, determines the age group using the `determine_age_group` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters 10, the program will output \"Your age group is: Child\".\n* If the user enters 25, the program will output \"Your age group is: Adult\".\n* If the user enters 70, the program will output \"Your age group is: Senior\".",
