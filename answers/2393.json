  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in C++:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, r;\n\n    cout << \"Enter first number: \";\n    cin >> a;\n\n    cout << \"Enter second number: \";\n    cin >> b;\n\n    while (b != 0) {\n        r = a % b;\n        a = b;\n        b = r;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"GCD: \" << a << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified:\n\n1. It includes the `iostream` header file.\n2. It uses the `using namespace std;` directive to avoid prefixing standard library elements with `std::`.\n3. It declares the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.\n4. It declares three integer variables: `a`, `b`, and `r`.\n5. It prompts the user to input two numbers using `cout` statements.\n6. It reads the user's input into `a` and `b` using `cin` statements.\n7. It uses a `while` loop to calculate the GCD of `a` and `b`. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder `r` of `a` divided by `b` using the modulo operator (`a % b`), assigns the value of `b` to `a`, and assigns the value of `r` to `b`. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0.\n8. It outputs the calculated GCD using `cout`.\n9. It returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.\n\nThis code implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers, as described in the specification.",
