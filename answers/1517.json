  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Program**\n===========================================================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nThis program finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use a sliding window approach with a set to store unique characters in the current window.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    left = 0  # Left pointer of the sliding window\n    max_length = 0  # Maximum length of substring without repeating characters\n    max_substring = \"\"  # Longest substring without repeating characters\n    char_set = set()  # Set to store unique characters in the current window\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        # Move the right pointer to the right\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            # If the character is in the set, remove the leftmost character\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n\n        char_set.add(s[right])  # Add the current character to the set\n\n        # Update the maximum length and substring if necessary\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"abcabcbb\"\n    longest_substring = longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(input_string)\n    print(f\"Longest substring without repeating characters: {longest_substring}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.\n2. Use a set, `char_set`, to store unique characters in the current window.\n3. Iterate over the string with the `right` pointer.\n4. If a repeating character is found, move the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the set.\n5. Update the maximum length and substring if a longer substring without repeating characters is found.\n6. Return the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we are iterating over the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, since we are storing unique characters in the set. In the worst case, the set will store all unique characters in the string, which is min(n, m).",
