  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the list, and then prints the element at the middle index of the reversed list. If the list has an even number of elements, print the average of the two middle elements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that matches the provided specification:\n```\n# Description: This program takes a list of integers as input, reverses the list, and prints the middle element (or average of the two middle elements if the list has an even number of elements).\n\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    input_list = input(\"Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: \")\n\n    # Parse input\n    try:\n        input_list = list(map(int, input_list.split()))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a list of integers separated by spaces.\")\n        return\n\n    # Reverse the list\n    input_list = input_list[::-1]\n\n    # Find the middle index\n    middle_index = len(input_list) // 2\n\n    # Print the middle element\n    if len(input_list) % 2 != 0:\n        print(input_list[middle_index])\n    else:\n        print((input_list[middle_index - 1] + input_list[middle_index]) / 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they are not relevant to the functionality of the code. You can fill them in as needed.",
