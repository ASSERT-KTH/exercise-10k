  "answer": "### Number Guessing Game Function\n\nHere's a Python function that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.\n    Provides hints after each guess.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I'll reveal the number. It was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### How the Function Works\n\n1. **Generate a Random Number**: The function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. **Initialize the Number of Attempts**: The function initializes a counter to keep track of the number of attempts the user makes.\n3. **Ask the User for Their Guess**: The function asks the user to guess the number using `input(\"Take a guess: \")`.\n4. **Check the User's Guess**: The function checks if the user's guess is:\n\t* A valid integer.\n\t* Within the correct range (1-100).\n\t* Equal to the number to guess.\n\t* Higher or lower than the number to guess.\n5. **Provide Hints**: If the user's guess is not correct, the function provides hints to help them guess again.\n6. **Repeat Until Correct**: The function repeats steps 3-5 until the user guesses the correct number or decides to quit.",
