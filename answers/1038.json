  "answer": "**Coin Change Problem**\n=======================\n\nThe coin change problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming that involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a Python solution using dynamic programming:\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        coins (list): A list of coin denominations.\n        amount (int): The amount to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed. Returns -1 if it's not possible to make change.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make 0 amount\n\n    # Fill the table using dynamic programming\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If it's not possible to make change, return -1\n    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return dp[amount]\n\n# Example usage\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)\n```\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThe solution uses a dynamic programming approach to build a table `dp` that stores the minimum number of coins needed to make change for each amount from 0 to `amount`.\n\n1. Initialize the table with infinity values, except for the base case `dp[0] = 0`.\n2. Iterate through each coin denomination and update the table as follows:\n\t* For each amount `i` that is greater than or equal to the coin denomination, update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`.\n3. If it's not possible to make change for the given amount, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum number of coins needed.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where `amount` is the given amount and `len(coins)` is the number of coin denominations.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(amount), as we need to store the table `dp` of size `amount + 1`.",
