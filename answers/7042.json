  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a name as input and prints out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message for the given name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Gets a name from the user and prints out a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print_greeting(name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_greeting` function takes a `name` as input and prints out a greeting message using an f-string.\n2. The `main` function gets a `name` from the user using the built-in `input` function, and then calls `print_greeting` with the entered `name`.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John!\n```",
