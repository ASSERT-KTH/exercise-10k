  "prompt": "Write a program that searches for a specific element in a given array and returns its index if found.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\ndef find_element(arr, target):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 3\nresult = find_element(arr, target)\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\nThis code defines the `find_element` function, which iterates through the array using a `for` loop and checks each element against the target element. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the element. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the element was not found.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `find_element` function with an array and a target element, and how to handle the return value to print a message indicating whether the element was found or not.",
