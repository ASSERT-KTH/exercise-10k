  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements from the first array paired with the corresponding elements from the second array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int ar1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    int ar2[] = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n\n    int n = sizeof(ar1) / sizeof(ar1[0]);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cout << \"(\" << ar1[i] << \", \" << ar2[i] << \")\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code defines two integer arrays `ar1` and `ar2`, calculates the number of elements in `ar1` using the `sizeof` operator, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of `ar1` and `ar2`. Inside the loop, it prints each pair of elements in the format `(ar1[i], ar2[i])`. The program returns 0 at the end.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the two arrays have the same number of elements. If the arrays have different lengths, the code will not work correctly.",
