  "answer": "**Dictionary Difference Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following function calculates the difference between two dictionaries. It returns a dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are present in the first dictionary but not in the second, or have different values.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are present in dict1 but not in dict2, or have different values.\n    \"\"\"\n    diff = {}\n    for key in dict1:\n        if key not in dict2 or dict1[key] != dict2[key]:\n            diff[key] = dict1[key]\n    return diff\n\ndef dict_diff_both_ways(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are present in either dict1 or dict2 but not both, or have different values.\n    \"\"\"\n    diff1 = dict_diff(dict1, dict2)\n    diff2 = dict_diff(dict2, dict1)\n    return {**diff1, **diff2}\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n    dict2 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 3, \"d\": 4}\n\n    print(\"Difference from dict1 to dict2:\")\n    print(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n\n    print(\"Symmetric difference:\")\n    print(dict_diff_both_ways(dict1, dict2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `dict_diff` function iterates over the key-value pairs in the first dictionary.\n*   For each key, it checks if the key is not present in the second dictionary or if the values are different.\n*   If either condition is true, it adds the key-value pair to the `diff` dictionary.\n*   The `dict_diff_both_ways` function calculates the symmetric difference by calling `dict_diff` twice, once in each direction, and combining the results.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nDifference from dict1 to dict2:\n{'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nSymmetric difference:\n{'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n```",
