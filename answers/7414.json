  "prompt": "Create a program that stores student grades in a dictionary. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and a grade, then add the grade to the student's list of grades in the dictionary. If the student is not already in the dictionary, the program should add them with the given grade as their first grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades\nstudent_grades = {}\n\ndef add_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prompts the user to input a student's name and a grade, \n    then adds the grade to the student's list of grades in the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Prompt the user to input a student's name\n    student_name = input(\"Please enter the student's name: \")\n\n    # Prompt the user to input a grade\n    while True:\n        try:\n            grade = float(input(\"Please enter the student's grade: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Check if the student is already in the dictionary\n    if student_name in student_grades:\n        # If the student is already in the dictionary, append the grade to their list of grades\n        student_grades[student_name].append(grade)\n    else:\n        # If the student is not in the dictionary, add them with the given grade as their first grade\n        student_grades[student_name] = [grade]\n\n    # Print a confirmation message\n    print(f\"Grade added for {student_name}.\")\n\ndef print_grades():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out the grades for all students in the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the dictionary is empty\n    if not student_grades:\n        print(\"No grades have been entered.\")\n    else:\n        # Print out the grades for all students\n        for student, grades in student_grades.items():\n            print(f\"{student}: {grades}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Run the program in a loop until the user chooses to quit\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Add a grade\")\n        print(\"2. Print all grades\")\n        print(\"3. Quit\")\n        \n        # Prompt the user to choose an option\n        choice = input(\"Please choose an option: \")\n        \n        # Handle the user's choice\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            add_grade()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            print_grades()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `student_grades` dictionary stores student names as keys and lists of grades as values.\n*   The `add_grade` function prompts the user to input a student's name and a grade, then adds the grade to the student's list of grades in the dictionary. If the student is not already in the dictionary, it adds them with the given grade as their first grade.\n*   The `print_grades` function prints out the grades for all students in the dictionary.\n*   The `main` function runs the program in a loop until the user chooses to quit, prompting the user to choose an option and handling their choice accordingly.",
