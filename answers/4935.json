  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The program should use the formula volume = side_length ** 3 to calculate the volume.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on your specifications:\n```\ndef cube_volume():\n    s = float(input(\"Enter side length of cube: \"))\n    volume = s ** 3\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f}\")\n\ncube_volume()\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
