  "prompt": "Write a program to search for a specific element in an array.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that searches for a specific element in an array:\n\n```python\ndef search_element(array, target):\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] == target:\n            return f\"Element {target} found at index {i}\"\n    return f\"Element {target} not found in the array\"\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 3\nprint(search_element(array, target))\n\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 6\nprint(search_element(array, target))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function `search_element` that takes two parameters: `array` and `target`.\n2. **Loop through the array**: We loop through the array using a for loop, checking each element to see if it matches the target.\n3. **Return the result**: If we find the target, we return a message indicating that the element was found, along with its index. If we don't find the target, we return a message indicating that the element was not found.\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are potentially checking every element in the array once.\n\n### Advice:\nThis program is a simple example and may not be suitable for large arrays or performance-critical applications. In such cases, more efficient algorithms like binary search (which has a time complexity of O(log n)) may be more suitable. However, binary search requires the array to be sorted, which may not always be the case.",
