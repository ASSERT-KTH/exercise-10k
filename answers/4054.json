  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a dictionary and a filter condition as input and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet the filter condition.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters a dictionary based on a given condition, helping you understand the process and implementation. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef filter_dict(input_dict, filter_condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters a dictionary based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be filtered.\n        filter_condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns True if the pair meets the condition, False otherwise.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet the filter condition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered key-value pairs\n    filtered_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        \n        # Check if the current key-value pair meets the filter condition\n        if filter_condition(key, value):\n            \n            # If the condition is met, add the key-value pair to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_dict\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a filter condition function\ndef condition(key, value):\n    return value > 10\n\n# Create a sample dictionary\nsample_dict = {'a': 5, 'b': 15, 'c': 20, 'd': 8}\n\n# Use the filter_dict function\nfiltered_sample = filter_dict(sample_dict, condition)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(filtered_sample)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `filter_dict` takes two parameters: `input_dict` (the dictionary to be filtered) and `filter_condition` (a function that defines the filtering criteria). It initializes an empty dictionary `filtered_dict` to store the filtered key-value pairs.\n* It iterates over each key-value pair in `input_dict` using a for loop, checking if the current pair meets the `filter_condition` by calling the `filter_condition` function with the key and value as arguments.\n* If the condition is met, it adds the key-value pair to `filtered_dict`. Finally, it returns `filtered_dict`, which contains only the key-value pairs that satisfy the filter condition.\n* To use this function, you need to define a filter condition function (like the `condition` function in the example) and pass it along with the dictionary you want to filter to the `filter_dict` function.",
