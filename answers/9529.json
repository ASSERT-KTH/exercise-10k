  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their grades as values, but only if the grade is above 85. The function should also calculate the average grade of all the students who passed (i.e., grade above 85) and return it as a separate value.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that filters students with high grades and calculates their average grade. This function will take a dictionary of student names and grades as input and return a new dictionary with students who passed, along with their average grade. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_students(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters a dictionary of student names and grades, \n    returning a new dictionary with only the students who have a grade above 85.\n    It also calculates and returns the average grade of these students.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing a dictionary of passed students and their average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the students who passed\n    passed_students = {}\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the grades of the passed students\n    passed_grades = []\n\n    # Iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():\n        # Check if the grade is above 85\n        if grade > 85:\n            # If the grade is above 85, add the student to the passed_students dictionary\n            passed_students[student] = grade\n            # Also add the grade to the passed_grades list\n            passed_grades.append(grade)\n\n    # Calculate the average grade of the passed students\n    # Check if there are any passed students to avoid division by zero error\n    if passed_grades:\n        # If there are passed students, calculate the average grade\n        average_grade = sum(passed_grades) / len(passed_grades)\n    else:\n        # If there are no passed students, set the average grade to None\n        average_grade = None\n\n    # Return the dictionary of passed students and their average grade\n    return passed_students, average_grade\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"John\": 90,\n    \"Alice\": 80,\n    \"Bob\": 95,\n    \"Charlie\": 70\n}\n\npassed, average = filter_students(grades)\nprint(\"Passed Students:\", passed)\nprint(\"Average Grade:\", average)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `filter_students` initializes two empty variables: `passed_students` (a dictionary) to store students who passed and `passed_grades` (a list) to store their grades.\n*   It iterates over the input dictionary `grades_dict`, checks each student's grade, and adds them to `passed_students` and `passed_grades` if their grade is above 85.\n*   After iterating over all students, it calculates the average grade of the passed students by summing up all grades in `passed_grades` and dividing by the number of grades, handling the case where no students passed to avoid division by zero.\n*   Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `passed_students` dictionary and the calculated `average_grade`.",
