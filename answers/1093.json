  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and the amount of fuel used.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.\n        fuel (float): The amount of fuel used in gallons.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Fuel used must be greater than zero.\")\n    if distance < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Distance traveled cannot be negative.\")\n\n    fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel\n    return fuel_efficiency\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    fuel = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel used in gallons: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and display the fuel efficiency\n        fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel)\n        print(f\"The fuel efficiency is {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `fuel`.\n2. It checks if the fuel used is greater than zero and if the distance traveled is not negative. If either condition is not met, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the fuel efficiency by dividing the distance traveled by the amount of fuel used.\n4. The `main` function gets the user input for distance and fuel, calculates the fuel efficiency using the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function, and displays the result.\n5. The program handles potential errors by catching `ValueError` exceptions and displaying the error message.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the distance traveled in miles: 250\nEnter the amount of fuel used in gallons: 10\nThe fuel efficiency is 25.00 miles per gallon.\n```",
