  "prompt": "Create a function to analyze data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary will contain student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function to analyze student grades stored in a dictionary and calculate the average grade for each student. This function will return a new dictionary with student names as keys and their average grades as values. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Check if the grades are stored in a list or dictionary\n        if isinstance(grades, dict):\n            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student\n            total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n            \n            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of subjects\n            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n        elif isinstance(grades, list):\n            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student\n            total_grade = sum(grades)\n            \n            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of grades\n            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n        else:\n            # If the grades are not stored in a list or dictionary, assume it's a single grade\n            average_grade = grades\n\n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades for each student\n    return average_grades\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades_dict = {\n    'John': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},\n    'Alice': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 92},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 75, 'English': 85}\n}\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average_grades` initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n* It iterates over each student in the input dictionary `grades_dict`, calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of subjects or grades, and stores the result in the `average_grades` dictionary.\n* The function handles different data structures for grades (lists, dictionaries, or single values) by using `isinstance` checks and adjusting the calculation accordingly.\n* Finally, it returns the `average_grades` dictionary containing the average grades for each student.",
