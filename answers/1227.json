  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a while loop to calculate and print the first n Fibonacci numbers:\n\n```python\ndef print_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the current Fibonacci number\n    i = 0\n\n    # Use a while loop to calculate and print the first n Fibonacci numbers\n    while i < n:\n        # Print the current Fibonacci number\n        print(a)\n\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n        # Increment the counter\n        i += 1\n\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"First {n} Fibonacci numbers:\")\nprint_fibonacci(n)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `print_fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. We use a while loop to iterate `n` times, and in each iteration, we print the current Fibonacci number and calculate the next one using the recurrence relation `a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2)`.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, so we initialize `a` and `b` to these values. We also initialize a counter `i` to keep track of the current Fibonacci number.\n\nIn each iteration of the while loop, we print the current Fibonacci number `a`, calculate the next one by updating `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b`, respectively, and increment the counter `i`.\n\nFinally, we provide an example usage of the `print_fibonacci` function by calling it with `n = 10` and printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output the following:\n```\nFirst 10 Fibonacci numbers:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n34\n```",
