  "answer": "**Filtering Numbers Above a Threshold**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python function that filters a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the numbers above a given threshold:\n\n```python\ndef filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list of numbers and return a new list with only the numbers above a given threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n        threshold (float): The threshold value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with only the numbers above the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if num > threshold]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nthreshold = 3\nresult = filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold)\nprint(result)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list with only the numbers that are greater than the threshold. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list if it meets the condition.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n---------------------------\n\nIf you prefer a more traditional approach, you can use a for loop to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold):\n    result = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > threshold:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nBoth implementations have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, making them suitable for large datasets.",
