  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing the same integers in sorted order.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that sorts a list of integers using the built-in `sorted` function:\n\n```python\ndef sort_integers(integers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        integers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the same integers in sorted order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(integers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = sort_integers(numbers)\nprint(sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how this program works:\n\n1. The `sort_integers` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of integers in ascending order.\n3. The sorted list is returned by the `sort_integers` function.\n4. In the example usage, we create a list of integers called `numbers`.\n5. We call the `sort_integers` function with `numbers` as the input, and store the result in the `sorted_numbers` variable.\n6. Finally, we print the sorted list of integers.\n\nNote that this program uses the built-in `sorted` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average. This makes it efficient for sorting large lists of integers.",
