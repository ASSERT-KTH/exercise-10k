  "answer": "**Math Operation Function**\n==========================\n\nHere's a Python function that performs basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator.\n\n```python\ndef math_operation(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a basic arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operator (str): The arithmetic operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the operator is not supported.\n    ZeroDivisionError: If division by zero is attempted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        '/': lambda x, y: x / y\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operator is supported\n    if operator not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported operator: {operator}\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    try:\n        result = operations[operator](num1, num2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\n```\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The function supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n* It raises a `ValueError` if an unsupported operator is provided.\n* It raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if division by zero is attempted.\n* The function uses a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding lambda functions, making it easy to add or remove supported operators.",
