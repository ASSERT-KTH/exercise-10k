  "prompt": "Write a program to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user, asking for their choice and generating a random choice for the computer",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Ask for the user's choice.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return user_choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors.\"\"\"\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer.\n2. The `get_user_choice` function asks for the user's choice and validates it to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n3. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\n4. The `play_game` function orchestrates the game, getting the user's and computer's choices, and determining the winner.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (e.g., \"rock\").\n3. The program will generate a random choice for the computer and display both choices.\n4. The program will determine the winner and display the result.",
