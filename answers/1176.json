  "answer": "**Checking if a String is a Rotation of Another**\n======================================================\n\nA string is considered a rotation of another if it can be obtained by rotating the characters of the original string. For example, \"abcde\" is a rotation of \"cdeab\".\n\n**Algorithm**\n------------\n\nTo check if a string is a rotation of another, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Concatenate the first string with itself.\n2. Check if the second string is a substring of the concatenated string.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the algorithm:\n```python\ndef is_rotation(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if s2 is a rotation of s1.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The original string.\n        s2 (str): The string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s2 is a rotation of s1, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    return s2 in s1 + s1\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"abcde\"\ns2 = \"cdeab\"\nprint(is_rotation(s1, s2))  # Output: True\n\ns1 = \"abcde\"\ns2 = \"abecd\"\nprint(is_rotation(s1, s2))  # Output: False\n```\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\nThe `is_rotation` function takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input. It first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`, since a string cannot be a rotation of another string with a different length.\n\nIf the lengths are equal, it concatenates `s1` with itself using the `+` operator. It then checks if `s2` is a substring of the concatenated string using the `in` operator. If `s2` is a substring, it means that `s2` is a rotation of `s1`, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n----------------\n\nThe time complexity of the `is_rotation` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `in` operator has a time complexity of O(n) in Python.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n----------------\n\nThe space complexity of the `is_rotation` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the function creates a new string by concatenating `s1` with itself, which requires additional memory.",
