  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Return the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get and validate the user's choice.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `get_user_choice` function gets and validates the user's choice.\n3. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n4. The `play_game` function plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors by getting the user's and computer's choices and determining the winner.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to make the computer's choice. In a real-world application, you might want to use a more secure random number generator.",
