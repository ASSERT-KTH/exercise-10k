  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns another function with access to its own scope, addressing your question with a practical example and explanation. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining a function that will return another function.\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns another function with access to its own scope.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that has access to its own scope.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We define a variable in the outer function's scope.\n    # This variable will be accessible to the inner function.\n    outer_variable = \"I'm in the outer scope\"\n\n    # We define an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.\n    def inner_function():\n        # The inner function can print the outer variable.\n        print(outer_variable)\n\n    # The outer function returns the inner function.\n    return inner_function\n\n# We call the outer function to get the inner function.\ninner_func = outer_function()\n\n# We call the inner function to test its access to the outer scope.\ninner_func()  # Outputs: I'm in the outer scope\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `outer_function` is defined to return another function (`inner_function`), allowing the inner function to have access to the outer function's scope.\n*   A variable `outer_variable` is defined within the `outer_function`'s scope, demonstrating how it can be accessed by the `inner_function`.\n*   The `inner_function` is returned by the `outer_function` and can be called independently, showcasing its ability to print the `outer_variable` from the outer scope.\n*   By calling the `outer_function` and storing its result in `inner_func`, we can then invoke `inner_func` to verify that it correctly accesses and prints the `outer_variable`.",
