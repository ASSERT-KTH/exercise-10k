  "answer": "**Student Score Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes in a student's score and checks if they passed or failed using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef check_score(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student passed or failed based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating whether the student passed or failed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 60:\n        return \"Passed\"\n    else:\n        return \"Failed\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (out of 100): \"))\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Check if the student passed or failed\n        result = check_score(score)\n        print(f\"The student {result} with a score of {score}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the student's score is 80, the program will output: \"The student Passed with a score of 80.\"\n* If the student's score is 40, the program will output: \"The student Failed with a score of 40.\"\n* If the student's score is 150, the program will output: \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\"\n\n### How to Run\n\n1. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `student_score_checker.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python student_score_checker.py`.\n4. Enter the student's score when prompted.\n\nNote: This program assumes that a score of 60 or above is a passing score. You can adjust the threshold value in the `check_score` function to change this.",
