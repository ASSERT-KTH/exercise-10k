  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all possible combinations of elements from both lists.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfrom itertools import product\n\nl1 = [1, 2, 3]\nl2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\n# Method 1: Using product function\nresult1 = [list(i) for i in product(l1, l2)]\nprint(result1)\n\n# Method 2: Using nested loops\nresult2 = []\nfor i in l1:\n    for j in l2:\n        result2.append([i, j])\nprint(result2)\n```\nThis code defines two lists `l1` and `l2`, and then uses the `product` function from the `itertools` module to generate the Cartesian product of the two lists. It also uses nested loops to achieve the same result. The resulting lists of pairs are printed to the console.",
