  "prompt": "Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice and determine the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_game():\n    # Define the possible choices\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n\n    # Generate a random choice for the computer\n    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n    # Ask the user for their choice\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \")\n\n    # Validate the user's choice\n    while user_choice.lower() not in choices:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \")\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    print(f\"User chose: {user_choice}\\n\")\n\n    if computer_choice == user_choice:\n        print(f\"It's a tie! Both chose {user_choice}.\")\n    elif (computer_choice == 'rock' and user_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (computer_choice == 'paper' and user_choice == 'rock') or \\\n         (computer_choice == 'scissors' and user_choice == 'paper'):\n        print(f\"Computer wins! {computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"User wins! {user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter y or n: \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `play_game` function generates a random choice for the computer and asks the user for their choice. The function then determines the winner based on the game's rules and prints out the result. The `main` function runs the game in a loop until the user decides to stop playing.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`).",
