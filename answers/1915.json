  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the variance of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return variance\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Variance: {variance}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count.\n2. The `calculate_variance` function calculates the variance of a list of numbers by finding the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n3. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers by taking the square root of the variance.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use these functions with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save this code to a file (e.g., `std_dev.py`).\n2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python std_dev.py`).\n3. The program will print the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the example list of numbers.\n\nNote: This implementation uses a population standard deviation formula, which divides by `n` (the number of data points). If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation, you should divide by `n-1` instead.",
