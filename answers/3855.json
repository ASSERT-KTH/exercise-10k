It iterates over each cell in the board, and if the cell is empty (i.e., has a value of 0), it tries to place a number from 1 to 9 in that cell. If the number is valid (i.e., does not conflict with any other numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box), it recursively calls the `solve_sudoku` function to fill in the rest of the board. If the recursive call returns `True`, it means that the puzzle has been solved, and the function returns `True`. If the recursive call returns `False`, it means that the current number cannot be placed in the current cell, so the function backtracks and tries the next number.\n\n",
