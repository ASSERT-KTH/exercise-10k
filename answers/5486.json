The `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function takes two arguments, `start` and `end`, which represent the range of numbers to search for prime numbers.\n2. The function creates a boolean array, `prime`, of size `end+1`, where `prime[i]` represents whether `i` is a prime number or not.\n3. The function iterates from 2 to the square root of `end`, and for each prime `p` in this range, it marks as composite all the multiples of `p` by setting `prime[i]` to `False` for `i` ranging from `p*p` to `end+1` in increments of `p`.\n4. The function returns a list of all prime numbers in the range by iterating over the `prime` array and returning the indices of the `True` values.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the start and end of the range, calls the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function, and prints the list of prime numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the start of the range: 10\nEnter the end of the range: 50\nPrime numbers in the range: [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]\n```\n\nNote: This program has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large ranges.",
