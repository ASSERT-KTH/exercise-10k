  "answer": "**Least Frequent Character Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the least frequent character in a given string. If there are multiple characters with the same minimum frequency, it returns all of them.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef least_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the least frequent character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of the least frequent characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n    \n    # Find the minimum frequency\n    min_freq = min(char_count.values())\n    \n    # Find all characters with the minimum frequency\n    least_frequent = [char for char, freq in char_count.items() if freq == min_freq]\n    \n    return least_frequent\n\n# Example usage\nprint(least_frequent_char(\"Hello World\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `least_frequent_char` takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It removes whitespace from the string and converts it to lowercase to ensure the function is case-insensitive.\n3. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.\n4. It finds the minimum frequency by using the `min` function on the values of the `char_count` dictionary.\n5. It uses a list comprehension to find all characters with the minimum frequency.\n6. Finally, it returns a list of the least frequent characters.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function returns all characters with the minimum frequency. If you want to return only one character, you can modify the function to return the first character it encounters with the minimum frequency.",
