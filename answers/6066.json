  "prompt": "Create a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should use a while loop to keep playing until the user chooses to quit.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'user'\n    else:\n        return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'quit':\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        elif user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.\")\n            continue\n\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(\"You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins!\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. The program uses a `while` loop to continuously play the game until the user chooses to quit.\n2. The user is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit).\n3. If the user enters 'quit', the game ends.\n4. If the user enters an invalid choice, they are asked to enter a valid choice.\n5. The computer's choice is randomly selected from a list of possible choices.\n6. The winner is determined based on the user's and computer's choices.\n7. The result of the game is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Run the program and enter 'rock' when prompted. The computer will select a random choice and the winner will be determined.\n* Run the program and enter 'quit' when prompted. The game will end and a message will be printed to the console.\n* Run the program and enter an invalid choice (e.g. 'hello'). The program will ask for a valid choice.",
