  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a set of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the median of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    numbers.sort()\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        median = (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2\n    else:\n        median = numbers[n//2]\n    return median\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers, mean):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [float(x) for x in input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \").split()]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers, mean)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count.\n2. The `calculate_median` function calculates the median of a list of numbers by sorting the list and finding the middle value(s).\n3. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers by finding the square root of the variance.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input a list of numbers, calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation, and prints the results.\n\n### Example Use Case\n```\nEnter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5\nMean: 3.0\nMedian: 3\nStandard Deviation: 1.5811388300841898\n```\n\nNote: This program uses a population standard deviation formula. If you need to calculate the sample standard deviation, replace `len(numbers)` with `len(numbers) - 1` in the `calculate_standard_deviation` function.",
