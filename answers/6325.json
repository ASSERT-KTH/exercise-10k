  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and an element as input, removes all occurrences of the element from the array, and returns the resulting array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef removeElement(array, element):\n    # array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    # element = 2\n    # array = [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    while element in array:\n        array.remove(element)\n    return array\n```\nThis code defines a function `removeElement` that takes two parameters: `array` and `element`. The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly remove the `element` from the `array` until it is no longer present. The modified `array` is then returned.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `remove` method of the list, which removes the first occurrence of the `element`. Since the `while` loop continues until the `element` is no longer in the `array`, all occurrences of the `element` will be removed.\n\nYou can test this function with the example input provided in the specification:\n```\narray = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nelement = 2\nresult = removeElement(array, element)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```",
