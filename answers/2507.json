  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and returns the result of the first number multiplied by the second, then added to the third.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that achieves the described functionality:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_result(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes three numbers as input, multiplies the first two numbers, \n    and then adds the third number to the result.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The first number.\n        b (float): The second number.\n        c (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b + c\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    result = calculate_result(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_result` that takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n2. Inside the function, we calculate the result by multiplying `a` and `b`, then adding `c` to the product.\n3. We return the calculated result.\n4. In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we ask the user to input three numbers.\n5. We call the `calculate_result` function with the user's input and store the result in the `result` variable.\n6. Finally, we print the result to the console.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `calculator.py`) and run it from the command line using `python calculator.py`. Follow the prompts to input the three numbers, and the program will display the calculated result.",
