  "answer": "**Hangman Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a while loop to play a game of Hangman. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to guess from\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    word_length = len(word)\n\n    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores\n    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length\n    guessed_letters = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(display_hangman(tries))\n    print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n\n    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) != 1:\n            print(\"Please, guess one letter at a time.\")\n        elif guess in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You already guessed the letter\", guess)\n        elif guess not in word:\n            print(guess, \"is not in the word.\")\n            tries -= 1\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Good job!\", guess, \"is in the word!\")\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            word_as_list = list(word)\n            indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n            for index in indices:\n                guessed_word[index] = guess\n\n        print(display_hangman(tries))\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n\n    if '_' not in guessed_word:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you didn't guess the word.

Run the program.\n2. The program will display a word with underscores representing each letter.\n3. Guess a letter by typing it in.\n4. If the letter is in the word, the program will fill in the corresponding underscores.\n5. If the letter is not in the word, the program will draw a part of a hangman's gallows.\n6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or the gallows is complete and the hangman is hanged.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simple list of words to guess from. You can add more words to the list to make the game more challenging.",
