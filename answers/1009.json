  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n====================================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a set to keep track of unique characters and then constructs the resulting string.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate characters from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"hello world\"\n    print(\"Input String:\", input_str)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_str))\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. Initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of unique characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the characters without duplicates.\n3. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n4. For each character, check if it's already in the `seen` set. If not, add it to the set and append it to the `result` list.\n5. Finally, join the characters in the `result` list into a string using `''.join(result)`.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we're doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst-case scenario (when all characters are unique), the size of the `seen` set and the `result` list will be equal to the length of the input string.",
