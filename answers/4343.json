  "prompt": "Write a program that checks a student's grade and prints 'Pass' if the grade is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise prints 'Fail'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks a student's grade and prints 'Pass' if the grade is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise prints 'Fail'.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (float): The student's grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the grade is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if grade < 0 or grade > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid grade. Grade should be between 0 and 100.\")\n    # Check if the grade is greater than or equal to 50\n    elif grade >= 50:\n        print(\"Pass\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Fail\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's grade: \"))\n    check_grade(grade)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_grade` function takes one argument, `grade`, which is the student's grade.\n*   It first checks if the grade is valid (between 0 and 100). If not, it prints an error message.\n*   If the grade is valid, it checks if the grade is greater than or equal to 50. If so, it prints \"Pass\"; otherwise, it prints \"Fail\".\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the student's grade, which is then passed to the `check_grade` function.",
