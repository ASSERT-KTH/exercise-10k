  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores on several assignments:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(assignments, scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the student's grade based on their scores on several assignments.\n\n    Args:\n        assignments (list): A list of assignments with their respective weights.\n        scores (list): A list of scores for each assignment.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The student's grade as a percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the number of assignments and scores match\n    if len(assignments) != len(scores):\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of assignments and scores do not match\")\n\n    # Initialize total score and total weight\n    total_score = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    # Calculate total score and total weight\n    for i in range(len(assignments)):\n        assignment = assignments[i]\n        score = scores[i]\n\n        # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n        if score < 0 or score > 100:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid score: {}\".format(score))\n\n        # Add the weighted score to the total score\n        total_score += assignment['weight'] * score\n\n        # Add the weight to the total weight\n        total_weight += assignment['weight']\n\n    # Check if the total weight is zero to avoid division by zero\n    if total_weight == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Total weight is zero\")\n\n    # Calculate the student's grade\n    grade = total_score / total_weight\n\n    return grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define assignments with their respective weights\n    assignments = [\n        {'name': 'Assignment 1', 'weight': 20},\n        {'name': 'Assignment 2', 'weight': 30},\n        {'name': 'Assignment 3', 'weight': 50}\n    ]\n\n    # Define scores for each assignment\n    scores = [80, 90, 85]\n\n    # Calculate the student's grade\n    try:\n        grade = calculate_grade(assignments, scores)\n        print(\"The student's grade is: {:.2f}%\".format(grade))\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(\"Error: {}\".format(e))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a `calculate_grade` function that takes a list of assignments with their respective weights and a list of scores for each assignment. It calculates the student's grade by summing the weighted scores and dividing by the total weight.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function with sample assignments and scores. It also includes error handling to ensure that the number of assignments and scores match, and that the scores are valid.\n\nYou can modify the assignments and scores in the `main` function to calculate the grade for a specific student.",
