  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input, reverses the order of characters in the first string, and then concatenates the reversed string with the second string.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that matches the specification:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_and_concat(str1, str2):\n    a = str1[::-1]\n    b = a + str2\n    return b\n\nx = \"hello\"\ny = \"world\"\n\nprint(reverse_and_concat(x, y))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `reverse_and_concat` that takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as input, reverses the order of characters in `str1`, and then concatenates the reversed string with `str2`. It then calls this function with the strings `x` and `y` and prints the result.",
