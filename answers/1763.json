  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Squares of Integers in an Array**\n\n### Function Implementation\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of all integers in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(x ** 2 for x in array)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squares:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to calculate the square of each integer in the array and the built-in `sum` function to add up these squares.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. Define the function `sum_of_squares` that takes an array of integers as input.\n2. Use a generator expression `(x ** 2 for x in array)` to calculate the square of each integer in the array.\n3. Pass this generator expression to the `sum` function to calculate the total sum of squares.\n4. Return the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it needs to iterate over each element once.",
