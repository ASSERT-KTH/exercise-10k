  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only the odd numbers. After each odd number, print a message saying 'Odd number found!'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_numbers():\n    i = 1\n    while i <= 10:\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(i)\n            print('Odd number found!')\n        i += 1\n\nprint_odd_numbers()\n```\n\nIn this program, we use a while loop to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, we use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the current number is odd by verifying if the remainder of the division by 2 is not equal to 0. If the number is odd, we print the number and the message 'Odd number found!'.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the odd numbers from 1 to 10, along with the message 'Odd number found!' after each odd number.\n\nExample output:\n```\n1\nOdd number found!\n3\nOdd number found!\n5\nOdd number found!\n7\nOdd number found!\n9\nOdd number found!\n```",
