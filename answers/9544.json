  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n```\n# Get user's name and age\ndef get_user_info():\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Age should be a number.\")\n\n    return name, age\n\n# Print greeting and future age\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    future_age = age + 5\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    print(f\"In 5 years, you will be {future_age} years old.\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_info` function asks the user for their name and age. It checks to ensure that the input for age is a valid integer and keeps asking until a valid input is given.\n* The `print_greeting` function takes the user's name and age, calculates their age in 5 years, and prints out a greeting message with their name and future age.\n* The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_greeting` to print the greeting and future age.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will first ask you to enter your name. After you enter your name, it will ask you to enter your age. If you enter a non-numeric value for your age, it will ask you to enter your age again. Once you enter a valid age, it will print out a greeting message with your name and tell you how old you will be in 5 years.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John!\nIn 5 years, you will be 35 years old.\n```",
