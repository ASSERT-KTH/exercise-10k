  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade. The grade is determined by the following rules: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, print 'Invalid score'. Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Read the score from the user\nscore = int(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n\n# Use conditional statements to determine the grade\nif (score <= 100) and (score >= 90):\n    print(\"Grade is A\")\nelif (score < 90) and (score >= 80):\n    print(\"Grade is B\")\nelif (score < 80) and (score >= 70):\n    print(\"Grade is C\")\nelif (score < 70) and (score >= 60):\n    print(\"Grade is D\")\nelif (score < 60) and (score >= 0):\n    print(\"Grade is F\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid score\")\n\n# Note: This code can be improved by using more concise conditional statements\n```",
