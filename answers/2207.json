It's a tie!\")\n    elif winner == \"User\":\n        print(f\"{user_choice} beats {computer_choice}. You win this round!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{computer_choice} beats {user_choice}. Computer wins this round!\")\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        play_round()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again?
