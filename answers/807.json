  "answer": "Here's a Python code snippet that performs basic arithmetic operations on two integer variables and prints the results:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):\n    # Perform arithmetic operations\n    addition = num1 + num2\n    subtraction = num1 - num2\n    multiplication = num1 * num2\n    division = num1 / num2 if num2 != 0 else \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    modulo = num1 % num2 if num2 != 0 else \"Error: Division by zero\"\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\n    print(f\"Modulo: {num1} % {num2} = {modulo}\")\n\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\nperform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `perform_arithmetic_operations` that takes two integer arguments `num1` and `num2`.\n*   Inside the function, we perform the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.\n*   For division and modulo operations, we include a check to avoid division by zero and print an error message instead.\n*   Finally, we print the results of each operation.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example usage, we set `num1` to 10 and `num2` to 2, and then call the `perform_arithmetic_operations` function with these values. The output will display the results of the arithmetic operations:\n\n```\nAddition: 10 + 2 = 12\nSubtraction: 10 - 2 = 8\nMultiplication: 10 * 2 = 20\nDivision: 10 / 2 = 5.0\nModulo: 10 % 2 = 0\n```",
