  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a mathematical expression until the user types 'quit'. The program should then evaluate the expression using the eval function and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nwhile True:\n    s = input('> ')\n    if s == 'quit':\n        break\n    print(eval(s))\n```\nThis code uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input using the `input` function, and assigns the input to the variable `s`. It then checks if the input is equal to `'quit'`, and if so, breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement. If the input is not `'quit'`, it evaluates the expression using the `eval` function and prints the result using the `print` function.\n\nNote that this code uses the `eval` function to evaluate the user's input as a Python expression, which can pose a security risk if the input comes from an untrusted source. In a real-world application, you would want to add additional error handling and security measures to prevent potential issues.",
