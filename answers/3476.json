  "answer": "**Poem Generator Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a short poem based on user-inputted words and themes.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary of poem templates\npoem_templates = {\n    \"nature\": [\n        \"In the {adjective1} {noun1}, where {plural_noun1} play,\",\n        \"The {adjective2} {noun2} shines bright,\",\n        \"With {adjective3} {noun3} and {plural_noun2} in sight,\",\n        \"The {noun4} whispers secrets of the night.\"\n    ],\n    \"love\": [\n        \"My {adjective1} {noun1} is {adjective2} and true,\",\n        \"With {adjective3} {noun2} and a {adjective4} heart,\",\n        \"In {adjective5} {noun3}, our love will never part,\",\n        \"Together, our {noun4} will forever shine.\"\n    ],\n    \"life\": [\n        \"As I walk through {adjective1} {noun1},\",\n        \"I see {plural_noun1} and {plural_noun2} everywhere,\",\n        \"The {adjective2} {noun2} reminds me to be aware,\",\n        \"Of the {noun3} that life has to share.\"\n    ]\n}\n\ndef generate_poem(theme, words):\n    \"\"\"Generate a poem based on the given theme and words.\"\"\"\n    poem = []\n    template = random.choice(poem_templates[theme])\n    \n    # Split the template into lines\n    lines = template.splitlines()\n    \n    # Replace placeholders with user-inputted words\n    for line in lines:\n        if \"{adjective1}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{adjective1}\", words[\"adjective1\"])\n        if \"{adjective2}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{adjective2}\", words[\"adjective2\"])\n        if \"{adjective3}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{adjective3}\", words[\"adjective3\"])\n        if \"{adjective4}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{adjective4}\", words[\"adjective4\"])\n        if \"{adjective5}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{adjective5}\", words[\"adjective5\"])\n        if \"{noun1}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{noun1}\", words[\"noun1\"])\n        if \"{noun2}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{noun2}\", words[\"noun2\"])\n        if \"{noun3}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{noun3}\", words[\"noun3\"])\n        if \"{noun4}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{noun4}\", words[\"noun4\"])\n        if \"{plural_noun1}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{plural_noun1}\", words[\"plural_noun1\"])\n        if \"{plural_noun2}\" in line:\n            line = line.replace(\"{plural_noun2}\", words[\"plural_noun2\"])\n        poem.append(line)\n    \n    return \"\\n\".join(poem)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Poem Generator!\")\n    theme = input(\"Choose a theme (nature, love, life): \")\n    words = {\n        \"adjective1\": input(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"adjective2\": input(\"Enter another adjective: \"),\n        \"adjective3\": input(\"Enter another adjective: \"),\n        \"adjective4\": input(\"Enter another adjective: \"),\n        \"adjective5\": input(\"Enter another adjective: \"),\n        \"noun1\": input(\"Enter a noun: \"),\n        \"noun2\": input(\"Enter another noun: \"),\n        \"noun3\": input(\"Enter another noun: \"),\n        \"noun4\": input(\"Enter another noun: \"),\n        \"plural_noun1\": input(\"Enter a plural noun: \"),\n        \"plural_noun2\": input(\"Enter another plural noun: \")\n    }\n    \n    poem = generate_poem(theme, words)\n    print(\"\\nHere is your generated poem:\")\n    print(poem)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program and choose a theme (nature, love, life).\n2. Enter the required words (adjectives, nouns, plural nouns) when prompted.\n3. The program will generate a short poem based on your input and display it.\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation, and you can modify and extend the program to include more themes, templates, and features as needed.",
