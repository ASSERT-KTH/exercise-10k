  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns True if the two arrays have no elements in common, and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef check_no_common_elements(list_1, list_2):\n    for element in list_1:\n        if element in list_2:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Test cases\nprint(check_no_common_elements([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: True\nprint(check_no_common_elements([1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6]))  # Output: False\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, using the `for` loop to iterate over `list_1` and checking each element for membership in `list_2` using the `in` operator. If an element is found in both lists, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any common elements, the function returns `True`.\n\nNote that I've also included the two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior, as specified in the requirements.",
