  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array. If the element is not found, return -1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specifications:\n```python\ndef first_occurrence(array, element):\n    for index, value in enumerate(array):\n        if value == element:\n            return index\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\nelement = 23\nindex = first_occurrence(array, element)\nprint(index)  # Output: 5\n```\nThis code defines a function `first_occurrence` that takes an array and an element as input, iterates through the array using `enumerate`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. If the element is not found, it returns -1. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with a sample array and element.",
