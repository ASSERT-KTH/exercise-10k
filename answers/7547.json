  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, then uses another loop to print out the numbers from 10 to 1. The program should also calculate and print the sum of all the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is the complete code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int num = 1, sum = 0;\n\n    while (num <= 10) {\n        cout << num << endl;\n        sum += num;\n        num++;\n    }\n\n    num = 10;\n    while (num >= 1) {\n        cout << num << endl;\n        num--;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Sum: \" << sum << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, and finally print the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10.",
