  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The program should allow users to add students, update grades, and calculate the average grade of all students.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store student grades\nstudent_grades = {}\n\n# Function to add a student\ndef add_student(name, grade):\n    student_grades[name] = grade\n\n# Function to update a student's grade\ndef update_grade(name, new_grade):\n    if name in student_grades:\n        student_grades[name] = new_grade\n    else:\n        print(\"Student not found.\")\n\n# Function to calculate the average grade\ndef calculate_average():\n    total = sum(student_grades.values())\n    average = total / len(student_grades)\n    return average\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\n1. Add student\")\n        print(\"2. Update grade\")\n        print(\"3. Calculate average grade\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n            grade = float(input(\"Enter student's grade: \"))\n            add_student(name, grade)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n            new_grade = float(input(\"Enter new grade: \"))\n            update_grade(name, new_grade)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            average = calculate_average()\n            print(\"The average grade is: \", average)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a dictionary `student_grades` to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. It provides functions to add students, update grades, and calculate the average grade of all students. The `main` function runs a loop to continuously prompt the user for input until the user chooses to exit.",
