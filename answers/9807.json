  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether the user is an adult or not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Importing Modules\nimport os\n\n# Defining the Program\ndef main():\n    # Getting User Input\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    # Printing the Greeting Message\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n\n    # Checking if the User is an Adult\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not an adult.\")\n\n# Running the Program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've used the `int()` function to convert the user's input for age to an integer, as specified in the requirements. I've also used string concatenation to print the greeting message with the user's name. The rest of the code follows the specifications exactly.",
