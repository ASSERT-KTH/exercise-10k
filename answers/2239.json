  "answer": "**Symmetric Difference Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the symmetric difference between two input arrays. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The symmetric difference between the two input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) ^ set(arr2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n    result = symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Symmetric difference:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `symmetric_difference` function takes two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It converts the input arrays to sets using the `set()` function.\n3. The symmetric difference is calculated using the bitwise XOR operator `^`, which returns a new set containing elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n4. The result is converted back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated with two input arrays `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n6. The symmetric difference is printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSymmetric difference: [1, 2, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the result may vary due to the nature of sets. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to iterate over the input arrays and check for membership in the other array.",
