  "prompt": "Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers to find a specific target value.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements a binary search on a sorted list of numbers to find a specific target value:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        guess = sorted_list[mid]\n\n        if guess == target:\n            return mid\n        elif guess > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return None\n\nmy_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(binary_search(my_list, 3))  # Output: 1\n\n# Test cases\nprint(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 1))  # Output: 0\nprint(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 9))  # Output: 4\nprint(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 0))  # Output: None\nprint(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 10))  # Output: None\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `binary_search` that takes a sorted list `sorted_list` and a target value `target` as input. It then performs a binary search on the list to find the target value, and returns the index of the target value if it is found, or `None` if it is not found. The code also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.",
