  "answer": "**Filtering a Dictionary using Dictionary Comprehension**\n===========================================================\n\nYou can filter a dictionary based on a condition using dictionary comprehension in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Example Dictionary\nLet's consider the following dictionary as an example:\n```python\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 19,\n    \"Charlie\": 21\n}\n```\n\n### Filtering the Dictionary\nTo filter the dictionary based on a condition, you can use dictionary comprehension. For example, let's filter the dictionary to include only students who are 21 years old or older:\n```python\nfiltered_students = {name: age for name, age in students.items() if age >= 21}\n```\nThis will create a new dictionary `filtered_students` that includes only the students who meet the condition.\n\n### Code Example\nHere's the complete code example:\n```python\n# Define the dictionary\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 19,\n    \"Charlie\": 21\n}\n\n# Filter the dictionary using dictionary comprehension\nfiltered_students = {name: age for name, age in students.items() if age >= 21}\n\n# Print the filtered dictionary\nprint(filtered_students)\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n{'Alice': 22, 'Charlie': 21}\n```\nIn this example, the dictionary comprehension iterates over the key-value pairs of the `students` dictionary and includes only the pairs where the age is 21 or older.\n\n### Tips and Variations\n\n* You can modify the condition to filter the dictionary based on different criteria. For example, to filter by name, you can use `if name.startswith(\"A\")`.\n* You can also use the `dict()` constructor to create a new dictionary from the filtered key-value pairs.\n* Dictionary comprehension is a concise and efficient way to filter dictionaries, but it may not be suitable for very large datasets. In such cases, you may want to consider using a different approach, such as using a `for` loop or a library like Pandas.",
