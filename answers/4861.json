  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_numbers()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n*   The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.\n*   The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n*   The `print(i)` statement prints the current value of `i` to the console.\n\n**Running the Code:**\n\nSave this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `print_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python print_numbers.py`). The program will print numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```",
