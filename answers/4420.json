  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses the merge sort algorithm with a while loop to sort a list. \n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # If the array has only one element, it's already sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Find the middle of the array\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n\n    # Divide the array into two halves\n    left = arr[:mid]\n    right = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort the two halves\n    left = merge_sort(left)\n    right = merge_sort(right)\n\n    # Merge the two sorted halves\n    return merge(left, right)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n    left (list): The first sorted list.\n    right (list): The second sorted list.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The merged sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    merged = []\n    i = j = 0\n\n    # Merge the two lists\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            merged.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # Append any remaining elements\n    while i < len(left):\n        merged.append(left[i])\n        i += 1\n    while j < len(right):\n        merged.append(right[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return merged\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the merge sort function\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", merge_sort(arr))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe program defines a `merge_sort` function that takes a list as input and returns a sorted list. The function uses recursion to divide the list into smaller sublists until each sublist has only one element, and then merges these sublists back together in sorted order.\n\nThe `merge` function is used to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list. It uses a while loop to compare elements from the two lists and append the smaller element to the merged list.\n\nIn the `main` function, we test the `merge_sort` function with an example list and print the original and sorted lists.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```",
