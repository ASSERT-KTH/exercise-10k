  "answer": "**Capturing a Variable with a Closure**\n======================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that returns a closure, capturing a variable from the surrounding scope:\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(var):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a closure that captures the variable from the surrounding scope.\n    \n    Args:\n    var: The variable to be captured by the closure.\n    \n    Returns:\n    A closure function that takes no arguments and returns the captured variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function():\n        # This function has access to the variables in the surrounding scope\n        return var\n    \n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a closure that captures the variable \"hello\"\n    closure = outer_function(\"hello\")\n    \n    # Call the closure to retrieve the captured variable\n    print(closure())  # Output: hello\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `outer_function` takes a variable `var` as an argument.\n2. The `inner_function` is defined inside `outer_function` and has access to the variables in the surrounding scope, including `var`.\n3. The `outer_function` returns the `inner_function`, which is now a closure that captures the `var` variable.\n4. When the closure is called, it returns the captured `var` variable.\n\n**Important Note**\n-----------------\n\nIn Python, the closure captures the variable by reference, not by value. This means that if the variable changes after the closure is created, the closure will return the new value. For example:\n\n```python\nx = 10\nclosure = outer_function(x)\nprint(closure())  # Output: 10\n\nx = 20\nprint(closure())  # Output: 20\n```\n\nTo capture the variable by value, you can use a default argument in the `inner_function`:\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(var):\n    def inner_function(var=var):\n        return var\n    \n    return inner_function\n```",
