  "answer": "**Deleting an Element from a List**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python function that deletes an element from a list. This function takes in two parameters: the list itself and the index of the element to be deleted.\n\n```python\ndef delete_element(lst, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes an element from a list at the specified index.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list from which to delete the element.\n        index (int): The index of the element to delete.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The updated list with the element deleted.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Check if the index is within the bounds of the list\n        if index < 0 or index >= len(lst):\n            raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n        \n        # Delete the element at the specified index\n        del lst[index]\n        \n        return lst\n    \n    except IndexError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(\"Original List:\", my_list)\n    \n    updated_list = delete_element(my_list, 2)\n    print(\"Updated List:\", updated_list)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The function `delete_element` takes in two parameters: `lst` (the list) and `index` (the index of the element to delete).\n*   It checks if the index is within the bounds of the list. If not, it raises an `IndexError`.\n*   If the index is valid, it deletes the element at that index using the `del` statement.\n*   The function returns the updated list with the element deleted.\n*   In the example usage, we create a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and delete the element at index 2 (which is the number 3). The updated list is then printed.",
