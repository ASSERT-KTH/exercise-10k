The `merge_sort` function takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array.\n2.  The base case for the recursion is when the array has 1 or fewer elements, in which case it's already sorted.\n3.  The array is split into two halves, and each half is recursively sorted using the `merge_sort` function.\n4.  The `merge` function merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n5.  The `merge` function uses indices to keep track of the current position in each array and appends the smaller element to the `merged` array.\n6.  Finally, any remaining elements from either array are appended to the `merged` array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the array in half recursively, resulting in log n levels of recursion, and each level involves merging the elements, which takes O(n) time.",
