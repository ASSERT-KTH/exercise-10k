  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's age as input and classifies them as a child, teenager, adult, or senior. Use if/else statements to determine the classification.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nprint(\"Welcome to the Age Classifier\")\n\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\nif age <= 12:\n    print(\"You are a child\")\nelif age <= 19:\n    print(\"You are a teenager\")\nelif age <= 60:\n    print(\"You are an adult\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are a senior\")\n\nprint(\"Thank you for using the Age Classifier\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. Prints a welcome message to the console.\n2. Asks the user to enter their age using the `input()` function and converts the input to an integer using `int()`.\n3. Uses an `if-elif-else` statement to classify the user's age into one of four categories: child, teenager, adult, or senior.\n4. Prints a message to the console with the classification result.\n5. Prints a thank-you message to the console.\n\nLet me know if this meets your expectations!",
