  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a year and determines whether it is a leap year or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes a year as input and returns `True` if it is a leap year, `False` otherwise.\n2. A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. This is implemented in the `is_leap_year` function.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for a year, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will print \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will print \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is a century year (e.g., 2000): The program will print \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a century year but is divisible by 4 (e.g., 2024): The program will print \"2024 is a leap year.\"",
