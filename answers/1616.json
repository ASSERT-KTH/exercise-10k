  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two integers as input and calculates their Least Common Multiple (LCM).\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(num1 * num2) // math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and calculates their LCM using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a * b| / gcd(a, b)`.\n2. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.\n3. The `main` function gets user input, calculates the LCM, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `12` and `15`\nOutput: `The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60`\n* Input: `24` and `30`\nOutput: `The LCM of 24 and 30 is: 120`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave the code in a file (e.g., `lcm_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python lcm_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers, and the program will output their LCM.",
