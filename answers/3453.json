  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a simple chatbot, where the user can ask the bot a question and the program provides a pre-defined answer",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a chatbot in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with questions and answers\nchatbot_answers = {\n    \"hello\": \"Hi! How can I assist you today?\",\n    \"how are you\": \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\",\n    \"what is your name\": \"My name is SimpleChatBot\",\n    \"what can you do\": \"I can answer your questions and provide information on various topics\",\n    \"default\": \"Sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?\"\n}\n\ndef get_answer(question):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the answer to a given question.\n\n    Args:\n        question (str): The user's question.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The chatbot's answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = question.lower()  # Convert the question to lowercase for case-insensitive matching\n    for key in chatbot_answers:\n        if key in question:\n            return chatbot_answers[key]\n    return chatbot_answers[\"default\"]\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to SimpleChatBot!\")\n    while True:\n        user_question = input(\"You: \")\n        if user_question.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"SimpleChatBot: Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        print(\"SimpleChatBot: \", get_answer(user_question))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. **Chatbot Answers Dictionary**: The program starts by defining a dictionary called `chatbot_answers` where the keys are possible questions and the values are the corresponding answers.\n2. **get_answer Function**: The `get_answer` function takes a question as input, converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive matching, and checks if any of the keys in the `chatbot_answers` dictionary are present in the question. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding answer. If no match is found, it returns the default answer.\n3. **main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It prints a welcome message, enters a loop where it continually asks the user for input, and prints the chatbot's answer to the user's question. The loop continues until the user types \"quit\".\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* User asks \"hello\" and the chatbot responds with \"Hi! How can I assist you today?\"\n* User asks \"how are you\" and the chatbot responds with \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\"\n* User asks an unknown question and the chatbot responds with \"Sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?\"\n* User types \"quit\" to exit the program and the chatbot responds with \"Goodbye!\"",
