  "answer": "**Simple Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program creates a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"Run the calculator program.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n    print(\"5. Quit\")\n\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5): \")\n        if choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        elif choice not in [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n            continue\n\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            try:\n                print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}\")\n            except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n                print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.\n2. The `calculator` function runs the calculator program, displaying a menu of operations and prompting the user to choose one.\n3. The user is asked to input two numbers for the chosen operation.\n4. The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.\n5. The program handles invalid user input and division by zero errors.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and choose operation 1 (addition). Enter two numbers, such as 2 and 3, and the program will display the result: `2 + 3 = 5`.\n* Run the program and choose operation 4 (division). Enter two numbers, such as 4 and 2, and the program will display the result: `4 / 2 = 2.0`.\n* Run the program and choose operation 4 (division). Enter two numbers, such as 4 and 0, and the program will display an error message: `Cannot divide by zero.`",
