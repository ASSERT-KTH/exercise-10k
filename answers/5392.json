  "answer": "### Power Calculation Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following function calculates the power of a given number. It takes two parameters: the base number and the exponent.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the power of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the power operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    base = 2\n    exponent = 3\n    result = calculate_power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_power` takes two parameters: `base` and `exponent`.\n*   It uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the power of the base number.\n*   The result is returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_power` function with a base of 2 and an exponent of 3.\n\n#### Usage\n\nTo use this function, simply call `calculate_power` with the desired base and exponent as arguments. The function will return the result of the power operation.",
