  "answer": "### Subset Check Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following Python function checks if a given list (`subset_list`) is a subset of another list (`main_list`). A subset is defined as a list that contains only elements that are present in the `main_list`.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef is_subset(main_list, subset_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if subset_list is a subset of main_list.\n\n    Args:\n        main_list (list): The main list to check against.\n        subset_list (list): The list to check as a subset.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if subset_list is a subset of main_list, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(subset_list).issubset(set(main_list))\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    subset_list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    subset_list2 = [1, 2, 6]\n\n    print(f\"Is {subset_list1} a subset of {main_list}? {is_subset(main_list, subset_list1)}\")\n    print(f\"Is {subset_list2} a subset of {main_list}? {is_subset(main_list, subset_list2)}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_subset` takes two parameters: `main_list` and `subset_list`.\n2. It converts both lists to sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.\n3. The `issubset` method of the set class checks if all elements of the `subset_list` set are present in the `main_list` set.\n4. The function returns `True` if `subset_list` is a subset of `main_list`, and `False` otherwise.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the order of elements does not matter and that duplicate elements are ignored. If you need to consider the order or duplicates, a different approach may be required.",
