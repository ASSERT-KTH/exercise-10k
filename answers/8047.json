  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses an if/else statement to respond to user input based on the intent of the message. \n\n```python\ndef respond_to_message(message):\n    # Intent dictionary to map intents to responses\n    intent_dict = {\n        \"greeting\": [\"hello\", \"hi\", \"hey\"],\n        \"goodbye\": [\"bye\", \"see you later\", \"goodbye\"],\n        \"thanks\": [\"thanks\", \"thank you\"]\n    }\n\n    # Convert message to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    message = message.lower()\n\n    # Check if message is a greeting\n    if any(intent in message for intent in intent_dict[\"greeting\"]):\n        return \"Hello! How are you today?\"\n\n    # Check if message is a goodbye\n    elif any(intent in message for intent in intent_dict[\"goodbye\"]):\n        return \"See you later! Have a great day!\"\n\n    # Check if message is thanks\n    elif any(intent in message for intent in intent_dict[\"thanks\"]):\n        return \"You're welcome!\"\n\n    # If none of the above intents match, return a default response\n    else:\n        return \"I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Could you please rephrase?\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    while True:\n        message = input(\"You: \")\n        if message.lower() == \"quit\":\n            break\n        response = respond_to_message(message)\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `respond_to_message` function takes a message as input and checks its intent.\n2. It uses a dictionary `intent_dict` to map intents to lists of words that indicate those intents.\n3. The function converts the message to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n4. It then checks if the message contains any of the words in the lists for each intent.\n5. If it finds a match, it returns a corresponding response.\n6. If it doesn't find a match, it returns a default response.\n7. The `main` function runs a loop where it continuously asks the user for input and prints out the chatbot's response until the user types 'quit'.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n- User types \"hello\" and the chatbot responds with \"Hello! How are you today?\".\n- User types \"thanks\" and the chatbot responds with \"You're welcome!\".\n- User types \"I love this chatbot\" and the chatbot responds with \"I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Could you please rephrase?\".",
