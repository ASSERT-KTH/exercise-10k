  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on user input. The user can choose the starting number, ending number, and increment.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(start, end, increment):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence of numbers from start to end with the given increment.\n\n    Args:\n        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.\n        end (int): The ending number of the sequence.\n        increment (int): The increment between each number in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    current = start\n    while current <= end:\n        sequence.append(current)\n        current += increment\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the starting number: \"))\n    end = int(input(\"Enter the ending number: \"))\n    increment = int(input(\"Enter the increment: \"))\n\n    # Generate the sequence\n    sequence = generate_sequence(start, end, increment)\n\n    # Print the sequence\n    print(\"Sequence:\")\n    for num in sequence:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the starting number: 1\n3. Enter the ending number: 10\n4. Enter the increment: 2\n5. The program will print the sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple while loop to generate the sequence.\n* The `generate_sequence` function takes in the starting number, ending number, and increment as arguments and returns a list of numbers in the sequence.\n* The `main` function gets user input, generates the sequence, and prints the result.\n* The program assumes that the user will enter valid integer inputs. You may want to add error handling to handle invalid inputs.",
