  "answer": "**Implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm**\n\n### Overview\n\nBubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using Bubble Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Repeat the process until the list is sorted\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Initialize a flag to check if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate through the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n                # Set the flag to True\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the last iteration, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  It iterates through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.\n3.  If the elements are in the wrong order, it swaps them.\n4.  The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n5.  The function returns the sorted list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the input list is already sorted.\n*   Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the input list is sorted in reverse order.\n*   Average-case time complexity: O(n^2) for random input lists.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the temporary swap variable.",
