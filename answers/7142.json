  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    reversed_s = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        reversed_s = char + reversed_s\n    return reversed_s\n\ndef main():\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    print(\"Reversed string:\", reverse_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `reverse_string` function, which takes a string `s` as input and returns the reversed string. The function iterates over each character in the string, prepending it to the `reversed_s` string.\n\nThe `main` function takes user input, calls the `reverse_string` function, and prints the result.\n\nFinally, the code checks if the script is being run directly (i.e., not being imported as a module) and calls the `main` function if so.",
