  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    factorial = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        factorial *= i\n    return factorial\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif num < 0:\n    print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\nelif num == 0:\n    print(\"Factorial of 0 is 1\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is\", calculate_factorial(num))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `calculate_factorial(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize a variable `factorial` to 1, which will store the factorial of `n`.\n3. **For Loop**: We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, we multiply `factorial` by the current number `i`.\n4. **Return**: After the loop finishes, we return the calculated factorial.\n5. **Main Program**: We ask the user to enter a number and check if it's negative. If it's negative, we print an error message. If it's 0, we print 1 (since the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1). Otherwise, we call the `calculate_factorial` function and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Input: `5`\nOutput: `Factorial of 5 is 120`\n* Input: `0`\nOutput: `Factorial of 0 is 1`\n* Input: `-3`\nOutput: `Factorial is not defined for negative numbers`",
