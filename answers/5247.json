  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.\n        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.\n        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.\n        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Calculate the distance using the Euclidean distance formula\n    distance = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)\n\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the distance between the two points\n    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The distance between the two points is: \", distance)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_distance` function takes the coordinates of two points as input and returns the distance between them.\n*   The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: `distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n*   The `main` function gets the coordinates of the two points from the user, calls the `calculate_distance` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the distance between two points on a map.\n*   Calculate the distance between two objects in a 2D game.\n*   Calculate the distance between two points in a computer-aided design (CAD) program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define the `calculate_distance` function with four arguments: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.\n2.  Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates: `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1`.\n3.  Calculate the distance using the Euclidean distance formula: `distance = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)`.\n4.  Return the calculated distance.\n5.  In the `main` function, get the coordinates of the two points from the user.\n6.  Call the `calculate_distance` function with the user-input coordinates.\n7.  Print the calculated distance.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Use the `math` module to access the `sqrt` function for calculating the square root.\n*   Use the `**` operator to calculate the square of a number.\n*   Use the `float` data type to handle decimal numbers.\n*   Use the `input` function to get user input, and convert it to `float` using the `float()` function.",
