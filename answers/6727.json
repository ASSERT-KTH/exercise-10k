  "answer": "**String Reader and Writer Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program reads and writes strings of data to a file. It provides two main functions: `read_string` and `write_string`.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef read_string(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a string from a file.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to read from.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string read from the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n            return file.read()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n        return None\n\n\ndef write_string(filename, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes a string to a file.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to write to.\n        data (str): The string to write to the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n        file.write(data)\n\n\ndef main():\n    filename = input(\"Enter the filename: \")\n    action = input(\"Do you want to read or write? (r/w): \")\n\n    if action.lower() == 'r':\n        print(read_string(filename))\n    elif action.lower() == 'w':\n        data = input(\"Enter the string to write: \")\n        write_string(filename, data)\n        print(f\"String written to {filename} successfully.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid action. Please enter 'r' or 'w'.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `read_string` function opens the specified file in read mode and returns the contents as a string. If the file does not exist, it prints an error message and returns `None`.\n2. The `write_string` function opens the specified file in write mode and writes the provided string to the file.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the filename and the action they want to perform (read or write). Depending on the action, it calls the corresponding function and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Reading a string from a file:\n\t+ Enter the filename: `example.txt`\n\t+ Do you want to read or write? (r/w): `r`\n\t+ Output: The contents of `example.txt` will be printed to the console.\n* Writing a string to a file:\n\t+ Enter the filename: `example.txt`\n\t+ Do you want to read or write? (r/w): `w`\n\t+ Enter the string to write: `Hello, World!`\n\t+ Output: The string \"Hello, World!\" will be written to `example.txt`.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the file is in the same directory as the script. If the file is in a different directory, you need to provide the full path to the file.",
