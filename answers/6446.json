  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the average of a given set of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of the numbers, and then divides by the total count of numbers to get the average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a given set of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the given numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    count = len(numbers)\n    average = total / count\n\n    return average\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the count of numbers using the `len` function.\n5. It calculates the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[90, 80, 70, 60, 50]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[23.5, 25.2, 27.8, 30.1, 32.5]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle edge cases, such as an empty input list.\n* Use built-in functions like `sum` and `len` to simplify the code.\n* Consider adding input validation to ensure that the input list only contains numbers.",
