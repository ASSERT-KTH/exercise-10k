  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and outputs its volume.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length:\n```\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the side length from the user\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the volume\n    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes a single argument `side_length`, which is the length of one side of the cube.\n2. The function calculates the volume of the cube using the formula `volume = side_length ** 3`, which is equivalent to `volume = side_length * side_length * side_length`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube, converts the input to a float using `float(input(...))`, and passes it to the `calculate_cube_volume` function.\n4. The `main` function then prints the calculated volume to the console using an f-string.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `cube_volume.py`) and run it from the command line using `python cube_volume.py`. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the side length of the cube, and then print the calculated volume.",
