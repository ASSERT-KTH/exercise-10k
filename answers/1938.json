  "answer": "**Immutable Variables Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the immutability of tuples and strings in Python. It shows how attempting to modify these data types results in an error.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Create a tuple\n    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n    print(\"Original Tuple:\", my_tuple)\n\n    # Attempt to modify the tuple\n    try:\n        my_tuple[0] = 10\n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n    # Create a string\n    my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"\\nOriginal String:\", my_string)\n\n    # Attempt to modify the string\n    try:\n        my_string[0] = 'J'\n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n    # Create a new tuple and string to demonstrate immutability\n    new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)\n    new_string = my_string.replace('H', 'J')\n    print(\"\\nNew Tuple:\", new_tuple)\n    print(\"New String:\", new_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Output**\n--------\n\n```\nOriginal Tuple: (1, 2, 3)\nError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n\nOriginal String: Hello, World!\nError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\nNew Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nNew String: Jello, World!\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We create a tuple `my_tuple` and a string `my_string`.\n2.  We attempt to modify the first element of `my_tuple` and the first character of `my_string`. This results in a `TypeError` because tuples and strings are immutable in Python.\n3.  To demonstrate immutability, we create a new tuple `new_tuple` by concatenating `my_tuple` with another tuple. We create a new string `new_string` by replacing the first character of `my_string`.\n4.  The output shows that the original tuple and string remain unchanged, while the new tuple and string are created successfully.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n*   In Python, tuples and strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation.\n*   Attempting to modify an immutable object results in a `TypeError`.\n*   To create a modified version of an immutable object, you must create a new object.",
