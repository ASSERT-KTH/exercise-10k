  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not for all years up to `n`.\n\n```python\ndef check_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"Checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.\"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef check_leap_years_up_to_n(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks whether each year up to n is a leap year or not using a for loop.\"\"\"\n    for year in range(1, n + 1):\n        if check_leap_year(year):\n            print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"Checking leap years up to {n}:\")\ncheck_leap_years_up_to_n(n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `check_leap_year` function checks whether a given year is a leap year or not by applying the following rules:\n   - The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n   - If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible by 400.\n2. The `check_leap_years_up_to_n` function uses a for loop to check each year up to `n` using the `check_leap_year` function and prints whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nChecking leap years up to 10:\n1 is not a leap year.\n2 is not a leap year.\n3 is not a leap year.\n4 is a leap year.\n5 is not a leap year.\n6 is not a leap year.\n7 is not a leap year.\n8 is a leap year.\n9 is not a leap year.\n10 is not a leap year.\n```",
