  "answer": "**Cone Surface Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cone given its radius and height. The surface area of a cone is the sum of the area of its base and the area of its lateral surface.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\n`A = \u03c0r^2 + \u03c0rl`\n\nwhere:\n- `A` is the surface area of the cone\n- `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- `r` is the radius of the base of the cone\n- `l` is the slant height of the cone, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: `l = \u221a(r^2 + h^2)`\n- `h` is the height of the cone\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cone_surface_area(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cone given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the base of the cone.\n        height (float): The height of the cone.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the slant height of the cone\n    slant_height = math.sqrt(radius**2 + height**2)\n\n    # Calculate the surface area of the cone\n    surface_area = math.pi * radius**2 + math.pi * radius * slant_height\n\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the radius and height of the cone from the user\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cone: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cone: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the surface area of the cone\n    surface_area = calculate_cone_surface_area(radius, height)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The surface area of the cone is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the cone when prompted (e.g., 5).\n3. Enter the height of the cone when prompted (e.g., 10).\n4. The program will calculate and print the surface area of the cone.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` library for mathematical constants and functions. The `calculate_cone_surface_area` function takes the radius and height of the cone as input and returns the calculated surface area. The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `calculate_cone_surface_area` function, and prints the result.",
