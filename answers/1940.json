  "prompt": "Write a program that uses type hinting to specify the expected data type of a variable.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that uses type hinting to specify the expected data type of a variable:\n\n```python\ndef greeting(name: str) -> str:\n    return 'Hello ' + name\n\nprint(greeting(\"John\"))  # Outputs: Hello John\nprint(greeting(123))     # Outputs: Hello 123, but this will raise a warning in some IDEs or type checkers\n```\n\nIn this program, the `greeting` function expects a string as input and returns a string as output. The `str` type hint is used to indicate this.\n\nPlease note that Python is dynamically typed, which means that it does not enforce type hints at runtime. Type hints are primarily used for documentation, IDE auto-completion, and static type checking tools.\n\nTo enforce type hints at runtime, you can use a library like `mypy` or `typeguard`. Here's an example using `typeguard`:\n\n```python\nfrom typeguard import typechecked\n\n@typechecked\ndef greeting(name: str) -> str:\n    return 'Hello ' + name\n\nprint(greeting(\"John\"))  # Outputs: Hello John\ntry:\n    print(greeting(123))     # Raises a TypeError\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `@typechecked` decorator is used to enforce the type hints of the `greeting` function. If a wrong type is passed to the function, it will raise a `TypeError`.",
