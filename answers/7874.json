  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that checks if a word is in a dictionary using conditional statements:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary\ndictionary = {\n    \"apple\": \"A type of fruit\",\n    \"car\": \"A type of vehicle\",\n    \"house\": \"A type of building\",\n    \"tree\": \"A type of plant\"\n}\n\ndef check_word(word):\n    # Convert the word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    word = word.lower()\n\n    # Check if the word is in the dictionary\n    if word in dictionary:\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is in the dictionary.\")\n        print(f\"Meaning: {dictionary[word]}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is not in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Test the function\ncheck_word(\"apple\")\ncheck_word(\"house\")\ncheck_word(\"dog\")\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Define a dictionary**: We create a dictionary with some words and their meanings.\n2. **Create a function**: The `check_word` function takes a word as input and checks if it's in the dictionary.\n3. **Convert to lowercase**: We convert the input word to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n4. **Check if the word is in the dictionary**: We use an `if` statement to check if the word is in the dictionary. If it is, we print a message indicating that the word is in the dictionary, along with its meaning.\n5. **Test the function**: We call the `check_word` function with some test words to demonstrate its usage.\n\n### Example output:\n```\nThe word 'apple' is in the dictionary.\nMeaning: A type of fruit\nThe word 'house' is in the dictionary.\nMeaning: A type of building\nThe word 'dog' is not in the dictionary.\n```\n\nNote that this program uses a simple dictionary with a limited number of words. In a real-world application, you might want to use a more comprehensive dictionary or a word-list API to check for word existence.",
