  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers within a given range (inclusive) using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, both of which are integers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef sum_numbers(start, end):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        sum = sum + i\n    return sum\n\ndef main():\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the start of the range: \"))\n    end = int(input(\"Enter the end of the range: \"))\n    result = sum_numbers(start, end)\n    print(f\"The sum of the numbers in the range is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, using a `for` loop to sum the numbers in the range, and a `main` function to get the input from the user and print the result.",
