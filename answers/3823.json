  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user to guess the number\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is a valid number\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)`.\n2. The program enters a loop where it asks the user to guess the number.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is a valid number and if it's in the correct range.\n4. If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a success message and exits the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback (too low or too high) and asks the user to guess again.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `random_number_guessing_game.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python random_number_guessing_game.py`).
