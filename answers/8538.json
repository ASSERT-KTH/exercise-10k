  "answer": "**Cylinder Surface Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe surface area of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\n`A = 2 * \u03c0 * r * (r + h)`\n\nWhere:\n- `A` is the surface area\n- `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- `r` is the radius of the cylinder\n- `h` is the height of the cylinder\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative.\")\n\n    surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * (radius + height)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cylinder: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cylinder: \"))\n\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cylinder is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the cylinder when prompted.\n3. Enter the height of the cylinder when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the surface area of the cylinder.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf you enter a radius of `5` and a height of `10`, the program will output:\n\n`The surface area of the cylinder is: 471.24`\n\nNote: The actual output may vary slightly due to the precision of the `math.pi` constant.",
