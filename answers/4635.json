  "answer": "**Array Difference Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two input arrays. The difference is defined as the elements that are present in the first array but not in the second array, and vice versa.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef array_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The difference between the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input lists to sets for efficient lookups\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n\n    # Calculate the difference between the two sets\n    diff1 = set1 - set2\n    diff2 = set2 - set1\n\n    # Combine the differences into a single list\n    difference = list(diff1) + list(diff2)\n\n    return difference\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Difference:\", array_difference(arr1, arr2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `array_difference` function takes two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It converts the input lists to sets for efficient lookups.\n3. It calculates the difference between the two sets using the `-` operator.\n4. It combines the differences into a single list.\n5. The function returns the difference list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nDifference: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nNote: The order of the elements in the difference list may vary depending on the implementation.",
