  "answer": "### Asynchronous Function Example\n#### Overview\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates a simple asynchronous function using Python's `asyncio` library. This function simulates two asynchronous operations: fetching data from two different APIs.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\nasync def fetch_data(api_name):\n    \"\"\"Simulate fetching data from an API.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Fetching data from {api_name}...\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate API call delay\n    print(f\"Data fetched from {api_name}.\")\n    return f\"Data from {api_name}\"\n\nasync def main():\n    \"\"\"Perform asynchronous operations.\"\"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n\n    # Perform asynchronous operations concurrently\n    task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(\"API 1\"))\n    task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(\"API 2\"))\n\n    # Wait for both tasks to complete\n    result1 = await task1\n    result2 = await task2\n\n    print(f\"Results: {result1}, {result2}\")\n    print(f\"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds\")\n\n# Run the asynchronous main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We define an asynchronous function `fetch_data` that simulates fetching data from an API. It uses `asyncio.sleep` to introduce a delay, mimicking the time it takes to receive a response from an API.\n2. In the `main` function, we create two tasks that run `fetch_data` concurrently using `asyncio.create_task`.\n3. We use `await` to wait for both tasks to complete and retrieve their results.\n4. Finally, we print the results and the total execution time.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nRunning this code will output:\n```\nFetching data from API 1...\nFetching data from API 2...\nData fetched from API 1.\nData fetched from API 2.\nResults: Data from API 1, Data from API 2\nTotal execution time: 2.002343 seconds\n```\nThe total execution time is approximately 2 seconds, which is the delay introduced by `asyncio.sleep`. If the operations were performed sequentially, the total execution time would be around 4 seconds. This demonstrates the benefits of using asynchronous programming to improve performance in I/O-bound applications.",
