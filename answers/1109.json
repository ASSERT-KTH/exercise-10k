  "answer": "**Mixture Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the amount of each ingredient needed to make a mixture given the total amount and percentage of each ingredient.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_ingredients(total_amount, ingredients):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the amount of each ingredient needed to make a mixture.\n\n    Args:\n        total_amount (float): The total amount of the mixture.\n        ingredients (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the ingredient names and the values are the percentages.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the ingredient names and the values are the calculated amounts.\n    \"\"\"\n    calculated_ingredients = {}\n    for ingredient, percentage in ingredients.items():\n        calculated_ingredients[ingredient] = (percentage / 100) * total_amount\n    return calculated_ingredients\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    total_amount = float(input(\"Enter the total amount of the mixture: \"))\n    num_ingredients = int(input(\"Enter the number of ingredients: \"))\n\n    ingredients = {}\n    for i in range(num_ingredients):\n        ingredient_name = input(f\"Enter the name of ingredient {i+1}: \")\n        percentage = float(input(f\"Enter the percentage of {ingredient_name}: \"))\n        ingredients[ingredient_name] = percentage\n\n    calculated_ingredients = calculate_ingredients(total_amount, ingredients)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculated Ingredients:\")\n    for ingredient, amount in calculated_ingredients.items():\n        print(f\"{ingredient}: {amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the total amount of the mixture when prompted.\n3. Enter the number of ingredients when prompted.\n4. Enter the name and percentage of each ingredient when prompted.\n5. The program will calculate and display the amount of each ingredient needed to make the mixture.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a dictionary to store the ingredients and their corresponding percentages.\n* The `calculate_ingredients` function takes the total amount and the ingredients dictionary as input and returns a dictionary with the calculated amounts.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output, and calls the `calculate_ingredients` function to perform the calculations.",
