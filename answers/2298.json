  "answer": "**Game of Chance Simulator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a simple game of chance where the user can bet on the outcome of a random event. The user can choose to play either a coin flip game or a die roll game.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip_game():\n    \"\"\"Simulates a coin flip game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the coin flip game!\")\n    bet = input(\"Do you want to bet on heads or tails? \")\n    outcome = random.choice([\"heads\", \"tails\"])\n    print(f\"The coin landed on {outcome}.\")\n    if bet.lower() == outcome:\n        print(\"You win!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You lose!\")\n\ndef die_roll_game():\n    \"\"\"Simulates a die roll game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the die roll game!\")\n    bet = int(input(\"Do you want to bet on a number between 1 and 6? \"))\n    outcome = random.randint(1, 6)\n    print(f\"The die rolled a {outcome}.\")\n    if bet == outcome:\n        print(\"You win!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You lose!\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Game of Chance Simulator\")\n    print(\"1. Coin Flip Game\")\n    print(\"2. Die Roll Game\")\n    choice = input(\"Which game do you want to play? (1/2) \")\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        coin_flip_game()\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        die_roll_game()\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Coin Flip Game**\n\t* User chooses to play the coin flip game.\n\t* User bets on either heads or tails.\n\t* The program simulates a coin flip and determines the outcome.\n\t* The program prints the outcome and declares the user a winner or loser.\n2. **Die Roll Game**\n\t* User chooses to play the die roll game.\n\t* User bets on a number between 1 and 6.\n\t* The program simulates a die roll and determines the outcome.\n\t* The program prints the outcome and declares the user a winner or loser.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `game_of_chance.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program by typing `python game_of_chance.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to choose a game and place a bet.\n\nNote: This program uses the `random` module to simulate random events. The outcomes are determined randomly and are not influenced by the user's bets.",
