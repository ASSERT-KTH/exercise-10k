  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and an element as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    try:\n        return lst.index(elem)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nelem = 3\nprint(find_index(lst, elem))  # Output: 2\n```\nNote that I've added some example usage at the end to demonstrate how the function can be used. The `find_index` function takes a list `lst` and an element `elem` as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in `lst`. If `elem` is not found in `lst`, the function returns `-1` to indicate that the element was not found.",
