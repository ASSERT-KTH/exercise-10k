  "answer": "**Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the longest substring with exactly `k` distinct characters.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. The idea is to maintain a window of characters and expand or shrink it based on the number of distinct characters.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef longest_substring_with_k_distinct(s: str, k: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest substring with k distinct characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n    k (int): The number of distinct characters.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring with k distinct characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s or k == 0:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Initialize variables\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_count = defaultdict(int)\n    window_start = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the string\n    for window_end in range(len(s)):\n        # Add the current character to the window\n        char_count[s[window_end]] += 1\n\n        # Shrink the window if the number of distinct characters exceeds k\n        while len(char_count) > k:\n            char_count[s[window_start]] -= 1\n            if char_count[s[window_start]] == 0:\n                del char_count[s[window_start]]\n            window_start += 1\n\n        # Update the maximum length and substring\n        if len(char_count) == k and window_end - window_start + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = window_end - window_start + 1\n            max_substring = s[window_start:window_end + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"araaci\"\nk = 2\nprint(longest_substring_with_k_distinct(s, k))  # Output: \"araa\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length and substring, as well as a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the window.\n2.  Iterate over the string, expanding the window by adding the current character.\n3.  If the number of distinct characters in the window exceeds `k`, shrink the window by removing the character at the start of the window.\n4.  Update the maximum length and substring if the current window has `k` distinct characters and its length exceeds the maximum length found so far.\n5.  Return the longest substring with `k` distinct characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we make a single pass over the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, since we store the count of each character in the window. In the worst case, the window can contain all distinct characters, resulting in a space complexity of O(m). However, in practice, the space complexity is typically much smaller than O(n) since the number of distinct characters is usually limited.",
