  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a string and counts the number of characters in it.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef count_characters():\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    character_count = len(user_string)\n    print(f\"The string '{user_string}' has {character_count} characters.\")\n\ncount_characters()\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1. We define a function `count_characters()` that contains the program's logic.\n2. We use the built-in `input()` function to ask the user for a string and store it in the `user_string` variable.\n3. We use the built-in `len()` function to count the number of characters in the string.\n4. We print out the character count along with the original string.\n5. Finally, we call the `count_characters()` function to start the program.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `character_counter.py`) and run it from the command line using `python character_counter.py`. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a string, and then it will print out the character count.",
