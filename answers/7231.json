  "prompt": "Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]\n    for score in scores:\n        print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {calculate_grade(score)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n*   The `if-elif-else` statement is used to check the conditions and return the grade.\n*   The `main` function tests the `calculate_grade` function with a list of scores and prints the score and the corresponding grade.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line is used to ensure that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   `calculate_grade(95)` returns `'A'`\n*   `calculate_grade(85)` returns `'B'`\n*   `calculate_grade(75)` returns `'C'`\n*   `calculate_grade(65)` returns `'D'`\n*   `calculate_grade(55)` returns `'F'`\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_grade` that takes a `score` as input.\n2.  Use an `if-elif-else` statement to check the conditions and return the grade.\n3.  Test the function with a list of scores and print the score and the corresponding grade.\n4.  Call the `main` function when the script is run directly.",
