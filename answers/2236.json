  "answer": "**List Intersection Program**\n================================\n\nThis program takes two lists as input and returns their intersection, i.e., the elements that are common to both lists.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the intersection of two lists.\n    \n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(list_intersection(list1, list2))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `list_intersection` function takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `list1`.\n3. For each element, it checks if the element is also present in `list2` using the `in` operator.\n4. If the element is found in `list2`, it is included in the resulting list.\n5. The function returns the resulting list, which is the intersection of `list1` and `list2`.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can also use the `set` data structure to find the intersection of two lists:\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n```\n\nThis implementation converts both lists to sets, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converts the resulting set back to a list. Note that this implementation does not preserve the original order of elements.",
