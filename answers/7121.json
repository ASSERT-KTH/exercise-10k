Each function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n\n*   The `add` function returns the sum of two numbers using the `+` operator.\n*   The `subtract` function returns the difference of two numbers using the `-` operator.\n*   The `multiply` function returns the product of two numbers using the `*` operator.\n*   The `divide` function returns the quotient of two numbers using the `/` operator. It also includes a check to prevent division by zero, raising a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.\n\nThe `main` function serves as the program's entry point. It prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation to perform. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function and displays the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1.  **Addition**: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and choose operation `1` (Addition). The program will output: `Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0`\n2.  **Subtraction**: Enter `15` as the first number, `8` as the second number, and choose operation `2` (Subtraction). The program will output: `Result: 15.0 - 8.0 = 7.0`\n3.  **Multiplication**: Enter `4` as the first number, `6` as the second number, and choose operation `3` (Multiplication). The program will output: `Result: 4.0 * 6.0 = 24.0`\n4.  **Division**: Enter `12` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and choose operation `4` (Division). The program will output: `Result: 12.0 / 3.0 = 4.0`\n\nNote: The program handles division by zero by raising an error and displaying an error message.",
