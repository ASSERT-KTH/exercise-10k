  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a mathematical expression as input from the user, evaluates it, and prints the result. The expression should be a simple arithmetic operation involving two numbers and one of the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements. It uses the `eval` function to evaluate the mathematical expression.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates a simple arithmetic expression involving two numbers and one of the four basic arithmetic operators.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    None\n    \n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get user input for the mathematical expression\n    expression = input(\"Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 2+2, 5*3, 10/2): \")\n    \n    try:\n        # Evaluate the expression using eval function\n        result = eval(expression)\n        \n        # Print the result\n        print(f\"The result of the expression '{expression}' is: {result}\")\n    \n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        # Handle division by zero error\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    \n    except SyntaxError:\n        # Handle invalid syntax error\n        print(\"Error: Invalid syntax. Please enter a valid mathematical expression.\")\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any other exceptions\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    evaluate_expression()\n```\n\nYou can run this program, and it will prompt you to enter a mathematical expression. After entering the expression, it will evaluate it and print the result. If any error occurs during evaluation (e.g., division by zero, invalid syntax), it will catch the exception and print an error message.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   Enter a simple addition expression: `2+2`\n*   Enter a multiplication expression: `5*3`\n*   Enter a division expression: `10/2`\n*   Enter an invalid expression to test error handling: `2++2` or `5/0`\n\nRemember to use this program responsibly, as the `eval` function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input. In this case, since we're taking input from the user, it's essential to be aware of the potential risks.",
