  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a function that takes a list and a key function as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique value returned by the key function, and the corresponding value is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key. This function will help you group elements in a list based on a custom key. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef group_by_key(lst, key_func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and a key function as input, \n    and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique value \n    returned by the key function, and the corresponding value \n    is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list to be grouped.\n        key_func (function): A function that takes an element of the list as input and returns a key.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is a unique value returned by the key function, \n              and the corresponding value is a list of elements for which the key function returned that key.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped elements\n    grouped_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Calculate the key for the current element using the key function\n        key = key_func(element)\n        \n        # If the key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value\n        if key not in grouped_dict:\n            # This is done to avoid a KeyError when trying to append to a non-existent key\n            grouped_dict[key] = []\n        \n        # Append the current element to the list of its corresponding key in the dictionary\n        grouped_dict[key].append(element)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with the grouped elements\n    return grouped_dict\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `group_by_key` initializes an empty dictionary `grouped_dict` to store the grouped elements. It then iterates over each element in the input list `lst`.\n* For each element, it calculates the key using the `key_func` and checks if the key is already in `grouped_dict`. If not, it adds the key with an empty list as its value.\n* The function then appends the current element to the list of its corresponding key in `grouped_dict`.\n* Finally, it returns the dictionary `grouped_dict` with the grouped elements.",
