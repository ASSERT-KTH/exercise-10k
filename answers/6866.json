  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, z;\n    printf(\"Enter three integers (x, y, z): \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x, &y, &z);\n\n    printf(\"x + y = %d\\n\", x + y);\n    printf(\"x - y = %d\\n\", x - y);\n    printf(\"x * y = %d\\n\", x * y);\n\n    if (z != 0) {\n        printf(\"x / z = %d\\n\", x / z);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the step-by-step breakdown provided in the specification. It includes the necessary header file, defines the `main` function, declares integer variables, prompts the user for input, reads the input, performs arithmetic operations, performs division with error checking, and returns an integer value.",
