  "answer": "**Common Characters Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the common characters between two given strings. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in both strings and then returns a list of common characters.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef common_characters(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the common characters between two given strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of common characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both strings to lower case to ignore case sensitivity\n    str1 = str1.lower()\n    str2 = str2.lower()\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character in str1\n    str1_count = {}\n    for char in str1:\n        if char in str1_count:\n            str1_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            str1_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character in str2\n    str2_count = {}\n    for char in str2:\n        if char in str2_count:\n            str2_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            str2_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Find the common characters\n    common_chars = []\n    for char in str1_count:\n        if char in str2_count:\n            common_chars.extend([char] * min(str1_count[char], str2_count[char]))\n\n    return common_chars\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"Hello\"\nstr2 = \"World\"\nprint(common_characters(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two strings as input and converts them to lower case to ignore case sensitivity.\n2. It creates two dictionaries to store the count of each character in both strings.\n3. It then iterates over the characters in the first string's dictionary and checks if the character exists in the second string's dictionary.\n4. If the character exists, it adds the character to the `common_chars` list the minimum number of times it appears in both strings.\n5. Finally, the function returns the `common_chars` list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input strings. This is because the function iterates over each character in both strings once. The space complexity is also O(n + m), as the function stores the count of each character in two dictionaries.",
