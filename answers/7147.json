  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of integers and a mapping function as input. The function should apply the mapping function to each element in the list and return the resulting list. The mapping function should take an integer and return its square.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a mapping function to each element in a list of integers and returns the resulting list. This function will specifically use a mapping function that takes an integer and returns its square. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef square_mapping_function(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an integer as input and returns its square.\n    \n    Args:\n        number (int): The input integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The square of the input integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The function simply returns the square of the input number\n    return number ** 2\n\n\ndef apply_mapping_function(numbers, mapping_function):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function applies a given mapping function to each element in a list of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n        mapping_function (function): A function that takes an integer and returns a transformed integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers where each element is the result of applying the mapping function to the corresponding element in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Apply the mapping function to the current number and append the result to the result list\n        result.append(mapping_function(number))\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = apply_mapping_function(numbers, square_mapping_function)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `square_mapping_function` is defined to take an integer `number` as input and return its square using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n* The `apply_mapping_function` is a general-purpose function that applies a given `mapping_function` to each element in a list of `numbers`. It iterates over the input list, applies the mapping function to each element, and stores the results in a new list called `result`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `apply_mapping_function` with the `square_mapping_function` as the mapping function. It passes a list of integers `numbers` and the `square_mapping_function` to `apply_mapping_function`, and prints the resulting list of squared numbers.\n* The code is well-structured and readable, with clear documentation and comments explaining the purpose and behavior of each function.",
