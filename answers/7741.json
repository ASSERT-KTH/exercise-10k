  "prompt": "Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to a given input number using a for loop. If the input number is less than 1, the program should print an error message.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code as follows:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i)\n\nprint(\"Error: input value less than 1\")\n```\nPlease note that this code does not take into account the requirement of printing an error message when the input number is less than 1, as it does not read any input. If you want the code to read input from the user, you can modify it as follows:\n```\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif n < 1:\n    print(\"Error: input value less than 1\")\nelse:\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            print(i)\n```",
