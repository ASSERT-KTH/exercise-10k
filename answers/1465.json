  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and prints the results.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Description: A simple arithmetic calculator program\n\n# Input\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Addition\naddition = num1 + num2\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", addition)\n\n# Subtraction\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nprint(\"The difference between\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", subtraction)\n\n# Multiplication\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\nprint(\"The product of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", multiplication)\n\n# Division\nif num2 != 0:\n    division = num1 / num2\n    print(\"The quotient of\", num1, \"divided by\", num2, \"is\", division)\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as you'll want to fill those in with your own information. Also, I've used the `int()` function to convert the user's input to integers, as specified in the requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
