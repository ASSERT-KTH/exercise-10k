  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the Levenshtein distance algorithm as described in the specification:\n```\ndef min_operations(str1, str2):\n    m = len(str1)\n    n = len(str2)\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store the Levenshtein distances\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the first row and column of the 2D array\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the 2D array\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])\n\n    # Return the minimum number of operations\n    return dp[m][n]\n```\nThis code takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform `str1` into `str2`. It uses dynamic programming to build a 2D array `dp` that stores the Levenshtein distances between substrings of `str1` and `str2`. The final result is stored in the cell at `(m, n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.",
