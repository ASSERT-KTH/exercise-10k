  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):  # Loop through numbers from 1 to 10\n        total_sum += i  # Add each number to the total sum\n    return total_sum\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    result = calculate_sum()\n    print(\"The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_sum()` that initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0.\n2. We use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 using the `range()` function.\n3. Inside the loop, we add each number to the `total_sum`.\n4. After the loop, we return the `total_sum`.\n5. In the `main()` function, we call `calculate_sum()` and print the result.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\nSave the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `sum_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python sum_calculator.py`). The program will output the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, which is 55.",
