  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\n### Description\n\nA simple quiz program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the required modules\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\": \"Mars\",\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?\": \"William Shakespeare\"\n}\n\ndef run_quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Ask each question and check the answer\n    for question, answer in quiz_questions.items():\n        user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    run_quiz()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question when prompted.\n3. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n4. After all questions have been asked, the program will display your final score.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `quiz_questions` with quiz questions as keys and answers as values.\n2. The `run_quiz` function asks each question, checks the user's answer, and updates the score accordingly.\n3. The `main` function runs the quiz and prints a welcome message.\n4. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the questions and answers in the dictionary.",
