  "answer": "**Generator Function Example**\n================================\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses a generator to produce a sequence of numbers. This function generates the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n    \n    Yields:\n        int: The next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    print(f\"First {n} Fibonacci numbers:\")\n    for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(n)):\n        print(f\"F({i}) = {num}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function `fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n2. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. The function uses a `for` loop to generate the sequence. In each iteration, it yields the current value of `a`, which is the next number in the sequence.\n4. The values of `a` and `b` are updated for the next iteration using the recurrence relation `a, b = b, a + b`.\n5. The `yield` statement produces a value from the generator, allowing the caller to iterate over the sequence.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nFirst 10 Fibonacci numbers:\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1\nF(3) = 2\nF(4) = 3\nF(5) = 5\nF(6) = 8\nF(7) = 13\nF(8) = 21\nF(9) = 34\n```",
