  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    years = [1999, 2000, 2004, 2100]\n    for year in years:\n        if is_leap_year(year):\n            print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.\n2. The function checks the following conditions:\n   - The year must be divisible by 4.\n   - If the year is a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `is_leap_year` function with example years.\n\n### Output\n\n```\n1999 is not a leap year.\n2000 is a leap year.\n2004 is a leap year.\n2100 is not a leap year.\n```",
