  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a reducing function as input, and returns the result of applying the reducing function to all elements of the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef reduce_list(list_1, func):\n    if len(list_1) < 2:\n        return list_1\n    result = list_1[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(list_1)):\n        result = func(result, list_1[i])\n    return result\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification and implemented the `reduce_list` function as described. The function takes two inputs: `list_1` and `func`, and returns the result of applying the reducing function to all elements of the list. The function uses a simple iterative approach to apply the reducing function to each element of the list, starting with the first element and accumulating the result.",
