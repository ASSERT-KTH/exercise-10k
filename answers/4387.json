  "prompt": "Understand the scope of variables in different contexts",
  "answer": "Understanding the scope of variables is crucial in programming, as it determines the accessibility and lifetime of a variable. The scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where the variable is defined and can be accessed. Here's a breakdown of the scope of variables in different contexts:\n\n**1. Local Scope**\n\nIn a local scope, a variable is defined within a block of code, such as a function, loop, or conditional statement. The variable is only accessible within that block and is destroyed when the block is exited.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    x = 10  # local variable\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n\nmy_function()\nprint(x)  # raises a NameError, x is not defined\n```\n**2. Global Scope**\n\nIn a global scope, a variable is defined outside of any block of code and is accessible from anywhere in the program. Global variables are typically used to store data that needs to be shared across multiple functions or modules.\n\nExample:\n```python\nx = 10  # global variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n\nmy_function()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n**3. Module Scope**\n\nIn a module scope, a variable is defined within a module (a file containing Python code) and is accessible from anywhere within that module. Module variables are typically used to store data that is specific to that module.\n\nExample:\n```python\n# mymodule.py\nx = 10  # module variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n```\n**4. Class Scope**\n\nIn a class scope, a variable is defined within a class and is accessible from anywhere within that class. Class variables are typically used to store data that is shared across all instances of the class.\n\nExample:\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    x = 10  # class variable\n\n    def my_method(self):\n        print(x)  # prints 10\n```\n**5. Instance Scope**\n\nIn an instance scope, a variable is defined within an instance of a class and is accessible only from that instance. Instance variables are typically used to store data that is specific to each instance of the class.\n\nExample:\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 10  # instance variable\n\n    def my_method(self):\n        print(self.x)  # prints 10\n```\n**6. Closure Scope**\n\nIn a closure scope, a variable is defined within a function and is accessible from within any nested functions. Closure variables are typically used to store data that needs to be shared across multiple nested functions.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef outer_function():\n    x = 10  # closure variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        print(x)  # prints 10\n\n    inner_function()\n\nouter_function()\n```\n**7. Lambda Scope**\n\nIn a lambda scope, a variable is defined within a lambda function and is accessible only from within that lambda function. Lambda variables are typically used to store data that is specific to the lambda function.\n\nExample:\n```python\nx = 10  # global variable\n\nlambda_function = lambda: print(x)  # lambda variable\nlambda_function()  # prints 10\n```\nIn summary, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed and how long it lives. Understanding the different scopes of variables is essential for writing effective and efficient code.",
