  "answer": "**Character Counter Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    count = count_char(string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' occurs {count} times in the string '{string}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_char` function takes two arguments: `string` and `char`.\n2. It uses the built-in `count` method of the `string` class to count the occurrences of `char` in `string`.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `count_char` with an example string and character.\n4. The program prints the result to the console.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `char_counter.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python char_counter.py`). You can modify the `string` and `char` variables in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
