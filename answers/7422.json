  "prompt": "Create a function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The function should take one argument, an integer n, and return its factorial. For example, factorial(5) should return 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. You should handle cases where n is less than 0 and raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion, handling cases where the input is less than 0. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input integer for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input integer.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input integer is less than 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input integer is less than 0 and raise a ValueError if true\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input integer must be greater than or equal to 0.\")\n    \n    # Base case: If the input integer is 0 or 1, return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Recursive case: If the input integer is greater than 1, call the function with n-1 and multiply the result by n\n    # This will keep calling the function until it reaches the base case and then start returning the results back up the call stack\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and first checks if it's less than 0. If so, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.\n* The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n* For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`, effectively calculating the factorial through recursive calls.\n* This recursive process continues until it reaches the base case, at which point the results are returned back up the call stack, ultimately giving the factorial of the original input `n`.",
