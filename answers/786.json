  "answer": "Here is a Python program to calculate the distance between two points given their coordinates.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\n    \n    Parameters:\n    x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.\n    y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.\n    x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.\n    y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the distance between the two points\n    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is {distance:.2f} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes the coordinates of two points as input and returns the distance between them.\n2. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n3. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter the coordinates of the two points.\n4. The program then calls the `calculate_distance` function with the user-input coordinates and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two points on a graph.\n* Determine the distance between two locations on a map.\n* Measure the distance between two objects in a 2D space.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the coordinates are given in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.\n* The program uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates.\n* The program rounds the result to two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.",
