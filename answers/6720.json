  "answer": "**Reading from Standard Input and Writing to Standard Output**\n===========================================================\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n    \"\"\"\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        # Remove newline character\n        line = line.strip()\n        # Process the line (in this case, just echo it)\n        processed_line = line\n        # Write to standard output\n        sys.stdout.write(processed_line + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   We use the `sys` module to access standard input (`sys.stdin`) and standard output (`sys.stdout`).\n*   The `main` function reads from standard input line by line using a `for` loop.\n*   Each line is stripped of its newline character using the `strip` method.\n*   You can add your own processing logic to the `processed_line` variable.\n*   Finally, we write the processed line to standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `echo.py`) and then use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython echo.py\n```\n\nType some text and press Enter. The program will echo back what you typed.\n\nAlternatively, you can pipe input to the program:\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello, World!\" | python echo.py\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\n**Note**: This program will continue to read from standard input until it is closed (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+D on Unix-like systems or Ctrl+Z on Windows).",
