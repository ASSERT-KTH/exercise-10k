  "answer": "**Calculating the Area of a Triangle**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is:\n\nArea = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers\")\n\n    area = (base * height) / 2\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the calculated area.\n*   The function checks if the base and height are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_triangle_area` function by taking user input for the base and height, calculating the area, and printing the result.\n*   The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Enter the base of the triangle when prompted (e.g., 5).\n3.  Enter the height of the triangle when prompted (e.g., 6).\n4.  The program will calculate and display the area of the triangle (e.g., 15.00).",
