  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be greater than 0\")\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return perimeter\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate the perimeter\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter:.2f} units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define a function**: The `calculate_perimeter` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.\n2. **Validate input**: The function checks if the length and width are greater than 0, raising a `ValueError` if not.\n3. **Calculate perimeter**: The perimeter is calculated using the formula `2 * (length + width)`.\n4. **Get user input**: In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the length and width of the rectangle.\n5. **Call the function**: The `calculate_perimeter` function is called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n6. **Handle errors**: Any `ValueError` exceptions raised by the `calculate_perimeter` function are caught and printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter `5` for the length and `3` for the width. The output should be `The perimeter of the rectangle is 16.00 units.`\n* Run the program and enter `0` for the length and `3` for the width. The output should be `Length and width must be greater than 0`",
