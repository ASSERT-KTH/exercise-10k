  "answer": "### Rock Paper Scissors Game Function\n\nBelow is a Python function that determines the winner of a Rock Paper Scissors game based on two player choices.\n\n```python\ndef rock_paper_scissors(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner of a Rock Paper Scissors game.\n\n    Args:\n    player1 (str): The choice of the first player. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n    player2 (str): The choice of the second player. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The winner of the game. Can be 'player1', 'player2', or 'tie'.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If either player's choice is not 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the winning conditions\n    winning_conditions = {\n        'rock': 'scissors',\n        'scissors': 'paper',\n        'paper': 'rock'\n    }\n\n    # Check if the inputs are valid\n    valid_choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    if player1 not in valid_choices or player2 not in valid_choices:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid choice. Must be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\")\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    if player1 == player2:\n        return 'tie'\n    elif winning_conditions[player1] == player2:\n        return 'player1'\n    else:\n        return 'player2'\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(rock_paper_scissors('rock', 'scissors'))  # Output: player1\n    print(rock_paper_scissors('scissors', 'paper'))  # Output: player1\n    print(rock_paper_scissors('paper', 'rock'))  # Output: player1\n    print(rock_paper_scissors('rock', 'rock'))  # Output: tie\n    try:\n        print(rock_paper_scissors('invalid', 'rock'))  # Raises ValueError\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function takes two parameters: `player1` and `player2`, which represent the choices of the two players.\n*   It defines a dictionary `winning_conditions` that maps each choice to the choice it beats.\n*   It checks if the inputs are valid by comparing them to a list of valid choices. If either input is invalid, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   It determines the winner by checking if the choices are the same (in which case it's a tie) or if `player1` beats `player2` according to the `winning_conditions` dictionary. If neither condition is met, `player2` must be the winner.\n*   The function returns the winner as a string, which can be `'player1'`, `'player2'`, or `'tie'`.",
