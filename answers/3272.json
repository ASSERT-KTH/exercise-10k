  "answer": "**Minimum Number Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to find the minimum number in a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum number in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n\n    min_number = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num < min_number:\n            min_number = num\n\n    return min_number\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [10, 5, 8, 3, 9, 1]\n    try:\n        min_number = find_minimum(numbers)\n        print(f\"The minimum number in the list is: {min_number}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_minimum` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It initializes the `min_number` variable with the first number in the list.\n4. It iterates over the list of numbers using a for loop.\n5. If a number is found to be less than the current `min_number`, it updates the `min_number`.\n6. Finally, it returns the minimum number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the minimum number in a list of exam scores.\n* Find the minimum temperature in a list of daily temperatures.\n* Find the minimum price in a list of product prices.\n\nNote: This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it needs to iterate over the entire list to find the minimum number.",
