  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a bank account balance is sufficient to make a withdrawal. If the balance is greater than or equal to the withdrawal amount, the program prints 'Withdrawal successful'. If the balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the program prints 'Insufficient balance'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n\n```c\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int balance, amount, total;\n\n    cout << \"Enter your account balance: \";\n    cin >> balance;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the withdrawal amount: \";\n    cin >> amount;\n\n    total = balance - amount;\n\n    if (total >= 0) {\n        cout << \"Withdrawal successful\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Insufficient balance\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, including:\n\n1. Including the necessary iostream library and using the `std` namespace.\n2. Defining the `main` function.\n3. Declaring and initializing three integer variables: `balance`, `amount`, and `total`.\n4. Prompting the user to enter their account balance and reading it into the `balance` variable.\n5. Prompting the user to enter the withdrawal amount and reading it into the `amount` variable.\n6. Calculating the new balance after withdrawal by subtracting `amount` from `balance` and storing it in `total`.\n7. Using an `if` statement to check if the new balance is non-negative (i.e., if the withdrawal is successful).\n8. Printing either \"Withdrawal successful\" or \"Insufficient balance\" depending on the result of the `if` statement.\n9. Returning 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.\n\nNote that I've followed the specification exactly, without adding any additional features or error handling. If you'd like, I can suggest some improvements to make the code more robust or user-friendly.",
