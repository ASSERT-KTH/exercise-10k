  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to identify the maximum value correctly even if it appears multiple times in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that satisfies the given specifications:\n```\ndef max_val(lst):\n    max_val = lst[0]\n    for i in lst:\n        if i > max_val:\n            max_val = i\n    return max_val\n\ndef main():\n    lst = [int(x) for x in input(\"Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: \").split()]\n    print(\"Maximum value in the list:\", max_val(lst))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `max_val` function, which takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a list of integers and then calls the `max_val` function to find the maximum value. The result is printed to the console.",
