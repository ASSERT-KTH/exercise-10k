  "answer": "**Binary Representation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the binary representation of a given integer.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_binary(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the binary representation of a given integer.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The binary representation of the input integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    return bin(n)[2:]\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input integer from the user\n    n = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the binary representation\n    binary = calculate_binary(n)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The binary representation of {n} is: {binary}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_binary` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its binary representation as a string.\n2. The `bin` function is used to convert the integer to its binary representation. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix that `bin` adds to the output.\n3. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter an integer.\n4. The `calculate_binary` function is called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: `10`\n  Output: `The binary representation of 10 is: 1010`\n* Input: `25`\n  Output: `The binary representation of 25 is: 11001`\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis program uses the built-in `bin` function to calculate the binary representation. If you want to implement the calculation manually, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Divide the input integer by 2 and store the remainder.\n2. Repeat step 1 until the quotient is 0.\n3. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders in reverse order.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n```python\ndef calculate_binary_manual(n):\n    binary = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // 2\n    return ''.join(reversed(binary))\n```\nThis implementation is less efficient than the built-in `bin` function but can be useful for educational purposes.",
