  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that asks a series of questions, keeps track of the user's score, and provides feedback on their answers.\n\n```python\n# Define the questions, answers, and scores\nquestions = [\n    {\"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\", \"answer\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"question\": \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\", \"answer\": \"Jupiter\"},\n    {\"question\": \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\", \"answer\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\"},\n    {\"question\": \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\", \"answer\": \"Au\"},\n    {\"question\": \"What is the largest living species of lizard?\", \"answer\": \"Komodo dragon\"}\n]\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Ask each question and check the answer\n    for i, q in enumerate(questions, start=1):\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion {i}: {q['question']}\")\n        user_answer = input(\"Your answer: \")\n\n        # Check if the user's answer matches the correct answer\n        if user_answer.lower() == q[\"answer\"].lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {q['answer']}.\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Define the questions and answers**: The program starts by defining a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a question with its corresponding answer.\n2. **Initialize the score**: The `quiz` function initializes a `score` variable to 0, which will keep track of the number of correct answers.\n3. **Ask each question and check the answer**: The program iterates over the list of questions, prints each question, and asks the user for their answer. It then checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer (case-insensitive). If it does, the program increments the score and prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints a failure message with the correct answer.\n4. **Print the final score**: After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score, which is the number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.\n\n### Example usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you a series of questions, and you can respond with your answers. The program will then provide feedback on your answers and print your final score at the end. For example:\n```\nQuestion 1: What is the capital of France?\nYour answer: Paris\nCorrect!\n\nQuestion 2: What is the largest planet in our solar system?\nYour answer: Earth\nSorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was Jupiter.\n\n...\n\nQuiz complete! Your final score is 3 out of 5\n```",
