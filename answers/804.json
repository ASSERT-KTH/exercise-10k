  "answer": "**Boolean Variable Control Flow Example**\n======================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that uses a boolean variable to control the flow of the program and print a message based on its value.\n\n```python\ndef print_message(boolean_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a message based on the value of the boolean variable.\n\n    Args:\n        boolean_variable (bool): The boolean variable that controls the message.\n    \"\"\"\n    if boolean_variable:\n        print(\"The boolean variable is True.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The boolean variable is False.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Set the boolean variable to True\n    boolean_variable = True\n    print_message(boolean_variable)\n\n    # Set the boolean variable to False\n    boolean_variable = False\n    print_message(boolean_variable)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `print_message` function takes a boolean variable as an argument.\n2. Inside the `print_message` function, an `if-else` statement checks the value of the boolean variable.\n3. If the boolean variable is `True`, it prints \"The boolean variable is True.\".\n4. If the boolean variable is `False`, it prints \"The boolean variable is False.\".\n5. In the `main` function, we set the boolean variable to `True` and `False` and call the `print_message` function to demonstrate the control flow.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nWhen you run this program, you should see the following output:\n\n```\nThe boolean variable is True.\nThe boolean variable is False.\n```",
