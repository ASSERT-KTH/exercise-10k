  "answer": "### Creating a New Dictionary\n\nYou can create a new dictionary in Python with specified keys and values using the following methods:\n\n#### Method 1: Using Dictionary Literal\n\n```python\n# Create a new dictionary with specified keys and values\nnew_dict = {\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n    \"key2\": \"value2\",\n    \"key3\": \"value3\"\n}\n\nprint(new_dict)\n```\n\n#### Method 2: Using Dictionary Constructor\n\n```python\n# Create a new dictionary with specified keys and values\nnew_dict = dict([\n    (\"key1\", \"value1\"),\n    (\"key2\", \"value2\"),\n    (\"key3\", \"value3\")\n])\n\nprint(new_dict)\n```\n\n#### Method 3: Using zip() Function\n\n```python\n# Define keys and values as separate lists\nkeys = [\"key1\", \"key2\", \"key3\"]\nvalues = [\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\"]\n\n# Create a new dictionary with specified keys and values\nnew_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))\n\nprint(new_dict)\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose you want to store information about books in a dictionary, where each key represents a book title and the value represents the author.\n\n```python\n# Create a new dictionary with book titles as keys and authors as values\nbooks = {\n    \"To Kill a Mockingbird\": \"Harper Lee\",\n    \"1984\": \"George Orwell\",\n    \"Pride and Prejudice\": \"Jane Austen\"\n}\n\n# Access a book's author by its title\nprint(books[\"To Kill a Mockingbird\"])  # Output: Harper Lee\n```\n\nIn this example, the dictionary `books` is created with book titles as keys and authors as values. You can then access a book's author by its title using the dictionary's key-value lookup.",
