  "answer": "### Anagram Detection Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following Python function checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if sorted versions of both strings are equal\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # Expected output: True\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # Expected output: False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `are_anagrams` takes two strings as input, `str1` and `str2`.\n2. It removes any whitespace from the input strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores spaces.\n3. It then sorts the characters in each string and checks if the sorted strings are equal.\n4. If the sorted strings are equal, it means the original strings are anagrams of each other, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote: This function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings. For very large strings, a more efficient approach might be to use a counter or dictionary to compare the frequency of characters in each string, which would have a linear time complexity of O(n).",
