  "answer": "**Time Conversion Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a time in hours as input and returns its equivalent in minutes.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef hours_to_minutes(hours):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert hours to minutes.\n\n    Args:\n        hours (float): Time in hours.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Time in minutes.\n    \"\"\"\n    minutes = hours * 60\n    return minutes\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    hours = float(input(\"Enter time in hours: \"))\n\n    # Convert hours to minutes\n    minutes = hours_to_minutes(hours)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"{hours} hour(s) is equal to {minutes} minute(s)\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a time in hours when prompted (e.g., 2.5).\n3. The program will output the equivalent time in minutes (e.g., 150.0).\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `hours_to_minutes` function takes a time in hours as input and multiplies it by 60 to convert it to minutes.\n2. The `main` function gets user input, calls the `hours_to_minutes` function, and prints the result.",
