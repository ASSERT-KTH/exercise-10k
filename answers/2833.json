  "answer": "**Student Grade Prediction Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program predicts a student's grade based on their attendance and marks. It uses a simple grading system where the grade is determined by the attendance and marks.\n\n### Grading System\n\n* Grade A: Attendance above 90% and marks above 80\n* Grade B: Attendance between 80% and 90% and marks between 70 and 80\n* Default Grade: C (if the above conditions are not met)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef predict_grade(attendance, marks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts a student's grade based on their attendance and marks.\n\n    Args:\n        attendance (float): Student's attendance percentage\n        marks (float): Student's marks percentage\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Predicted grade\n    \"\"\"\n    if attendance > 90 and marks > 80:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif 80 <= attendance <= 90 and 70 <= marks <= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    else:\n        return \"C\"\n\ndef main():\n    attendance = float(input(\"Enter student's attendance percentage: \"))\n    marks = float(input(\"Enter student's marks percentage: \"))\n\n    grade = predict_grade(attendance, marks)\n    print(f\"Predicted grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Student with 95% attendance and 85% marks: Predicted grade A\n* Student with 85% attendance and 75% marks: Predicted grade B\n* Student with 70% attendance and 60% marks: Predicted grade C\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `student_grade.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python: `python student_grade.py`.\n3. Enter the student's attendance and marks percentages when prompted.\n4. The program will display the predicted grade.",
