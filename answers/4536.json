  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input and returns two lists: one containing the elements that satisfy the condition and one containing the elements that do not satisfy the condition.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that the specifications describe:\n\n```python\ndef partition(lst, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition a list into two lists based on a condition.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the elements that satisfy the condition,\n            and the second list contains the elements that do not satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    true_list = [item for item in lst if condition(item)]\n    false_list = [item for item in lst if not condition(item)]\n    return true_list, false_list\n\n# Example usage:\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven_numbers, odd_numbers = partition(numbers, is_even)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `partition` that takes a list and a condition as input, partitions the list into two lists based on the condition, and returns the two lists as a tuple. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `partition` function to partition a list of numbers into even and odd numbers.",
