  "answer": "**Number Guessing Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that thinks of a random number between 1 and 10, and then asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's guess and converts it to an integer.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            return int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\ndef check_guess(guess, target):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the user's guess is correct, higher, or lower than the target number.\"\"\"\n    if guess < target:\n        return \"Your guess is too low. Try again!\"\n    elif guess > target:\n        return \"Your guess is too high. Try again!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly.\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    target_number = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Get the user's guess\n        user_guess = get_user_guess()\n        \n        # Check if the guess is within the valid range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check the guess\n        result = check_guess(user_guess, target_number)\n        print(result)\n        \n        # If the guess is correct, exit the loop\n        if \"Congratulations\" in result:\n            print(f\"You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 10 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 10.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.",
