  "answer": "**Tic-Tac-Toe Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program allows a user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. The computer's moves are chosen randomly.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Make a random move for the computer.\"\"\"\n    available_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    return random.choice(available_moves)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main game loop.\"\"\"\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move_index = computer_move(board)\n        board[computer_move_index] = \"O\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The current state of the board will be printed.\n3. Enter your move by typing a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the space where you'd like to place your piece.\n4. The computer will make a random move.\n5. Steps 2-4 will repeat until there is a winner or a tie.\n\nNote: The board is numbered as follows:\n```\n1 | 2 | 3\n---+---+---\n4 | 5 | 6\n---+---+---\n7 | 8 | 9\n```",
