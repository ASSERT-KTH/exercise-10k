  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice and determine the winner based on the user's input.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, here is the code that meets the requirements:\n```\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    user = input(\"Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissor): \").lower()\n    while user not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissor\"]:\n        user = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissor: \").lower()\n\n    possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissor\"]\n    computer = random.choice(possible_choices)\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user}, computer chose {computer}.\\n\")\n\n    if user == computer:\n        print(f\"Both players selected {user}. It's a tie!\")\n    elif user == \"rock\":\n        if computer == \"scissor\":\n            print(\"Rock smashes scissor! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n    elif user == \"paper\":\n        if computer == \"rock\":\n            print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Scissor cuts paper! You lose.\")\n    elif user == \"scissor\":\n        if computer == \"paper\":\n            print(\"Scissor cuts paper! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Rock smashes scissor! You lose.\")\n\ngame()\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including:\n\n1. Importing the `random` module.\n2. Defining a `game` function that takes no arguments.\n3. Getting user input and validating it.\n4. Generating a random computer choice.\n5. Printing the user's and computer's choices.\n6. Determining the winner based on the game's rules.\n7. Printing the result of the game.\n8. Calling the `game` function to start the game.\n\nNote that I added a `while` loop to handle invalid user input, as specified in the requirements. This ensures that the user is prompted to re-enter their choice until they enter a valid one.",
