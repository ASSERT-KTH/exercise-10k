Run the program.\n2. Enter a noun when prompted (e.g., \"princess\").\n3. Enter a place when prompted (e.g., \"castle\").\n4. Enter a verb when prompted (e.g., \"dance\").\n5. Enter a place when prompted (e.g., \"garden\").\n6. The program will print the completed story.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n* You can modify the `get_word_type` function to ask for different types of words based on the index.\n* You can add more complexity to the story by using multiple blank spaces with different word types.\n* You can use a dictionary to store the word types and their corresponding prompts.\n* You can use a loop to ask the user to fill in the blanks multiple times and store the completed stories in a list.",
