  "answer": "**Student Greeting Program**\n================================\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Declare variables to store a student's name and age\n    student_name = \"John Doe\"\n    student_age = 20\n\n    # Print out a greeting message that includes the name and age\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {student_name} and I am {student_age} years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a `main` function to encapsulate our program's logic.\n2. Inside `main`, we declare two variables: `student_name` and `student_age`.\n3. We use an f-string to format a greeting message that includes the student's name and age.\n4. Finally, we call the `main` function when the script is run directly.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `student_greeting.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python student_greeting.py`). The output should be:\n```\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.\n```",
