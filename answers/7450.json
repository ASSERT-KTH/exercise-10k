  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The program should iterate over the array, comparing each element to the current maximum value, and update the maximum value if a larger element is found.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> myVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n\n    int max = myVector[0];\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < myVector.size(); i++) {\n        if (myVector[i] > max) {\n            max = myVector[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"The maximum value is: \" << max << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI hope this meets the requirements! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",
