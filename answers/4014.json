  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a while loop to sum the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the sum and the counter\ntotal_sum = 0\ni = 1\n\n# Use a while loop to sum the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10\nwhile i <= 10:\n    # Add the square of the current number to the sum\n    total_sum += i ** 2\n    # Increment the counter\n    i += 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", total_sum)\n```\n\nThis program will output:\n```\nThe sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is: 385\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We first initialize two variables: `total_sum` to store the sum of the squares and `i` to act as a counter.\n2. We then use a while loop to iterate over all the numbers from 1 to 10.\n3. Inside the loop, we add the square of the current number (`i ** 2`) to `total_sum`.\n4. After each iteration, we increment the counter `i` by 1.\n5. Once the loop finishes, we print out the final sum.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use a for loop to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ntotal_sum = 0\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    total_sum += i ** 2\nprint(\"The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", total_sum)\n```\n\nOr, you can use a more Pythonic way using the built-in `sum` function and a generator expression:\n\n```python\ntotal_sum = sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11))\nprint(\"The sum of the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", total_sum)\n```",
