  "answer": "**Perfect Square Checker using While Loop**\n\n### Description\n\nThis code checks if a given number is a perfect square using a while loop. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares because they can be expressed as 2^2, 3^2, and 4^2 respectively.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if i * i == n:\n            return True\n        i += 1\n    return False\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_perfect_square(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a perfect square.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a perfect square.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_perfect_square` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. We start with `i = 1` and increment it in each iteration of the while loop.\n3. Inside the loop, we check if `i * i` is equal to `n`. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that `n` is a perfect square.\n4. If `i * i` exceeds `n`, we return `False`, indicating that `n` is not a perfect square.\n5. In the `main` function, we take a number as input from the user and call the `is_perfect_square` function to check if it's a perfect square.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because we iterate up to the square root of n in the while loop.",
