  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a list of all email addresses found in the string.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a regular expression to find all email addresses in a given string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_emails(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all email addresses in the given text.\n\n    Args:\n    text (str): The text to search for email addresses.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of email addresses found in the text.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Regular expression for matching most common email address formats\n    email_regex = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n\n    # Find all matches of the regular expression in the text\n    emails = re.findall(email_regex, text)\n\n    return emails\n\n\n# Test the function\ntext = \"You can contact me at john.doe@example.com or jane.doe@example.org for more information.\"\nprint(find_emails(text))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1.  It defines a function `find_emails` that takes a string `text` as input.\n2.  The function uses a regular expression `email_regex` to match most common email address formats. The regular expression breaks down as follows:\n    *   `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens. This matches the local part of the email address (before the `@` symbol).\n    *   `@` matches the `@` symbol literally.\n    *   `[A-Za-z0-9.-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens. This matches the domain name.\n    *   `\\.` matches a dot (.) literally.\n    *   `[A-Z|a-z]{2,}` matches the domain extension (it must be at least 2 characters long).\n3.  The `re.findall` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the input text.\n4.  Finally, the function returns a list of email addresses found in the text.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided example or with your own text.",
