  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. If the grade is above 50, the student passes. Otherwise, the student fails. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (float): The student's grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The outcome of the student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade >= 50:\n        return \"Pass\"\n    else:\n        return \"Fail\"\n\n# Test the function\ngrade = float(input(\"Enter the student's grade: \"))\nprint(f\"The student has {check_grade(grade)}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_grade` function takes one argument: `grade`, which is the student's grade.\n*   Inside the function, an `if` statement checks if the `grade` is greater than or equal to 50.\n*   If the condition is met, the function returns \"Pass\". Otherwise, it returns \"Fail\".\n*   The program then prompts the user to enter a grade, calls the `check_grade` function with the provided grade, and prints the outcome.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Passing grade**: Enter a grade of 60 when prompted, and the program will output \"The student has Pass.\"\n*   **Failing grade**: Enter a grade of 40 when prompted, and the program will output \"The student has Fail.\"",
