  "answer": "**Haiku Generator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a haiku poem with a given number of syllables using a for loop. A traditional haiku consists of three lines with a syllable count of 5, 7, and 5.\n\n### Program Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words with their corresponding syllable counts\nwords = {\n    \"sun\": 1,\n    \"moon\": 1,\n    \"sky\": 1,\n    \"river\": 2,\n    \"mountain\": 2,\n    \"flower\": 2,\n    \"beautiful\": 3,\n    \"serene\": 2,\n    \"peaceful\": 2,\n    \"nature\": 2,\n    \"calm\": 1,\n    \"gentle\": 2,\n    \"breeze\": 1,\n    \"sunset\": 2,\n    \"dawn\": 1,\n    \"night\": 1,\n    \"stars\": 1,\n    \"twinkling\": 2,\n    \"shining\": 2,\n}\n\ndef generate_haiku(syllable_counts):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a haiku poem with the given syllable counts.\n\n    Args:\n    syllable_counts (list): A list of syllable counts for each line of the haiku.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The generated haiku poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    haiku = []\n    for syllable_count in syllable_counts:\n        line = []\n        remaining_syllables = syllable_count\n        while remaining_syllables > 0:\n            word = random.choice(list(words.keys()))\n            if words[word] <= remaining_syllables:\n                line.append(word)\n                remaining_syllables -= words[word]\n        haiku.append(\" \".join(line))\n    return \"\\n\".join(haiku)\n\n# Example usage\nsyllable_counts = [5, 7, 5]\nprint(generate_haiku(syllable_counts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program starts by defining a dictionary `words` that maps words to their corresponding syllable counts.\n2. The `generate_haiku` function takes a list of syllable counts as input and generates a haiku poem.\n3. For each syllable count, the function uses a for loop to select words from the `words` dictionary until the remaining syllable count reaches zero.\n4. The selected words are appended to a list `line`, and the remaining syllable count is updated.\n5. Once all lines have been generated, the function returns the haiku poem as a string.\n6. In the example usage, the program generates a haiku poem with a syllable count of 5, 7, and 5, and prints the result.\n\nNote that this program generates haiku poems randomly, so the output will vary each time the program is run. You can modify the `words` dictionary to include more words and syllable counts to improve the quality of the generated haiku poems.",
