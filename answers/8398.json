  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the account type (checking or savings) and the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal). Based on the account type and transaction type, the program should then ask for the amount and apply the transaction. If the account type is checking and the transaction type is withdrawal, the program should check if the amount is greater than $1000. If it is, the program should charge a $5 fee. If the account type is savings and the transaction type is withdrawal, the program should check if the amount is greater than $500. If it is, the program should charge a $3 fee. The program should then display the new balance after the transaction.",

A $5 fee was charged. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n            elif self.account_type == \"savings\" and amount > 500:\n                self.balance -= 3\n                print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}.

The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods apply the corresponding transactions to the account. The `main` function guides the user through the transaction process, asking for the account type, transaction type, and amount. It then applies the transaction and displays the new balance.",
