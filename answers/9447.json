  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding operation.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to be used. It can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of the four basic arithmetic operators.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and the second number is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Only '+', '-', '*', and '/' are allowed.\")\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n        operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        result = calculator(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The `calculator` function takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator as input.\n2.  It then checks the operator and performs the corresponding operation.\n3.  If the operator is '/', it checks if the second number is 0 to avoid division by zero errors.\n4.  If the operator is not one of the four basic arithmetic operators, it raises a `ValueError`.\n5.  The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `calculator` function, and prints the result.\n6.  It also catches any `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError` that may be raised and prints an error message.",
