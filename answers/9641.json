  "answer": "**CSV Reader and Writer Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following Python function utilizes the `csv` module to read and write CSV files.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef read_csv_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a CSV file and returns its contents as a list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the CSV file.\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n        return list(csv_reader)\n\ndef write_csv_file(file_path, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes data to a CSV file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.\n        data (list): A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the CSV file.\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as file:\n        csv_writer = csv.writer(file)\n        csv_writer.writerows(data)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Read a CSV file\n    file_path = 'example.csv'\n    data = read_csv_file(file_path)\n    print(\"Read Data:\")\n    for row in data:\n        print(row)\n\n    # Write to a CSV file\n    new_file_path = 'new_example.csv'\n    new_data = [\n        ['Name', 'Age'],\n        ['John', '25'],\n        ['Alice', '30']\n    ]\n    write_csv_file(new_file_path, new_data)\n    print(\"\\nWrote to\", new_file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `read_csv_file` function opens the specified CSV file, creates a `csv.reader` object, and returns the file's contents as a list of lists.\n*   The `write_csv_file` function opens the specified CSV file, creates a `csv.writer` object, and writes the provided data to the file.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to read from a CSV file and write to a new CSV file.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   Make sure to replace `'example.csv'` and `'new_example.csv'` with the actual paths to your CSV files.\n*   The `csv` module is part of the Python Standard Library, so you don't need to install any additional packages to use it.",
