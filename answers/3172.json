  "answer": "### Anagram Checker Function\n#### Overview\nThis function checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. It does this by sorting the characters in each string and comparing the results.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n    str1 (str): The first string.\n    str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if sorted versions of the strings are equal\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # True\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `are_anagrams` takes two strings as input.\n2. It removes any whitespace from the strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It sorts the characters in each string and checks if the sorted strings are equal.\n4. If the sorted strings are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input strings are anagrams of each other. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `sorted` function in Python uses a sorting algorithm called Timsort, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). For large input strings, a more efficient solution might be needed.",
