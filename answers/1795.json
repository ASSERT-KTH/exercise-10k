  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function to find the difference between two dictionaries and return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in the first dictionary but not in the second dictionary. This function will enable you to compare and extract unique key-value pairs from two dictionaries efficiently. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef dict_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the difference between two dictionaries.\n    \n    It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in the first dictionary but not in the second dictionary.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the difference\n    diff_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the first dictionary\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # Check if the key is not present in the second dictionary or its value is different\n        if key not in dict2 or value != dict2[key]:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the difference dictionary\n            diff_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the difference dictionary\n    return diff_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\nprint(dict_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `dict_difference` initializes an empty dictionary `diff_dict` to store the key-value pairs that exist in `dict1` but not in `dict2`.\n* It iterates over each key-value pair in `dict1` using a for loop and checks if the key is not present in `dict2` or its value is different. If the condition is met, it adds the key-value pair to `diff_dict`.\n* The function returns `diff_dict`, which contains the key-value pairs that exist in `dict1` but not in `dict2`.\n* In the example usage, `dict1` and `dict2` are compared, and the output is `{'a': 1, 'c': 3}`, which are the key-value pairs that exist in `dict1` but not in `dict2`.",
