  "answer": "**Calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python solution that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for two numbers\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the GCD\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\n    # Alternatively, use the math.gcd function (available in Python 3.5 and later)\n    gcd_builtin = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} (using math.gcd) is: {gcd_builtin}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the script.\n2. Enter the first number when prompted (e.g., 48).\n3. Enter the second number when prompted (e.g., 18).\n4. The script will print the GCD of the two numbers.\n\nNote: The `math.gcd` function is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version, you can use the `calculate_gcd` function instead.",
