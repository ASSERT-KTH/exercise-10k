  "answer": "**Calculating Student Average Grade**\n\nTo calculate a student's average grade, we'll need to collect their scores in three subjects. Below is a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade():\n    # Get the student's scores in three subjects\n    subject1_score = float(input(\"Enter score in Subject 1: \"))\n    subject2_score = float(input(\"Enter score in Subject 2: \"))\n    subject3_score = float(input(\"Enter score in Subject 3: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = (subject1_score + subject2_score + subject3_score) / 3\n\n    # Print the average grade\n    print(f\"The student's average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_average_grade()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_average_grade()` that prompts the user for scores in three subjects.\n2. It calculates the average grade by summing the scores and dividing by the number of subjects (3).\n3. The average grade is then printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter scores for three subjects. After entering the scores, it will print the student's average grade.\n\n```\nEnter score in Subject 1: 85\nEnter score in Subject 2: 90\nEnter score in Subject 3: 78\nThe student's average grade is: 84.33\n```",
