  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) as input, and then performs the specified operation on the two numbers. The program should handle invalid operations and division by zero.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specification:\n```\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    op = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Define operations\n    def add(x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n    def sub(x, y):\n        return x - y\n\n    def mul(x, y):\n        return x * y\n\n    def div(x, y):\n        if y == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n            sys.exit()\n        return x / y\n\n    # Map operations to functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': add,\n        '-': sub,\n        '*': mul,\n        '/': div\n    }\n\n    # Check if operation is valid\n    if op not in operations:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation\")\n        sys.exit()\n\n    # Perform operation and print result\n    result = operations[op](num1, num2)\n    print(\"Result:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've followed the specification carefully and implemented the code as described. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
