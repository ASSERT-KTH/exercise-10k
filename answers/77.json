  "answer": "**String Rotation Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program checks if a given string is a rotation of another string. A rotation of a string is a string that can be obtained by rotating the characters of the original string.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef is_rotation(s1, s2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if s2 is a rotation of s1.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The original string.\n        s2 (str): The string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s2 is a rotation of s1, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    return s2 in s1 + s1\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    s1 = \"abcde\"\n    s2 = \"cdeab\"\n    s3 = \"abced\"\n\n    print(f\"Is '{s2}' a rotation of '{s1}'? {is_rotation(s1, s2)}\")\n    print(f\"Is '{s3}' a rotation of '{s1}'? {is_rotation(s1, s3)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `is_rotation` function takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.\n2. It first checks if the lengths of `s1` and `s2` are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`, as a rotation of a string must have the same length.\n3. If the lengths are equal, it checks if `s2` is a substring of `s1 + s1`. This is because a rotation of `s1` can be obtained by taking a substring of `s1 + s1` that has the same length as `s1`.\n4. The `main` function provides example usage of the `is_rotation` function.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nIs 'cdeab' a rotation of 'abcde'? True\nIs 'abced' a rotation of 'abcde'? False\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-----------------\n\nThe time complexity of the `is_rotation` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `in` operator in Python has a time complexity of O(n) for strings.",
