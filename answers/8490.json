  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer grade score as input and outputs a letter grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Program Description\n# This program converts an integer score into a letter grade.\n# It uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n\n# Get the Score\nscore = int(input(\"Enter a score: \"))\n\n# Determine the Grade\nif score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n    grade = \"A\"\nelif score >= 80 and score < 90:\n    grade = \"B\"\nelif score >= 70 and score < 80:\n    grade = \"C\"\nelif score >= 60 and score < 70:\n    grade = \"D\"\nelif score < 60:\n    grade = \"F\"\n\n# Print the Grade\nprint(\"Grade: \" + grade)\n```\nI've followed the specification to the letter, including the comments and the exact logic for determining the grade. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything!",
