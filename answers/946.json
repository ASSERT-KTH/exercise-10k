  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop:\n\n```python\n# Initialize variables\ni = 1\nsum_of_squares = 0\n\n# Loop through numbers from 1 to 10\nwhile i <= 10:\n    # Calculate the square of the current number and add it to the sum\n    sum_of_squares += i ** 2\n    # Move to the next number\n    i += 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", sum_of_squares)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop and print the result. \n\nHere is how it works:\n\n- We start with `i = 1` and `sum_of_squares = 0`.\n- We then enter a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.\n- Inside the loop, we calculate the square of the current number `i` using `i ** 2`, and add it to `sum_of_squares`.\n- We then increment `i` by 1 using `i += 1`, so that we move to the next number in the next iteration of the loop.\n- Once the loop finishes (i.e., when `i` exceeds 10), we print the final value of `sum_of_squares`, which is the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.",
