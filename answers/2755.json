  "answer": "**Mortgage Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the monthly payment for a mortgage given the principal, rate, and term.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mortgage_payment(principal, rate, term):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly payment for a mortgage.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount borrowed.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        term (int): The number of years to repay the mortgage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    monthly_rate = rate / 12\n    number_of_payments = term * 12\n    monthly_payment = principal * monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate) ** number_of_payments / ((1 + monthly_rate) ** number_of_payments - 1)\n    return monthly_payment\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    term = int(input(\"Enter the term of the mortgage (in years): \"))\n\n    monthly_payment = calculate_mortgage_payment(principal, rate, term)\n    print(f\"The monthly payment is: ${monthly_payment:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses the formula for calculating the monthly payment for a mortgage, which is:\n\nM = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n \u2013 1]\n\nWhere:\n- M = monthly payment\n- P = principal amount\n- r = monthly interest rate\n- n = number of payments\n\nThe program first calculates the monthly interest rate and the number of payments, then uses these values to calculate the monthly payment.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, and term of the mortgage when prompted. The program will then calculate and display the monthly payment amount.\n\nFor example, if you enter:\n\n* Principal amount: $200,000\n* Annual interest rate: 4.5%\n* Term: 30 years\n\nThe program will output:\n\n* The monthly payment is: $1,013.37",
