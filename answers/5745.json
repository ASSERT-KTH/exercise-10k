  "answer": "### Boolean Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nHere is an example code snippet in Python that declares a boolean variable and prints its value:\n\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable\nis_true = True\n\n# Print the value of the boolean variable\nprint(is_true)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `True`\n\nYou can also declare the boolean variable with a value of `False`:\n\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable\nis_false = False\n\n# Print the value of the boolean variable\nprint(is_false)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `False`\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We use the `True` and `False` keywords to assign boolean values to the variables.\n* The `print()` function is used to output the value of the boolean variable to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Boolean variables can be used in conditional statements, such as `if` and `else`, to control the flow of a program.\n* Boolean variables can be used to represent the state of a flag or a toggle, where `True` represents \"on\" and `False` represents \"off\".",
