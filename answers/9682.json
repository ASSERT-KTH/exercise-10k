  "prompt": "Create a function called fusion that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that combines their functionality. The new function should apply the first function to the input and then apply the second function to the result.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines the functionality of two input functions, helping you understand how to apply this concept in your own code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called fusion that takes two functions as arguments.\ndef fusion(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines the functionality of two input functions.\n    \n    It takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function. \n    The new function applies the first input function to the input and then applies the second input function to the result.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function to be applied.\n        func2 (function): The second function to be applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that combines the functionality of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a new function inside the fusion function. This new function will be returned by fusion.\n    def combined_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # Apply the first function to the input and store the result.\n        result = func1(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Apply the second function to the result and return the final result.\n        return func2(result)\n\n    # Return the new combined function.\n    return combined_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ndef increment(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ncombined = fusion(double, increment)\nprint(combined(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `fusion` function takes two input functions `func1` and `func2` and returns a new function `combined_function`. This new function applies `func1` to the input, then applies `func2` to the result.\n* Inside `combined_function`, the input is passed to `func1` using `*args` and `**kwargs` to handle any number of arguments, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.\n* The `result` is then passed to `func2`, and the final result is returned by `combined_function`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `fusion` function to combine two simple functions `double` and `increment`, and applies the resulting combined function to an input value.",
