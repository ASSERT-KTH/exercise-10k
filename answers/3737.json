  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a range of numbers as input, calculates the Fibonacci numbers within that range, and prints them out.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the function fibonachi\ndef fibonachi(start, end):\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= end:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return [num for num in fib_sequence if start <= num <= end]\n\n# Define the function main\ndef main():\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the start of the range: \"))\n    end = int(input(\"Enter the end of the range: \"))\n    result = fibonachi(start, end)\n    print(\"Fibonacci numbers in the range:\", result)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined in the problem description. It defines the `fibonachi` function to calculate Fibonacci numbers within a given range, and the `main` function to take user input and print the result. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.",
