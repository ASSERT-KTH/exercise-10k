  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs basic vector operations:\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, components):\n        self.components = components\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Vector({self.components})\"\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        if len(self.components) != len(other.components):\n            raise ValueError(\"Both vectors must have the same number of components\")\n        return Vector([x + y for x, y in zip(self.components, other.components)])\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        if len(self.components) != len(other.components):\n            raise ValueError(\"Both vectors must have the same number of components\")\n        return Vector([x - y for x, y in zip(self.components, other.components)])\n\n    def __mul__(self, scalar):\n        return Vector([x * scalar for x in self.components])\n\n    def __rmul__(self, scalar):\n        return self * scalar\n\n    def __truediv__(self, scalar):\n        if scalar == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return Vector([x / scalar for x in self.components])\n\n# Example usage:\nv1 = Vector([1, 2, 3])\nv2 = Vector([4, 5, 6])\n\nprint(\"Vector 1:\", v1)\nprint(\"Vector 2:\", v2)\n\nv_add = v1 + v2\nprint(\"Vector 1 + Vector 2:\", v_add)\n\nv_sub = v1 - v2\nprint(\"Vector 1 - Vector 2:\", v_sub)\n\nv_scalar_mul = v1 * 2\nprint(\"Vector 1 * 2:\", v_scalar_mul)\n\nv_scalar_div = v1 / 2\nprint(\"Vector 1 / 2:\", v_scalar_div)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We create a class called `Vector` with methods for addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and scalar division.\n- The `__init__` method initializes the vector with a list of components.\n- The `__add__` and `__sub__` methods check if both vectors have the same number of components before performing addition or subtraction.\n- The `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods perform scalar multiplication.\n- The `__truediv__` method performs scalar division and raises an error if the scalar is zero.\n- The example usage demonstrates how to create vectors and perform operations on them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Define the `Vector` class**: Create a class called `Vector` to represent vectors.\n2. **Implement `__init__` method**: Initialize the vector with a list of components.\n3. **Implement `__add__` and `__sub__` methods**: Check if both vectors have the same number of components before performing addition or subtraction.\n4. **Implement `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods**: Perform scalar multiplication.\n5. **Implement `__truediv__` method**: Perform scalar division and raise an error if the scalar is zero.\n6. **Create example vectors**: Create instances of the `Vector` class to demonstrate the usage of the methods.\n7. **Perform vector operations**: Use the methods to perform addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and scalar division on the example vectors.",
