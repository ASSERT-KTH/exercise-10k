  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean of the numbers\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the variance of the numbers\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n    return std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n    print(f\"The standard deviation of {numbers} is {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It calculates the mean of the numbers by summing them up and dividing by the total count.\n3. It calculates the variance of the numbers by summing up the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the total count.\n4. It calculates the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_standard_deviation` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses the population standard deviation formula, which is suitable when you have the entire population of data. If you're working with a sample of data, you should use the sample standard deviation formula, which divides by `n-1` instead of `n` when calculating the variance.",
