The `is_valid` function checks if it's possible to place a number in a given position on the board. It checks the row, column, and 3x3 box to ensure the number doesn't already exist.\n2. The `solve_sudoku` function uses backtracking to solve the puzzle. It iterates through the board, and for each empty cell, it tries to place numbers from 1 to 9. If a number is valid, it recursively calls `solve_sudoku` to fill in the rest of the board. If it can't find a valid number, it backtracks and tries a different number.\n3. The `print_board` function prints the Sudoku board in a formatted way, with lines separating the 3x",
