  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"Answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n        \"C\": \"Pablo Picasso\",\n        \"D\": \"Claude Monet\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz_program():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the questions\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"Answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"Answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {options['Answer']}.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\n# Run the quiz program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz_program()\n```\n\n**How to Use the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by entering the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n4. After answering all questions, the program will display your final score.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, you will see the first question:\n```\nWhat is the capital of France?\nA: Berlin\nB: Paris\nC: London\nD: Rome\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D):\n```\nEnter your answer, and the program will respond accordingly. Repeat this process for each question.",
