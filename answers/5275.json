  "answer": "**Time Conversion Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes time in 12-hour format as input and converts it to 24-hour format using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_24_hour_format(time_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format.\n    \n    Args:\n        time_str (str): Time in 12-hour format (e.g., \"08:30 PM\")\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: Time in 24-hour format (e.g., \"20:30\")\n    \"\"\"\n    time_str = time_str.upper()  # Convert to uppercase for simplicity\n    components = time_str.split()  # Split time and AM/PM\n    \n    time = components[0].split(\":\")  # Split hours and minutes\n    hours = int(time[0])\n    minutes = time[1]\n    \n    if components[1] == \"PM\" and hours != 12:\n        # Add 12 to hours if PM and not 12\n        hours += 12\n    elif components[1] == \"AM\" and hours == 12:\n        # Set hours to 0 if AM and 12\n        hours = 0\n    \n    # Format the time as a string\n    time_str = \"{:02d}:{:02d}\".format(hours, minutes)\n    \n    return time_str\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    time_str = input(\"Enter time in 12-hour format (e.g., 08:30 PM): \")\n    print(\"Time in 24-hour format:\", convert_to_24_hour_format(time_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `08:30 PM`\n  Output: `20:30`\n* Input: `08:30 AM`\n  Output: `08:30`\n* Input: `12:00 PM`\n  Output: `12:00`\n* Input: `12:00 AM`\n  Output: `00:00`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program takes time in 12-hour format as input from the user.\n2. It splits the input string into time and AM/PM components.\n3. It further splits the time component into hours and minutes.\n4. Based on the AM/PM component, it applies the following rules:\n   * If PM and hours are not 12, add 12 to hours.\n   * If AM and hours are 12, set hours to 0.\n5. Finally, it formats the time as a string in 24-hour format and prints the result.",
