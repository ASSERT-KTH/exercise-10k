It creates a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the first `i` characters of `seq1` and the first `j` characters of `seq2`.\n\nThe program then fills the `dp` table using a while loop, comparing characters from `seq1` and `seq2` and updating the `dp` table accordingly.\n\nFinally, the program backtracks through the `dp` table to find the longest common subsequence and returns it as a string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n--------------------\n\nThe space complexity of the program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.",
