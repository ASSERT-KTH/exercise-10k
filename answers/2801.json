  "prompt": "Write a program to print 'Hello, World!' to the console.",
  "answer": "**Hello World Program**\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `main` function is defined to contain the program's entry point.\n2. The `print` function is used to output the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\n1. Save this code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the file.\n4. Run the program using the command `python hello.py`.\n5. The output \"Hello, World!\" should appear in the console.",
