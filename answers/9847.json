  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), score >= 80 and score < 90 (B), score >= 70 and score < 80 (C), score >= 60 and score < 70 (D), score < 60 (F). The program should use conditional statements (if/else) to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int score;\n\n    cout << \"Enter a score: \";\n    cin >> score;\n\n    if (score >= 90) {\n        cout << \"Grade: A\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 80) {\n        cout << \"Grade: B\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 70) {\n        cout << \"Grade: C\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 60) {\n        cout << \"Grade: D\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Grade: F\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
