  "answer": "**Intersection of Two Arrays**\n================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven two arrays, find the common elements between them.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python function that uses the built-in `set` data structure to find the intersection of two arrays:\n\n```python\ndef array_intersection(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the intersection of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(array_intersection(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Convert the input arrays to sets using the `set()` function.\n2. Use the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets.\n3. Convert the resulting set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because the `set()` function has a time complexity of O(n), and the `&` operator has a time complexity of O(min(n, m)).\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because the `set()` function creates a new set with the same number of elements as the input array.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nIf you need to preserve the original order of the elements, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef array_intersection_ordered(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the intersection of two arrays, preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of the two arrays, in the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in arr1 if x in arr2]\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(array_intersection_ordered(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nThis solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the first array, and checks if each element is present in the second array using the `in` operator. If an element is found, it is added to the result list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays.",
