  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The length of the first side of the triangle.\n        b (float): The length of the second side of the triangle.\n        c (float): The length of the third side of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    \n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    \n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the lengths of the sides of the triangle from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first side: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second side: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of the third side: \"))\n\n    # Check if the sides can form a triangle\n    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:\n        # Calculate the area of the triangle\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c)\n        \n        # Print the area of the triangle\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is {area:.2f} square units.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The sides cannot form a triangle.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. This formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` is given by `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`, where `s` is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, given by `(a + b + c) / 2`. The program also checks if the sides can form a triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.",
