  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the total cost of items after applying discounts based on the total amount spent. If the total amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount. If the total amount is greater than $50 but less than or equal to $100, apply a 5% discount. For amounts less than or equal to $50, no discount is applied.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate total cost after discount\ndef calculate_total_cost(items):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of items after applying discounts.\n\n    Args:\n        items (list): A list of item prices.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost after discount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the total amount spent\n    total_amount = sum(items)\n\n    # Apply discounts based on the total amount spent\n    if total_amount > 100:\n        discount = 0.10  # 10% discount\n    elif 50 < total_amount <= 100:\n        discount = 0.05  # 5% discount\n    else:\n        discount = 0.00  # No discount\n\n    # Calculate the total cost after discount\n    total_cost = total_amount * (1 - discount)\n\n    return total_cost\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    # List of item prices\n    items = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\n\n    # Calculate the total cost after discount\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(items)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Total cost after discount: $\", round(total_cost, 2))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_total_cost` that takes a list of item prices as input.\n2. Calculate the total amount spent by summing up all the item prices.\n3. Apply discounts based on the total amount spent:\n   - If the total amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount.\n   - If the total amount is greater than $50 but less than or equal to $100, apply a 5% discount.\n   - For amounts less than or equal to $50, no discount is applied.\n4. Calculate the total cost after discount by multiplying the total amount by (1 - discount percentage).\n5. Return the total cost after discount.\n6. In the `main` function, provide an example usage of the `calculate_total_cost` function with a list of item prices.\n7. Print the total cost after discount.\n\n**Advice**\n\n- You can modify the `items` list in the `main` function to test the program with different sets of item prices.\n- The program uses a simple discount structure, but you can extend it to accommodate more complex discount rules by modifying the `calculate_total_cost` function accordingly.",
