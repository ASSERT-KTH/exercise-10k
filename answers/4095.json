  "answer": "### Waiting Function with Async/Await\n#### Overview\n\nThe following code snippet provides an example of an asynchronous function in JavaScript that waits for a specified amount of time before returning a message. This function utilizes the `setTimeout` function wrapped in a promise to achieve the asynchronous waiting behavior.\n\n#### Code\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Asynchronously waits for a specified amount of time before returning a message.\n * @param {number} waitTimeMs - The time to wait in milliseconds.\n * @param {string} message - The message to return after waiting.\n * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves with the message after waiting.\n */\nasync function waitForMessage(waitTimeMs, message) {\n    return new Promise((resolve) => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            resolve(message);\n        }, waitTimeMs);\n    });\n}\n\n// Example usage\nasync function main() {\n    try {\n        const message = await waitForMessage(1000, \"Hello, World!\");\n        console.log(message);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"An error occurred:\", error);\n    }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: The `waitForMessage` function is defined as an `async` function, allowing it to return a promise and use `await` internally.\n2.  **Promise Creation**: Inside `waitForMessage`, a new promise is created using the `Promise` constructor. This promise is resolved after the specified wait time, returning the provided message.\n3.  **Timeout Setup**: The `setTimeout` function is used to schedule the resolution of the promise after the specified `waitTimeMs`.\n4.  **Example Usage**: In the `main` function, an example is provided where `waitForMessage` is called with a wait time of 1 second (1000 milliseconds) and a message. The `await` keyword is used to pause execution until the promise returned by `waitForMessage` is resolved, at which point the message is logged to the console.\n\nThis code demonstrates a basic asynchronous waiting function in JavaScript, which can be adapted for various use cases requiring delayed execution or message delivery.",
