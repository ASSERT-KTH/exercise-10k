  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple quiz program written in Python that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each question\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter the letter of your answer: \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {options['answer']}.\\n\")\n\n    # Print final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `questions` with each key being a question and the corresponding value being another dictionary with options and the correct answer.\n2. The `quiz` function initializes a score variable to 0 and then iterates over each question in the `questions` dictionary.\n3. For each question, it prints the question and options, and then asks the user to enter the letter of their answer.\n4. If the user's answer matches the correct answer, it increments the score and prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message with the correct answer.\n5. After all questions have been asked, it prints the final score.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n------------------\n\nTo run the quiz program, simply execute the script. You will be presented with a series of questions, and your answers will be tracked. After completing all questions, your final score will be displayed.",
