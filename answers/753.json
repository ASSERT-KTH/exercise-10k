  "answer": "**Bank Account Simulator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program simulates a basic bank account and allows users to deposit and withdraw money. It also keeps track of the account balance and displays it after each transaction.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative\")\n        self.balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the current account balance.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Simulator Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n                account.deposit(amount)\n                print(f\"Deposit successful. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n                print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to deposit money.\n2. Enter the amount to deposit (e.g., 100).\n3. The program will display the new balance after the deposit.\n4. Select option 2 to withdraw money.\n5. Enter the amount to withdraw (e.g., 50).\n6. The program will display the new balance after the withdrawal.\n7. Select option 3 to check the current balance.\n8. Select option 4 to exit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to simulate a bank account. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods update the account balance accordingly, and the `get_balance` method returns the current balance. The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the bank account simulator.",
