  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints a pattern of numbers using nested for loops:\n\n```python\n# Program to print a pattern of numbers using nested for loops\n\n# Function to print the pattern\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number up to which the pattern is printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            print(j, end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(\"Pattern:\")\nprint_pattern(5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the input number. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  **Outer Loop:** The outer loop (`for i in range(1, n + 1)`) iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n2.  **Inner Loop:** The inner loop (`for j in range(1, i + 1)`) iterates from 1 to the current value of the outer loop (`i`).\n3.  **Printing Numbers:** Inside the inner loop, the program prints the current number (`j`) followed by a space (`end=\" \"`).\n4.  **New Line:** After the inner loop completes, the program prints a new line (`print()`) to move to the next line of the pattern.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this program with `n = 5`, it prints the following pattern:\n\n```\nPattern:\n1 \n1 2 \n1 2 3 \n1 2 3 4 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n```\n\nYou can adjust the value of `n` to print patterns of different sizes.",
