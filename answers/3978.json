  "prompt": "Implement the radix sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The program should take a list of integers as input and output the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of radix sort:\n\n```python\ndef radix_sort(nums):\n    RADIX = 10\n    placement = 1\n\n    max_digit = max(nums)\n\n    while placement < max_digit:\n        buckets = [list() for _ in range(RADIX)]\n        for i in nums:\n            tmp = int((i / placement) % RADIX)\n            buckets[tmp].append(i)\n        a = 0\n        for b in range(RADIX):\n            buck = buckets[b]\n            for i in buck:\n                nums[a] = i\n                a += 1\n        placement *= RADIX\n    return nums\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", radix_sort(numbers))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function called `radix_sort` that takes a list of integers as input.\n*   We use the `RADIX` variable to represent the base of the given numbers (10 for decimal).\n*   We initialize the `placement` variable to 1, which will be used to determine the digit position to consider in each iteration.\n*   We find the maximum number in the list to determine the number of digits.\n*   We use a while loop to iterate through each digit position, starting from the least significant digit (ones place) to the most significant digit.\n*   Inside the loop, we create empty buckets for each possible digit value (0-9).\n*   We distribute the numbers into the buckets based on the current digit being considered.\n*   We collect the numbers from the buckets and update the original list.\n*   We repeat this process until we have considered all digit positions.\n*   Finally, we return the sorted list.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `radix_sort` function to sort a list of integers. The output will be the sorted list in ascending order.",
