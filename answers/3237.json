  "answer": "**Median of Two Sorted Arrays Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the median of two sorted arrays. It merges the two arrays into a single sorted array and then finds the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_median(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the median of two sorted arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Merge the two arrays into a single sorted array\n    merged = sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n\n    # Get the length of the merged array\n    n = len(merged)\n\n    # If the length is odd, the median is the middle element\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return merged[n // 2]\n    # If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements\n    else:\n        return (merged[n // 2 - 1] + merged[n // 2]) / 2\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n    median = find_median(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_median` function takes two sorted arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input.\n2. It merges the two arrays into a single sorted array using the `sorted` function and the `+` operator to concatenate the arrays.\n3. It calculates the length of the merged array using the `len` function.\n4. If the length is odd, it returns the middle element as the median.\n5. If the length is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements as the median.\n6. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `find_median` function with two sample arrays.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the total number of elements in the two arrays. However, this can be optimized to O(n) using a more efficient merging algorithm or a data structure like a heap.",
