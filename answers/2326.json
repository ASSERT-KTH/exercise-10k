  "prompt": "Write a program to take a user's name and age as input and print a greeting message with their name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes a user's name and age as input and prints a greeting message:\n\n```python\n# Take user's name and age as input\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n# Print a greeting message with the user's name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- We use the built-in `input()` function to take the user's name and age as input.\n- The `input()` function returns a string, so we don't need to explicitly convert the input to a string.\n- We use an f-string (formatted string) to create a greeting message with the user's name and age. The f-string allows us to embed expressions inside string literals, using the `f` prefix.\n\nHere's how you can run this program:\n\n1. Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `greeting.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using the Python interpreter by typing `python greeting.py`.\n4. Enter your name and age when prompted, and the program will print a greeting message with your name and age.\n\nExample output:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```",
