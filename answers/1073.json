  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to validate a password and ensure it meets certain criteria such as length and character types.\n\n### Criteria\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a password based on the given criteria.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check length\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check for uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check for lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check for digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check for special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    while not validate_password(password):\n        print(\"Password is invalid. Please try again.\")\n        password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `validate_password` function checks the password against the given criteria.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a password and then checks it using the `validate_password` function.\n3. If the password is invalid, the user is prompted to try again.\n4. This process repeats until a valid password is entered.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a password that meets all the criteria: `Password123!`\n* Enter a password that is too short: `pass`\n* Enter a password that does not contain an uppercase letter: `password123!`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a lowercase letter: `PASSWORD123!`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a digit: `Password!`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a special character: `Password123`",
