  "answer": "### Function to Find Index of Target Value in Array\n#### Description\nThis function takes in an array and a target value, then returns the index of the target value in the array if it exists. If the target value does not exist, it returns a message indicating that the value was not found.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef find_index(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of a target value in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The list to search in.\n        target: The value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or str: The index of the target value if found, otherwise a message indicating that the value was not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Attempt to find the index of the target value\n        index = array.index(target)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the target value is not found, return a message\n        return \"Target value not found in array.\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    target = 3\n    result = find_index(array, target)\n    print(result)  # Output: 2\n\n    target = 6\n    result = find_index(array, target)\n    print(result)  # Output: Target value not found in array.\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `find_index` takes in two parameters: `array` and `target`.\n2. It attempts to find the index of the `target` value in the `array` using the `index` method.\n3. If the `target` value is found, its index is returned.\n4. If the `target` value is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, which is caught and handled by returning a message indicating that the value was not found.\n\n#### Advice\n* Make sure to handle potential exceptions that may be raised when working with arrays and target values.\n* Consider using this function as a building block for more complex array searching tasks.\n* You can modify the function to return a custom message or handle the `ValueError` exception differently based on your specific use case.",
