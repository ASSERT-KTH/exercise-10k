  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should use a basic algorithm to iterate through the array and find the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\n#include <cassert>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint max(int* arr, int length) {\n  assert(length > 0);\n  int max_val = arr[0];\n  for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] > max_val) {\n      max_val = arr[i];\n    }\n  }\n  return max_val;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n  int length = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n  std::cout << \"Maximum value: \" << max(arr, length) << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
