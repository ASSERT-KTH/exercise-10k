  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 mosaic pattern of asterisks (*) and dots (.).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n# Header\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\n# Program Description\n# This program prints a 5x5 mosaic pattern of asterisks (*) and dots (.).\n\n# Code\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n            print('*', end=' ')\n        else:\n            print('.', end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they would depend on the actual author and date of creation. You can fill those in as needed. The code itself is a direct implementation of the specification, using nested for loops to print the mosaic pattern.",
