  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the coefficients of a linear equation as input and prints its solution.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve_linear_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a linear equation of the form ax + b = c.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (float): The coefficient of x.\n        b (float): The constant term on the left side of the equation.\n        c (float): The constant term on the right side of the equation.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The solution to the equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        if b == c:\n            return \"Infinite solutions\"\n        else:\n            return \"No solution\"\n    else:\n        return (c - b) / a\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coefficients from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the coefficient of x: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the constant term on the left side of the equation: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the constant term on the right side of the equation: \"))\n\n    # Solve and print the solution\n    solution = solve_linear_equation(a, b, c)\n    print(\"The solution to the equation is:\", solution)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `solve_linear_equation` function takes the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input and returns the solution to the equation `ax + b = c`.\n* If `a` is zero, the function checks if `b` is equal to `c`. If they are equal, the equation has infinite solutions. If they are not equal, the equation has no solution.\n* If `a` is not zero, the function solves the equation by subtracting `b` from `c` and dividing the result by `a`.\n* The `main` function gets the coefficients from the user, solves the equation using the `solve_linear_equation` function, and prints the solution.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Solve the equation `2x + 3 = 5`:\n\t+ Enter `2` as the coefficient of `x`.\n\t+ Enter `3` as the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n\t+ Enter `5` as the constant term on the right side of the equation.\n\t+ The program will output `The solution to the equation is: 1.0`.\n* Solve the equation `x + 2 = 2`:\n\t+ Enter `1` as the coefficient of `x`.\n\t+ Enter `2` as the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n\t+ Enter `2` as the constant term on the right side of the equation.\n\t+ The program will output `The solution to the equation is: 0.0`.\n* Solve the equation `0x + 2 = 3`:\n\t+ Enter `0` as the coefficient of `x`.\n\t+ Enter `2` as the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n\t+ Enter `3` as the constant term on the right side of the equation.\n\t+ The program will output `The solution to the equation is: No solution`.",
