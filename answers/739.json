  "answer": "**Currency Converter Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes an amount in one currency as input and outputs its equivalent amount in another currency. This program uses the `forex_python` library to fetch the current exchange rates.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.x\n* `forex_python` library (`pip install forex_python`)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates\n\ndef convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert an amount from one currency to another.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (float): The amount to convert.\n        from_currency (str): The currency to convert from (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', etc.).\n        to_currency (str): The currency to convert to (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', etc.).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The converted amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    c = CurrencyRates()\n    result = c.convert(from_currency, to_currency, amount)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount: \"))\n    from_currency = input(\"Enter the currency to convert from (e.g., USD, EUR, etc.): \").upper()\n    to_currency = input(\"Enter the currency to convert to (e.g., USD, EUR, etc.): \").upper()\n\n    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)\n    print(f\"{amount} {from_currency} is equal to {converted_amount} {to_currency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the amount you want to convert (e.g., `100`).\n3. Enter the currency to convert from (e.g., `USD`).\n4. Enter the currency to convert to (e.g., `EUR`).\n5. The program will output the converted amount (e.g., `88.72 EUR`).\n\nNote: The exchange rates are fetched in real-time, so the conversion rates may vary depending on the current market rates.",
