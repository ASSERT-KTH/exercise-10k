  "answer": "**Nested Loops Example**\n=========================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that uses nested loops to iterate over a sequence and perform tasks.\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program creates a 3x3 grid and fills it with numbers from 1 to 9. It then uses nested loops to iterate over the grid and print each number.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the grid using nested loops.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(grid)):  # outer loop\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):  # inner loop\n            print(grid[i][j], end=\" \")  # print each number\n        print()  # new line after each row\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a 3x3 grid\n    grid = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Grid:\")\n    print_grid(grid)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\nGrid:\n1 2 3 \n4 5 6 \n7 8 9 \n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_grid` function takes a 2D grid as input and uses nested loops to iterate over each element.\n2. The outer loop (`for i in range(len(grid))`) iterates over each row in the grid.\n3. The inner loop (`for j in range(len(grid[i]))`) iterates over each column in the current row.\n4. The `print` statement inside the inner loop prints each number in the grid.\n5. The `main` function creates a sample 3x3 grid and calls the `print_grid` function to print it.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Use nested loops when you need to iterate over a multi-dimensional data structure.\n* Make sure to understand the indexing and bounds of your data structure to avoid errors.\n* Use descriptive variable names and comments to make your code readable and maintainable.",
