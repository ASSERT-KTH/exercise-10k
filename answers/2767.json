  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Return the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'quit' to exit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'quit':\n            break\n        elif user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `determine_winner` function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input and determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. The `main` function plays the game in an infinite loop until the user chooses to quit.\n4. The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the computer's choice is generated randomly.\n5. The result of the game is determined and printed to the console.\n\nNote that this implementation uses a simple `random` module to generate the computer's choice. You can modify the `get_computer_choice` function to use a more sophisticated random number generator if needed.",
