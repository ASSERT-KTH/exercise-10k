  "answer": "**GPA Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their grades and calculates their GPA based on the following scale:\n- A: 4.0\n- B: 3.0\n- C: 2.0\n- D: 1.0\n- F: 0.0\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for their grades and calculates their GPA.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize variables\n    total_credits = 0\n    total_points = 0\n\n    # Ask the user for the number of courses\n    num_courses = int(input(\"Enter the number of courses: \"))\n\n    # Create a dictionary to map grades to GPA points\n    grade_points = {\n        'A': 4.0,\n        'B': 3.0,\n        'C': 2.0,\n        'D': 1.0,\n        'F': 0.0\n    }\n\n    # Loop through each course\n    for i in range(num_courses):\n        print(f\"\\nCourse {i+1}:\")\n        \n        # Ask the user for the grade\n        while True:\n            grade = input(\"Enter your grade (A, B, C, D, F): \").upper()\n            if grade in grade_points:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid grade. Please enter A, B, C, D, or F.\")\n        \n        # Ask the user for the number of credits\n        while True:\n            try:\n                credits = int(input(\"Enter the number of credits: \"))\n                if credits > 0:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Invalid number of credits. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        \n        # Update the total credits and points\n        total_credits += credits\n        total_points += grade_points[grade] * credits\n\n    # Calculate the GPA\n    if total_credits == 0:\n        print(\"No courses entered. Cannot calculate GPA.\")\n    else:\n        gpa = total_points / total_credits\n        print(f\"\\nYour GPA is: {gpa:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the program\ncalculate_gpa()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the number of courses you want to calculate your GPA for.\n2. For each course, enter your grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and the number of credits.\n3. The program will calculate your GPA based on the grades and credits you entered.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter valid input. It includes error checking to ensure that the user enters a valid grade and a positive integer for the number of credits.",
