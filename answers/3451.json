  "answer": "**Magic 8-Ball Simulator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program simulates a Magic 8-Ball, where the user asks a question and the program provides a random answer.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define a list of possible Magic 8-Ball answers\nanswers = [\n    'It is certain',\n    'It is decidedly so',\n    'Without a doubt',\n    'Yes definitely',\n    'You may rely on it',\n    'As I see it, yes',\n    'Most likely',\n    'Outlook good',\n    'Yes',\n    'Signs point to yes',\n    'Reply hazy try again',\n    'Ask again later',\n    'Better not tell you now',\n    'Cannot predict now',\n    'Concentrate and ask again',\n    'Don\\'t count on it',\n    'My reply is no',\n    'My sources say no',\n    'Outlook not so good',\n    'Very doubtful'\n]\n\ndef get_answer():\n    \"\"\"Returns a random Magic 8-Ball answer.\"\"\"\n    return random.choice(answers)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball simulator!\")\n    while True:\n        question = input(\"Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if question.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        answer = get_answer()\n        print(f\"The Magic 8-Ball says: {answer}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Ask a question when prompted (e.g., \"Will it rain tomorrow?\").\n3. The program will respond with a random Magic 8-Ball answer (e.g., \"Reply hazy try again\").\n4. Continue asking questions until you want to exit (type 'quit' to exit).\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program defines a list of possible Magic 8-Ball answers.\n2. The `get_answer` function returns a random answer from the list.\n3. The `main` function runs a loop where the user is prompted to ask a question.\n4. If the user types 'quit', the program exits. Otherwise, it calls `get_answer` to get a random response and prints it to the console.",
