  "answer": "**Reverse Number Printer**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef print_reverse_numbers():\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(10, 0, -1):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_reverse_numbers()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 10, stopping at 1 (since the stop value is exclusive), and decrementing by 1 each time (`-1` is the step value).\n* The `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n* Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to output the current number.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `reverse_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python reverse_numbers.py`) to see the output.",
