  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two integers as input and outputs the result of raising the first number to the power of the second.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    return base ** exponent\n\ndef main():\n    base = int(input(\"Enter the base number: \"))\n    exponent = int(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `power` that takes two integers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the base and exponent, calls the `power` function, and then prints the result. \n\nTo use this program, simply run it, enter the base and exponent when prompted, and it will print the result. \n\nFor example, if you enter `2` as the base and `3` as the exponent, the program will output `8`, because 2^3 = 8.",
