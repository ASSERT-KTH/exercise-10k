  "answer": "**Digital Root Calculation Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe digital root of a number is the recursive sum of its digits until a single-digit number is obtained.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef digital_root(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the digital root of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The digital root of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    while n > 9:\n        n = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n    return n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(digital_root(16))  # Output: 7 (1 + 6 = 7)\n    print(digital_root(942))  # Output: 6 (9 + 4 + 2 = 15, 1 + 5 = 6)\n    print(digital_root(132189))  # Output: 6 (1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24, 2 + 4 = 6)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `digital_root` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It enters a loop that continues until `n` is a single-digit number (less than or equal to 9).\n3. Inside the loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of `n` by converting `n` to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing them up.\n4. The result of the sum becomes the new value of `n`.\n5. Once `n` is a single-digit number, the loop exits, and the function returns `n`, which is the digital root of the original input number.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use a mathematical formula to calculate the digital root in a single step:\n\n```python\ndef digital_root(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the digital root of a given number using a mathematical formula.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The digital root of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (n - 1) % 9 + 1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(digital_root(16))  # Output: 7\n    print(digital_root(942))  # Output: 6\n    print(digital_root(132189))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis formula works because the digital root of a number is equivalent to the remainder of the number when divided by 9, unless the number is a multiple of 9, in which case the digital root is 9. The formula `(n - 1) % 9 + 1` handles this case correctly.",
