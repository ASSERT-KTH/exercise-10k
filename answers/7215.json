  "answer": "Here is a Python implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    i = 0\n    swapped = True\n\n    while swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        i += 1\n\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        j = 0\n        while j < n - i:\n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n            j += 1\n\n    return arr\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `bubble_sort` function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.\n*   The outer while loop iterates until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.\n*   In each iteration, the inner while loop traverses the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element, where n is the length of the array and i is the current iteration.\n*   If an element is greater than the next element, they are swapped, and the `swapped` flag is set to True.\n*   After each iteration, the last i elements are already in place, so the inner loop only needs to traverse the remaining elements.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array.\n*   In the best case (when the input array is already sorted), the time complexity is O(n), as the algorithm only needs to traverse the array once to confirm that it is sorted.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `swapped` flag and the loop indices.",
