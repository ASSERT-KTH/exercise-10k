  "answer": "### Merging Two Dictionaries with Common Keys\n\nBelow is a Python function that merges two dictionaries with common keys. This function uses the built-in `dict` methods and handles the merging of common keys by combining their values into lists.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries with common keys.\n    \n    For common keys, the values are combined into lists.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: The merged dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()  # Start with a copy of the first dictionary\n    \n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        if key in merged_dict:\n            # If the key is already in the merged dictionary, combine the values\n            if isinstance(merged_dict[key], list):\n                # If the existing value is already a list, append to it\n                merged_dict[key].append(value)\n            else:\n                # If the existing value is not a list, convert it to a list and append\n                merged_dict[key] = [merged_dict[key], value]\n        else:\n            # If the key is not in the merged dictionary, add it\n            merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}\n\nmerged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `merge_dictionaries` takes two dictionaries as input: `dict1` and `dict2`.\n2. It creates a copy of `dict1` to avoid modifying the original dictionary.\n3. It then iterates over the key-value pairs of `dict2`.\n4. For each key in `dict2`, it checks if the key is already present in the merged dictionary.\n   - If the key is present and its value is a list, it appends the value from `dict2` to this list.\n   - If the key is present but its value is not a list, it converts the existing value to a list (with the existing value as the first element) and then appends the value from `dict2`.\n   - If the key is not present, it simply adds the key-value pair from `dict2` to the merged dictionary.\n5. Finally, it returns the merged dictionary.\n\n#### Example Output\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'b': [2, 20], 'c': [3, 30], 'd': 40}\n```",
