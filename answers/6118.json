  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of integers and a key function as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers from both lists, merged according to the key function.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef merge_list(A, B, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two lists of integers based on a given key function.\n\n    Args:\n    A (list): First list of integers.\n    B (list): Second list of integers.\n    key (function): Key function to determine the order of the merged list.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing all the integers from A and B, merged according to the key function.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(A + B, key=key)\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_key = lambda x: x % 2\nA = [1, 3, 5]\nB = [2, 4, 6]\n\nprint(merge_list(A, B, my_key))\n```\nThis code defines the `merge_list` function, which takes three arguments: `A` and `B` (two lists of integers), and `key` (a key function that determines the order of the merged list). The function returns a new list containing all the integers from `A` and `B`, merged according to the `key` function.\n\nIn the example usage, the `my_key` function is defined as a lambda function that takes a single integer `x` as input and returns the remainder of `x` divided by 2. This key function is used to sort the merged list in alternating order (odd, even, odd, even, ...).\n\nWhen you run this code, it will merge the two lists `A` and `B` using the `my_key` function and print the resulting merged list.",
