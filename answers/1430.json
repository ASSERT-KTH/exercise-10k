  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list and a predicate function as input and returns the first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True. If no such element is found, return None.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds the first element in a list for which a given predicate function returns True. This function will help you efficiently search through lists based on specific conditions. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_element(lst, predicate):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and a predicate function as input, \n    and returns the first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True.\n    \n    If no such element is found, it returns None.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to be searched.\n        predicate (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        The first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True, or None if no such element is found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(lst, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Check if the predicate is a callable function\n    if not callable(predicate):\n        raise TypeError(\"Predicate must be a callable function\")\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        \n        # Apply the predicate function to the current element\n        # If the predicate function returns True, return the current element\n        if predicate(element):\n            return element\n    \n    # If we have iterated over the entire list and haven't returned an element, \n    # it means that no element satisfied the predicate function, so return None\n    return None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_first_element` takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to search) and `predicate` (a function that determines whether an element matches the desired condition). It first checks if `lst` is indeed a list and if `predicate` is a callable function, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* It then iterates over each `element` in `lst`, applying the `predicate` function to each one. If `predicate(element)` returns `True`, the function immediately returns that `element`.\n* If the function iterates over the entire list without finding an element for which `predicate` returns `True`, it returns `None`, indicating that no matching element was found.\n* The function includes docstrings that provide a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier for users to understand how to use it.",
