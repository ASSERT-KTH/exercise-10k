  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python using if/else statements:\n\n```python\n# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the board with empty spaces\n\ndef print_board():\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef check_win():\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef check_draw():\n    if ' ' not in board:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef play_game():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        if check_win():\n            print_board()\n            print(\"Player {} wins! Congratulations!\".format(current_player))\n            break\n        elif check_draw():\n            print_board()\n            print(\"It's a draw!\")\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We start by initializing a board as a list of 9 empty spaces.\n*   The `print_board` function prints the current state of the board in a 3x3 grid format.\n*   The `check_win` function checks if there's a winner by examining all possible win conditions on the board.\n*   The `check_draw` function checks if the game is a draw by verifying if all spaces on the board are filled.\n*   The `play_game` function controls the game flow, allowing players to make moves and switching between players 'X' and 'O' after each move.\n*   It also checks for a win or draw condition after each move and ends the game accordingly.\n\n**How to run the game:**\n\n1.  Save the above code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the game by typing `python tic_tac_toe.py`.\n4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.",
