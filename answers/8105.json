  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the string with all upper case characters converted to lower case and all lower case characters converted to upper case.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef swap_case(s):\n    return s.swapcase()\n\n# Test the function\ns = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nprint(swap_case(s))\n```\n\nIn this program, the `swap_case` function uses the built-in `swapcase` method of Python strings, which swaps the case of all characters in the string. The `input` function is used to get a string from the user, and the result of `swap_case` is printed out.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a list comprehension to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef swap_case(s):\n    return ''.join([c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower() for c in s])\n\n# Test the function\ns = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nprint(swap_case(s))\n```\n\nIn this version of the program, the `swap_case` function uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each character in the input string is converted to upper case if it is lower case, and vice versa. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the characters in the list back into a string.",
