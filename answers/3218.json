  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal, rate, and time as input and prints the compound interest.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the compound interest:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% is 0.04)\n        time (int): The time period (in years)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    ci = principal * (1 + rate) ** time - principal\n    return ci\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    ci = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: {ci:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_compound_interest` function calculates the compound interest using the formula `A = P * (1 + r) ^ t`, where `A` is the amount after `t` years, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period. The compound interest is then calculated as `A - P`.\n* The `main` function takes the principal, rate, and time as input from the user, calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function, and prints the result.\n* The `rate` is divided by 100 to convert it from percentage to decimal form.\n* The `time` is assumed to be in years.\n* The result is printed with two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nThe compound interest is: 102.5\n```",
