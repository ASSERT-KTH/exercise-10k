  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list as input, and returns its mean, median, and standard deviation.",
  "answer": "Here's an implementation of a program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a given list in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistics(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list.\n\n    Args:\n    input_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = np.mean(input_list)\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    median = np.median(input_list)\n    \n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    std_dev = np.std(input_list)\n    \n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function with a sample list\n    input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(input_list)\n    \n    print(f\"Input List: {input_list}\")\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Importing numpy**: The `numpy` library is used for its built-in functions to calculate mean, median, and standard deviation.\n2. **Defining `calculate_statistics` function**: This function takes a list as input and calculates its mean, median, and standard deviation using `np.mean`, `np.median`, and `np.std`, respectively.\n3. **Defining `main` function**: This function tests `calculate_statistics` with a sample list and prints the results.\n4. **Running the program**: The program is run by executing the `main` function when the script is launched directly.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to install the `numpy` library before running this program. You can install it using pip: `pip install numpy`.\n* This program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list can contain other types of data, you should add error checking code to handle such cases.\n* The standard deviation calculated by `np.std` is the sample standard deviation. If you want to calculate the population standard deviation, use `np.std(input_list, ddof=0)`.",
