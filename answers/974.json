  "prompt": "Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the difference between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in one dictionary but not the other.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function to find the difference between two dictionaries, highlighting the key-value pairs that exist in one dictionary but not the other. This function will enable you to compare and identify unique elements in each dictionary. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the difference between two dictionaries.\n    \n    It returns a tuple of two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2.\n    The second dictionary contains key-value pairs that exist in dict2 but not in dict1.\n\n    Parameters:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple of two dictionaries representing the differences between the input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store key-value pairs that exist in dict1 but not in dict2\n    diff1 = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in dict1\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # Check if the key is not in dict2 or if the values are different\n        if key not in dict2 or dict2[key] != value:\n            # Add the key-value pair to diff1\n            diff1[key] = value\n    \n    # Create an empty dictionary to store key-value pairs that exist in dict2 but not in dict1\n    diff2 = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in dict2\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # Check if the key is not in dict1 or if the values are different\n        if key not in dict1 or dict1[key] != value:\n            # Add the key-value pair to diff2\n            diff2[key] = value\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing diff1 and diff2\n    return diff1, diff2\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\nprint(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `dict_diff` takes two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` as input and returns a tuple of two dictionaries representing the differences between the input dictionaries.\n* It iterates over each key-value pair in `dict1` and `dict2`, checking if the key is not in the other dictionary or if the values are different. If so, it adds the key-value pair to the corresponding difference dictionary (`diff1` or `diff2`).\n* The function uses conditional statements (`if key not in dict2 or dict2[key] != value`) to determine whether a key-value pair exists in one dictionary but not the other.\n* Finally, it returns a tuple containing `diff1` and `diff2`, which represent the key-value pairs that exist in `dict1` but not in `dict2` and vice versa.",
