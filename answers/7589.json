  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given variable is a tuple.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a Python program that checks if a given variable is a tuple, addressing your request for a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef check_tuple(var):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given variable is a tuple.\n    \n    Args:\n        var: The variable to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the variable is a tuple, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We will use the isinstance() function in Python, which checks if an object (first argument) is an instance or subclass of a class (second argument).\n    # The type of a tuple in Python is tuple, so we will use this as our second argument.\n    return isinstance(var, tuple)\n\n# Test the function\nvar1 = (1, 2, 3)  # This is a tuple\nvar2 = [1, 2, 3]  # This is a list\nvar3 = \"Hello\"    # This is a string\n\nprint(check_tuple(var1))  # Expected output: True\nprint(check_tuple(var2))  # Expected output: False\nprint(check_tuple(var3))  # Expected output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `check_tuple` function takes a variable `var` as input and checks its type using the `isinstance()` function.\n* The `isinstance()` function checks if the `var` is an instance or subclass of the `tuple` class, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.\n* The function is then tested with different types of variables (`var1`, `var2`, `var3`) to demonstrate its functionality.\n* The `print` statements display the results of the `check_tuple` function for each variable, confirming whether they are tuples or not.",
