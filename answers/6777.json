  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero. The program should ask the user for a number and then print out whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that does exactly that:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for a number\nnum = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero\nif num > 0:\n    print(\"The number is positive.\")\nelif num < 0:\n    print(\"The number is negative.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The number is zero.\")\n```\n\nLet me explain what's going on:\n\n1. `num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))` asks the user for a number and converts it to a floating-point number (so we can handle decimal numbers too).\n2. The `if-elif-else` statement checks the value of `num`.\n   * If `num` is greater than 0, we print that the number is positive.\n   * If `num` is less than 0, we print that the number is negative.\n   * If `num` is neither greater than nor less than 0, it must be equal to 0, so we print that the number is zero.\n\nYou can save this code to a file with a `.py` extension and run it from the command line using Python (e.g., `python program.py`). When you run it, it will ask you for a number and then print out whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.",
