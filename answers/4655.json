  "prompt": "Create a program that manages a game scoreboard. The user can add or remove points from the scoreboard, and the program displays the current score.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that manages a game scoreboard:\n\n```python\nclass Scoreboard:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def add_points(self, points):\n        \"\"\"Add points to the scoreboard.\"\"\"\n        self.score += points\n        print(f\"Added {points} points. Current score: {self.score}\")\n\n    def remove_points(self, points):\n        \"\"\"Remove points from the scoreboard.\"\"\"\n        if points > self.score:\n            print(\"Not enough points to remove.\")\n        else:\n            self.score -= points\n            print(f\"Removed {points} points. Current score: {self.score}\")\n\n    def display_score(self):\n        \"\"\"Display the current score.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current score: {self.score}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    scoreboard = Scoreboard()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nScoreboard Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add points\")\n        print(\"2. Remove points\")\n        print(\"3. Display score\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        if choice == \"1\":\n            points = int(input(\"Enter points to add: \"))\n            scoreboard.add_points(points)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            points = int(input(\"Enter points to remove: \"))\n            scoreboard.remove_points(points)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            scoreboard.display_score()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `Scoreboard` class has methods to add points, remove points, and display the current score.\n2. The `main` function creates a `Scoreboard` object and enters a loop where it continuously asks the user for input.\n3. The user can choose to add points, remove points, display the score, or quit the program.\n4. Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding action.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Add 10 points to the scoreboard: Enter `1` at the menu, then enter `10` when prompted for points to add.\n* Remove 5 points from the scoreboard: Enter `2` at the menu, then enter `5` when prompted for points to remove.\n* Display the current score: Enter `3` at the menu.\n* Quit the program: Enter `4` at the menu.",
