  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n====================================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It calculates the average by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Running the Program**\n------------------------\n\nSave the above code in a file (e.g., `average.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python average.py`). The program will output the average of the numbers in the example list. You can replace the example list with your own list of numbers to calculate the average.",
