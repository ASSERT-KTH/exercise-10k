  "answer": "### Character Frequency Counter Function\n\nHere's a Python function that uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count character frequencies from.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `count_character_frequency` takes an input string and initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict`.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, it increments the corresponding value by 1. Otherwise, it adds the character to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n4. Finally, the function returns the dictionary containing the character frequencies.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use this function with an example string and print out the character frequencies.\n\n#### Alternative Solution Using `collections` Module\n\nYou can also use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to achieve the same result with less code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    return Counter(input_string)\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
