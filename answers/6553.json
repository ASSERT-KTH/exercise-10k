  "answer": "**Pig Latin Translator Function**\n================================\n\nThe following function translates a given string into Pig Latin. This function follows the standard Pig Latin rules, where words that begin with a vowel are appended with \"way\" and words that begin with a consonant are moved to the end of the word and appended with \"ay\".\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef translate_to_pig_latin(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Translates a given word into Pig Latin.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    word (str): The word to be translated.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The translated word in Pig Latin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define vowels\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    \n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n    if word[0].lower() in vowels:\n        # If it starts with a vowel, append 'way'\n        return word + 'way'\n    else:\n        # If it starts with a consonant, move it to the end and append 'ay'\n        for i, char in enumerate(word):\n            if char.lower() in vowels:\n                # Find the index of the first vowel\n                return word[i:] + word[:i] + 'ay'\n        # If the word contains no vowels, just append 'ay'\n        return word + 'ay'\n\ndef translate_sentence_to_pig_latin(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Translates a given sentence into Pig Latin.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    sentence (str): The sentence to be translated.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The translated sentence in Pig Latin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Translate each word into Pig Latin\n    translated_words = [translate_to_pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    \n    # Join the translated words back into a sentence\n    return ' '.join(translated_words)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    word = \"hello\"\n    sentence = \"hello world\"\n    print(f\"The Pig Latin translation of '{word}' is: {translate_to_pig_latin(word)}\")\n    print(f\"The Pig Latin translation of '{sentence}' is: {translate_sentence_to_pig_latin(sentence)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function checks if the input word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel in the word, moves all characters before the vowel to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\".\n3. If the word contains no vowels, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n4. The `translate_sentence_to_pig_latin` function splits a sentence into words, translates each word into Pig Latin using the `translate_to_pig_latin` function, and then joins the translated words back into a sentence.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to use the functions to translate a word and a sentence into Pig Latin.",
