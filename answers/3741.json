  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Algorithm**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python, which sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Repeat the process until the list is sorted\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n                # Set the flag to True\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the last iteration, the list is sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  It iterates over the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.\n3.  If a pair of elements is in the wrong order, it swaps them.\n4.  The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n5.  The function returns the sorted list.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it less efficient for large datasets compared to other sorting algorithms like QuickSort or Merge Sort, which have average time complexities of O(n log n). However, Bubble Sort can be useful for small lists or educational purposes.",
