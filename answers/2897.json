  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd_euclidean(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef gcd_multiple(*args):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the GCD of multiple integers.\"\"\"\n    result = args[0]\n    for num in args[1:]:\n        result = gcd_euclidean(result, num)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function with two integers\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {gcd_euclidean(num1, num2)}\")\n\n    # Test the function with multiple integers\n    numbers = [12, 24, 36, 48]\n    print(f\"GCD of {numbers}: {gcd_multiple(*numbers)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `gcd_euclidean` function takes two integers as input and uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate their GCD. It iteratively replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. The GCD is then the absolute value of `a`.\n*   The `gcd_multiple` function extends the `gcd_euclidean` function to calculate the GCD of multiple integers. It initializes the result with the first number and then iteratively calculates the GCD of the result and the next number in the list.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions with example inputs.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is O(log min(a, b)), where a and b are the input integers. This is because the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the smaller number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   Calculating the GCD of two integers: `gcd_euclidean(48, 18)`\n*   Calculating the GCD of multiple integers: `gcd_multiple(12, 24, 36, 48)`",
