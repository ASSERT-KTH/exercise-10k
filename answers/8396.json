  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation. The operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the operation is not one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n    ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is '/' and num2 is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operation from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the operation and print the result\n        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `perform_arithmetic_operation` that takes two numbers and an operation as input and performs the operation. It also includes error checking to ensure that the operation is valid and that division by zero does not occur. The `main` function gets the numbers and operation from the user, calls `perform_arithmetic_operation`, and prints the result. If an error occurs, it prints an error message.",
