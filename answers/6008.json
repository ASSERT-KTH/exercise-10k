  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, and prints out a personalized message including their name and age",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```\n# Get user's name and age\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print out a personalized message\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n```\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get user input. It takes a string as an argument, which is the prompt to display to the user.\n2. The `int()` function is used to convert the user's input into an integer, since `input()` returns a string by default.\n3. The `f-string` syntax is used to create a formatted string. The `f` prefix before the string indicates that it's a formatted string literal. The expressions inside the `{}` are evaluated and replaced with their values.\n\nExample use case:\n\n* The program runs and prompts the user to enter their name.\n* The user types in their name, e.g. \"John\".\n* The program prompts the user to enter their age.\n* The user types in their age, e.g. \"30\".\n* The program prints out a message, e.g. \"Hello, John! You are 30 years old.\"",
