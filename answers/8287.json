  "answer": "**Linear Equation Solver**\n================================\n\nThis program solves a linear equation of the form `ax + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef solve_linear_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a linear equation of the form ax + b = c.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): Coefficient of x.\n        b (float): Constant term.\n        c (float): Right-hand side of the equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Solution to the equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        if b == c:\n            return \"Infinite solutions\"\n        else:\n            return \"No solution\"\n    else:\n        return (c - b) / a\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    a = float(input(\"Enter coefficient of x (a): \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter constant term (b): \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter right-hand side of the equation (c): \"))\n\n    # Solve the equation\n    solution = solve_linear_equation(a, b, c)\n\n    # Print the solution\n    if isinstance(solution, str):\n        print(solution)\n    else:\n        print(f\"The solution to the equation is x = {solution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `solve_linear_equation` function takes in the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input and returns the solution to the equation.\n2. If `a` is zero, the equation is either true for all values of `x` (if `b == c`) or has no solution (if `b != c`).\n3. Otherwise, the solution is calculated using the formula `(c - b) / a`.\n4. The `main` function gets user input for the coefficients, solves the equation using the `solve_linear_equation` function, and prints the solution.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Solve the equation `2x + 3 = 5`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 5`\n\t+ Output: `x = 1`\n* Solve the equation `x - 2 = 3`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 1`, `b = -2`, `c = 3`\n\t+ Output: `x = 5`\n* Solve the equation `0x + 2 = 2`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 2`\n\t+ Output: `Infinite solutions`",
