  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, print out if the guess is higher or lower than the generated number.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        # If the user's guess is too high\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n        # If the user's guess is too low\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nWhen you run this program, it will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you to guess it. After each guess, it will print out if your guess is higher or lower than the generated number. You can keep guessing until you find the correct number. If you want to quit, you can type \"quit\" at any time.\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. It then enters a loop where it continually asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program will reveal the correct number and exit the loop.\n4. If the user enters a number, the program will check if it's a valid integer and if it's within the correct range (1-100).\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the program will congratulate the user and exit the loop.\n6. If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program will print out a hint and continue to the next iteration of the loop.",
