  "prompt": "Write a higher-order function that takes a function and a list of numbers as input and applies the function to each number in the list.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a higher-order function that applies a given function to each number in a list, explaining the process and code in detail. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_function(func, numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to each number in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of results after applying the function to each number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Apply the function to the current number and append the result to the list\n        results.append(func(num))\n\n    # Return the list of results\n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\ndef square(x):\n    # A simple function that squares a number\n    return x ** 2\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(apply_function(square, numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes two parameters: `func` (the function to be applied) and `numbers` (a list of numbers). It initializes an empty list `results` to store the outcomes of applying `func` to each number.\n* It iterates over each number `num` in the `numbers` list, applies the provided `func` to `num`, and appends the result to the `results` list.\n* The function `square(x)` is defined as an example function to be applied, which simply squares its input `x`.\n* In the example usage, `apply_function` is called with `square` as the function and a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, demonstrating how to use the higher-order function to transform a list of numbers by applying a specific operation (in this case, squaring) to each element.",
