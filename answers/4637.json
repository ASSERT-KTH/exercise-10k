  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns the symmetric difference between the two arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that creates a function to calculate the symmetric difference between two input arrays:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the symmetric difference between two input arrays.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The symmetric difference between arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert input lists to sets for efficient set operations\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetric difference using set operations\n    symmetric_diff = (set1 - set2) | (set2 - set1)\n    \n    # Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it\n    return list(symmetric_diff)\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nprint(symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2))\n```\n\nThis program uses Python's built-in `set` data type to efficiently calculate the symmetric difference. It first converts the input arrays to sets, then uses set operations to calculate the symmetric difference. The resulting set is converted back to a list before being returned.\n\n**Explanation of the set operations:**\n\n* `set1 - set2` calculates the elements that are in `set1` but not in `set2`.\n* `set2 - set1` calculates the elements that are in `set2` but not in `set1`.\n* The `|` operator calculates the union of the two sets, effectively combining the results of the two set differences.\n\nThe symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in exactly one of the two input sets. This is equivalent to the union of the two set differences calculated above.",
