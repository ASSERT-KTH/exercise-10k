  "prompt": "Create a program that defines and uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the corresponding operation. The program should then use these functions to calculate and print the results of the operations given the sample inputs.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specification describes:\n```\n# Define add function\ndef add(x, y):\n    print(f\"Adding {x} + {y}\")\n    return x + y\n\n# Define subtract function\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    print(f\"Subtracting {y} from {x}\")\n    return x - y\n\n# Define multiply function\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    print(f\"Multiplying {x} * {y}\")\n    return x * y\n\n# Define divide function\ndef divide(x, y):\n    print(f\"Dividing {x} / {y}\")\n    return x / y\n\n# Test the functions\nprint(\"Let's do some math with just functions!\")\n\nage = add(30, 5)\nheight = subtract(78, 4)\nweight = multiply(90, 2)\niq = divide(100, 2)\n\nprint(f\"Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Weight: {weight}, IQ: {iq}\")\n```\nThis code defines the four functions as specified, and then tests them with the sample inputs. The output will be:\n```\nLet's do some math with just functions!\nAdding 30 + 5\nSubtracting 4 from 78\nMultiplying 90 * 2\nDividing 100 / 2\nAge: 35, Height: 74, Weight: 180, IQ: 50.0\n```",
