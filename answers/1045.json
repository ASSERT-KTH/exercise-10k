  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and an element as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nfunction findIndex(array, element) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    if (array[i] === element) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n  return -1;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\nconst element = 5;\nconst index = findIndex(array, element);\nconsole.log(index); // Output: 4\n```\nNote that I've added some example usage at the end to demonstrate how the function can be called with an array and an element, and what the output would be.",
