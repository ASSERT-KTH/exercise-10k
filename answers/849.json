  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared, using a lambda function. This will involve explaining the original code provided and enhancing it for clarity and readability. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with each number squared.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(num_list, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Then, we use a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is squared.\n    # We use a lambda function to square each number.\n    # The lambda function is defined as lambda x: x**2, which means it takes one argument x and returns x squared.\n    squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x**2, num_list))\n\n    # Finally, we return the new list with the squared numbers.\n    return squared_list\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(square_numbers(numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `square_numbers` starts by validating the input `num_list` to ensure it's a list. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes a lambda function within the `map` function to square each number in the input list. The lambda function `lambda x: x**2` takes one argument `x` and returns its square.\n* The results from the `map` function are converted to a list using the `list` function and stored in `squared_list`.\n* Finally, the function returns `squared_list`, which contains the squared values of the original input list.",
