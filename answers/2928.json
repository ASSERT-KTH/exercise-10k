  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers and create a new array containing only the even numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that achieves this:\n\n```python\ndef get_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_numbers.append(num)\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Original numbers:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `get_even_numbers` function iterates over each number in the input `numbers` array. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., if it's even) using the modulo operator (`%`). If a number is even, it's appended to the `even_numbers` array. The function then returns this array of even numbers.\n\nWhen you run this program with the provided example numbers, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```",
