  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. If the age is above 18, the person is eligible to vote. If the age is below 18, the person is not eligible to vote.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n```python\ndef is_eligible_to_vote(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n    \n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return age >= 18\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the age from the user\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n\n    # Check if the person is eligible to vote\n    if is_eligible_to_vote(age):\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_eligible_to_vote` function takes an `age` as input and checks if it is greater than or equal to 18.\n2. The `main` function gets the age from the user and calls the `is_eligible_to_vote` function to check if the person is eligible to vote.\n3. Based on the result, it prints a message indicating whether the person is eligible to vote or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters an age of 25, the program will output: \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* If the user enters an age of 15, the program will output: \"You are not eligible to vote.\"",
