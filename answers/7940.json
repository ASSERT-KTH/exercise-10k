  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the momentum given the mass and velocity.",
  "answer": "**Momentum Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the momentum of an object given its mass and velocity. The formula for momentum is:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere p is the momentum, m is the mass, and v is the velocity.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_momentum(mass, velocity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the momentum of an object given its mass and velocity.\n\n    Args:\n        mass (float): The mass of the object in kg.\n        velocity (float): The velocity of the object in m/s.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The momentum of the object in kg*m/s.\n    \"\"\"\n    momentum = mass * velocity\n    return momentum\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Momentum Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n\n    mass = float(input(\"Enter the mass of the object (in kg): \"))\n    velocity = float(input(\"Enter the velocity of the object (in m/s): \"))\n\n    momentum = calculate_momentum(mass, velocity)\n\n    print(f\"The momentum of the object is {momentum} kg*m/s\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts. For example:\n\n```\nMomentum Calculator\n--------------------\nEnter the mass of the object (in kg): 10\nEnter the velocity of the object (in m/s): 5\nThe momentum of the object is 50.0 kg*m/s\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the formula p = m * v to calculate the momentum.\n* The mass and velocity are input by the user and must be in the correct units (kg and m/s, respectively).\n* The program prints the calculated momentum to the console.\n* The `calculate_momentum` function can be reused in other programs if needed.",
