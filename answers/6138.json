  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program will ask the user for two words and check if they are anagrams of each other.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two words are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        word1 (str): The first word.\n        word2 (str): The second word.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the words are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    word1 = word1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    word2 = word2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if the sorted words are equal\n    return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for two words\n    word1 = input(\"Enter the first word: \")\n    word2 = input(\"Enter the second word: \")\n\n    # Check if the words are anagrams\n    if are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n        print(f\"'{word1}' and '{word2}' are anagrams.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"'{word1}' and '{word2}' are not anagrams.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two words as input and checks if they are anagrams by sorting the characters in each word and comparing them.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for two words, checks if they are anagrams using the `are_anagrams` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the first word: listen\nEnter the second word: silent\n'listen' and 'silent' are anagrams.\n```",
