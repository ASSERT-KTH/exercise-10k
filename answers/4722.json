  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting message.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting message based on the input provided. This function will take a name as an argument and print out a customized greeting. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'personalized_greeting' that takes one argument, 'name'.\ndef personalized_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a personalized greeting message.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input 'name' is a string. If not, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message.\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input 'name' must be a string.\")\n\n    # Use an f-string to format the greeting message with the provided 'name'.\n    # This allows us to embed the 'name' variable inside the string.\n    greeting_message = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Print the formatted greeting message.\n    print(greeting_message)\n\n# Example usage:\npersonalized_greeting(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `personalized_greeting` is defined with a parameter `name`, which is expected to be a string. It includes a docstring that describes its purpose, the argument it takes, and what it returns.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed using `isinstance(name, str)` to ensure that the `name` argument is indeed a string. If not, a `TypeError` is raised with a message indicating that the input must be a string.\n* An f-string is used to format the greeting message. The variable `name` is embedded within the string using the syntax `f\"Hello, {name}!\"`, allowing for a personalized greeting.\n* Finally, the formatted greeting message is printed to the console using the `print` function.",
