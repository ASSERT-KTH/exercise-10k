  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that fulfills your requirements. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 and provides hints to the user after each guess.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of guesses\n    num_guesses = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"What's your guess? (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == 'q':\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of guesses\n        num_guesses += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} guesses.\".format(num_guesses))\n            break\n        # Give the user a hint if their guess is too high or too low\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. The program will provide a hint, such as \"Too high!\" or \"Too low!\".\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. If you want to quit, type 'q' and the program will reveal the number.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input until they guess the correct number or choose to quit. It also includes error checking to ensure the user enters a valid integer within the correct range.",
