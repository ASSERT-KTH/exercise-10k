  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given password meets the following requirements:\n\n* At least 8 characters long\n* Contains at least one uppercase letter\n* Contains at least one lowercase letter\n* Contains at least one digit\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following requirements:\n    - At least 8 characters long\n    - Contains at least one uppercase letter\n    - Contains at least one lowercase letter\n    - Contains at least one digit\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # If all checks pass, the password is valid\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    if validate_password(password):\n        print(\"Password is valid\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following requirements:\")\n        print(\"* At least 8 characters long\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one digit\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses a simple function `validate_password` to check if a given password meets the requirements. The function uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `validate_password` function by prompting the user to enter a password and then checking its validity.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Valid password: `Password123`\n* Invalid password: `password` (does not meet the requirements)\n* Invalid password: `PASSWORD` (does not meet the requirements)\n* Invalid password: `12345678` (does not meet the requirements)\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always use secure password storage and transmission practices in production environments.\n* Consider using more advanced password validation techniques, such as checking for common patterns or using a password strength estimator.\n* Make sure to test your password validation function thoroughly to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios.",
