  "prompt": "Write a function with a docstring that explains its purpose and usage. Then, call this function with an input value and print the result.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function with a docstring that explains its purpose and usage, and then demonstrate how to call this function with an input value and print the result. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_square(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the square of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (int or float): The input number to be squared.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The square of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return number ** 2\n\n# Call the function with an input value and print the result\nresult = calculate_square(5)\nprint(\"The square of 5 is: \", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_square` function takes one argument `number`, which can be either an integer or a float. It returns the square of this input number.\n* The function uses the exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the square of the input number, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this operation.\n* The docstring provides a clear description of the function's purpose, its input argument, and its return value, making it easier for others to understand and use the function.\n* When calling the `calculate_square` function with the input value `5`, the result is stored in the `result` variable and then printed to the console.",
