  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Handle potential errors such as division by zero and invalid operation.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers, handling potential errors such as division by zero and invalid operations. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Operation must be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\")\n\n    # Then, we perform the operation\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        # If the operation is addition, we simply add the two numbers\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        # If the operation is subtraction, we subtract the second number from the first\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        # If the operation is multiplication, we multiply the two numbers\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        # If the operation is division, we check if the second number is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        # If the second number is not zero, we divide the first number by the second\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    # Finally, we return the result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate` takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`. It first checks if the `operation` is valid, raising a `ValueError` if it's not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n* It then performs the specified `operation` on `num1` and `num2`. For division, it checks if `num2` is zero to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n* The function returns the result of the operation.\n* Error handling is implemented using `try-except` blocks, which can be added around the function call to catch and handle any potential errors, such as `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError`.",
