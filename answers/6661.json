  "answer": "**Median Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the median of a list of numbers. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list of numbers\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the list is empty, return None\n    if n == 0:\n        return None\n\n    # If the list has an odd length, the median is the middle value\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        return numbers[n // 2]\n\n    # If the list has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values\n    else:\n        return (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_median` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median.\n2. The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method.\n3. If the list is empty, the function returns `None`.\n4. If the list has an odd length, the median is the middle value, which is returned directly.\n5. If the list has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values, which is calculated and returned.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_median` function with example lists.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the median of a list of exam scores: `[80, 90, 70, 85, 95]`\n* Calculate the median of a list of temperatures: `[23, 25, 22, 24, 26]`\n* Calculate the median of a list of stock prices: `[100, 120, 90, 110, 130]`",
