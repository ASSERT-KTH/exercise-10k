  "prompt": "Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs, where each key is a name and each value is an age",
  "answer": "Here is a Python dictionary with 5 key-value pairs, where each key is a name and each value is an age:\n\n```python\npeople = {\n    \"John\": 25,\n    \"Emily\": 30,\n    \"Michael\": 35,\n    \"Sarah\": 20,\n    \"William\": 40\n}\n```\n\nYou can access and manipulate this dictionary like any other Python dictionary. For example, you can print out the age of a specific person like this:\n\n```python\nprint(people[\"John\"])  # Outputs: 25\n```\n\nOr you can iterate over the dictionary to print out all the names and ages:\n\n```python\nfor name, age in people.items():\n    print(f\"{name} is {age} years old.\")\n```",
