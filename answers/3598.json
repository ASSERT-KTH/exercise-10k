  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(speed, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.\n\n    Args:\n        speed (float): The speed of the object in meters per second.\n        time (float): The time traveled in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance traveled in meters.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = speed * time\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Distance Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed in meters per second: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \"))\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)\n\n    print(f\"The distance traveled is {distance} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the distance traveled by a car moving at 50 meters per second for 10 seconds.\n* Calculate the distance traveled by a person walking at 2 meters per second for 5 seconds.\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `distance_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python distance_calculator.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the speed and time.\n5. The program will display the calculated distance.\n\n**Formula**\n----------\n\nThe formula used to calculate the distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nThis formula is based on the definition of speed as the rate of change of distance with respect to time. By multiplying the speed by the time, we can calculate the total distance traveled.",
