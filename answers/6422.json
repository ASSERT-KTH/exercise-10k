  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The game continues to ask for guesses until the correct number is guessed.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the code.\n2. The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The game uses a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until the correct number is guessed.\n* The game checks if the user's input is a valid integer and if it's within the correct range.\n* The game provides feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.",
