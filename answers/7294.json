  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\nHere's an example of a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"List must only contain numbers\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The function `calculate_average` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of these numbers.\n*   It first checks if the input is a list and if it's not empty. If either condition is not met, it raises a `TypeError` or `ValueError` accordingly.\n*   It then checks if all elements in the list are numbers. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n*   Finally, it calculates the average by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use this function with a list of numbers and handle potential errors that may occur.",
