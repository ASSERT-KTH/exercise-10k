  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reversed array. The function should not use any built-in reverse functions.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, here is the code that meets the requirements:\n```\ndef reverse_array(arr):\n    start = 0\n    end = len(arr) - 1\n    while start < end:\n        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n    return arr\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(reverse_array(arr))\n```\nThis code defines a function `reverse_array` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reversed array. The function uses a two-pointer technique to swap elements from the start and end of the array, moving towards the center. The `while` loop continues until the `start` pointer is no longer less than the `end` pointer. The function then returns the reversed array.\n\nThe code also includes an example usage of the function, where an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is passed to the function and the reversed array is printed to the console. The expected output is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.",
