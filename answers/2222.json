  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses list comprehension to filter a list of numbers and return only the even numbers:\n\n```python\ndef get_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of even numbers from the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of even integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `get_even_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and uses list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the even numbers. The expression `num % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even by verifying that the remainder of the division by 2 is 0. The resulting list of even numbers is then returned by the function.\n\nWhen you run this program with the example list of numbers, it will output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.",
