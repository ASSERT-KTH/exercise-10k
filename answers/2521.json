  "answer": "**QuickSort Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an implementation of the QuickSort algorithm in Python, which sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the QuickSort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [35, 2, 1, 45, 5, 3]\n    sorted_numbers = quicksort(numbers)\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n--------------------\n\n1.  The `quicksort` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list.\n2.  If the length of the input list is 1 or less, it is already sorted, so the function returns the list as is.\n3.  The function selects a pivot element from the list (in this case, the middle element).\n4.  It then creates three lists:\n\n    *   `left`: contains elements less than the pivot.\n    *   `middle`: contains elements equal to the pivot.\n    *   `right`: contains elements greater than the pivot.\n5.  The function recursively sorts the `left` and `right` lists and concatenates the results with the `middle` list to produce the final sorted list.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-----------------\n\nThe average-case time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm is O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets. However, in the worst case (when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), the time complexity can be O(n^2).\n\n**Space Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe space complexity of the QuickSort algorithm is O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. However, the implementation above uses extra space to store the `left`, `middle`, and `right` lists, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).",
