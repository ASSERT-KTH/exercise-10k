  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. It generates a random choice for the computer and determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"User\"\n    return \"Computer\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n\n    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    if winner == \"Tie\":\n        print(f\"It's a tie! Both chose {user_choice}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The {winner} wins!\")\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will generate a random choice for the computer and determine the winner.\n4. The result will be displayed, and you will be asked if you want to play again.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `get_computer_choice` function to generate a random choice for the computer.\n* The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n* The `play_game` function plays a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\n* The `main` function runs the game in a loop until the user chooses to quit.",
