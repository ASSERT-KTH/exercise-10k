  "answer": "### Repeating a String\n#### Description\nThis program will ask the user for a string and an integer, then print out the string repeated that many times.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef repeat_string():\n    # Ask the user for a string\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Ask the user for an integer\n    while True:\n        try:\n            repeat_count = int(input(\"Please enter the number of times to repeat the string: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Print out the string repeated that many times\n    print((user_string + \" \") * repeat_count).strip()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    repeat_string()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The program defines a function `repeat_string` that contains the main logic.\n2. It asks the user for a string using the built-in `input` function.\n3. It asks the user for an integer and checks if the input is a valid whole number. If not, it will keep asking until a valid input is provided.\n4. It prints out the string repeated that many times using the `*` operator, which repeats the string. The `strip` method is used to remove the trailing space.\n\n#### Running the Code\nTo run the code, save it to a file (e.g., `repeat_string.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python repeat_string.py`). Follow the prompts to enter a string and an integer. The program will then print out the string repeated that many times.",
