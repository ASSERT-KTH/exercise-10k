  "answer": "**Sorting an Array in Ascending Order**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that uses the built-in sorting function to sort an array in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(arr)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = sort_array(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n\n1. The `sort_array` function takes an array `arr` as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the array in ascending order.\n3. The sorted array is returned.\n4. In the example usage, an array `arr` is created and printed.\n5. The `sort_array` function is called with `arr` as input, and the sorted array is printed.\n\n**Output**\n\n```\nOriginal array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n\nIf you want to implement a sorting algorithm from scratch, you can use a simple algorithm like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort. Here's an example of Bubble Sort:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array in ascending order using Bubble Sort.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is less efficient than the built-in sorting function for large arrays. However, it can be useful for educational purposes or for small arrays where simplicity is more important than performance.",
