  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and reverses the order of its elements. The program should then print the reversed array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n\n    vector<int> v(n);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cin >> v[i];\n    }\n\n    reverse(v.begin(), v.end());\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cout << v[i] << \" \";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification to ensure that the code matches the requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
