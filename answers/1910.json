  "prompt": "Calculate the acceleration given the change in speed and time.",
  "answer": "To calculate acceleration, we can use the following formula:\n\nAcceleration (a) = Change in speed (\u0394v) / Time (t)\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as:\n\na = \u0394v / t\n\nWhere:\n- a is the acceleration\n- \u0394v is the change in speed (final speed - initial speed)\n- t is the time over which the change in speed occurs\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to know the values of \u0394v and t. Can you provide these values?",
