  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the user's year of birth based on their age and the current year.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the year of birth based on the user's age and the current year.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n\ndef calculate_year_of_birth():\n    # Get the current year\n    current_year = date.today().year\n\n    # Ask the user for their age\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the year of birth\n    year_of_birth = current_year - age\n\n    print(f\"Based on your age, your year of birth is: {year_of_birth}\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_year_of_birth()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*   We use the `date.today().year` function from the `datetime` module to get the current year.\n*   The user is asked to enter their age, which is converted to an integer.\n*   The year of birth is calculated by subtracting the user's age from the current year.\n*   Finally, the calculated year of birth is printed out to the user.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter your age. If you enter `30`, for example, and the current year is `2024`, the program will calculate your year of birth as `2024 - 30 = 1994` and print out `Based on your age, your year of birth is: 1994`.",
