  "prompt": "Write a program that declares variables using different naming conventions (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, etc.) and prints their values.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# System Variables\nsystemVar = 10\nprint(\"System Variables: \", systemVar)\n\n# Camel Case Variables\ncamelCaseVar = 20\nprint(\"Camel Case Variables: \", camelCaseVar)\n\n# Snake Case Variables\nsnake_case_var = 30\nprint(\"Snake Case Variables: \", snake_case_var)\n\n# Pascal Case Variables\npascalCaseVar = 40\nprint(\"Pascal Case Variables: \", pascalCaseVar)\n```\nThis code defines four variables with different naming conventions and prints their values to the console. Each variable is assigned a unique value, and the `print()` function is used to output the variable name and its value. The code does not use any external libraries or modules and is a simple Python script.",
