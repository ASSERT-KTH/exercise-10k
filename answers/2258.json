  "answer": "**Calculating Average of Numbers**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of a series of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculate_average` with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Calculate the average of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`\n* Calculate the average of temperatures: `[25, 30, 28, 22, 26]`\n* Calculate the average of stock prices: `[100, 120, 110, 130, 105]`\n\nYou can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
