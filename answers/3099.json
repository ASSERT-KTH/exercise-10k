  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings. It iterates through the characters of the first string in the list and checks if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. Iterate through the characters of the shortest string.\n4. For each character, check if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings.\n5. If a mismatch is found, return the prefix up to the mismatched character.\n6. If no mismatch is found after iterating through all characters, return the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the list. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we need to iterate through all characters of the shortest string and compare them with all other strings.",
