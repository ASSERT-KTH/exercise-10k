  "answer": "Here's a Python program that counts down from a given number using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef countdown(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts down from n to 1, printing each number on a new line.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The starting number for the countdown.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(f\"Counting down from {n}:\")\ncountdown(n)\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Function definition**: The `countdown` function is defined, which takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. **Loop setup**: The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1 (since the stop value is exclusive and we use a step of `-1` for a descending sequence).\n3. **Loop execution**: The `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n4. **Printing**: Inside the loop, the current number `i` is printed to the console.\n5. **Example usage**: An example is provided where `n` is set to 10, and the `countdown` function is called with this value, demonstrating the countdown functionality.",
