  "answer": "**Modulus Operator Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThe following program demonstrates the use of the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of a division operation. It takes two integers as input, divides the first by the second, and prints the quotient and remainder.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of a division operation.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    quotient, remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_remainder` function takes two integers as input: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2. It calculates the quotient using integer division (`//`).\n3. It calculates the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculate_remainder` with an example.\n5. The program prints the quotient and remainder of the division operation.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2\n```\n\nThis program showcases the use of the modulus operator to find the remainder of a division operation, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics and programming.",
