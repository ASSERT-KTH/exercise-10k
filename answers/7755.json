  "prompt": "Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The function should take a string as input and return True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive and ignore non-alphanumeric characters.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a solution to check if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and considering case sensitivity. This solution will provide a clear, step-by-step approach to achieve the desired outcome. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a palindrome. The function is case-insensitive and ignores non-alphanumeric characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we convert the string to lower case to make the function case-insensitive\n    s = s.lower()\n\n    # Then, we filter out non-alphanumeric characters from the string\n    # We use a list comprehension to create a new string with only alphanumeric characters\n    s = ''.join(char for char in s if char.isalnum())\n\n    # Now, we compare the filtered string with its reverse\n    # If they are equal, the string is a palindrome\n    # We use slicing to reverse the string, which is a common Python idiom\n    return s == s[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_palindrome` starts by converting the input string `s` to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure case-insensitivity.\n* It then filters out non-alphanumeric characters from the string `s` using a list comprehension and the `isalnum()` method, joining the remaining characters back into a string.\n* The function compares the filtered string `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`) to determine if it's a palindrome, returning `True` if they match and `False` otherwise.\n* This approach effectively ignores non-alphanumeric characters and handles case sensitivity, providing a robust solution for checking palindromes.",
