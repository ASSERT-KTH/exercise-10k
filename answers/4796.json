  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if two input words are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two words are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        word1 (str): The first word.\n        word2 (str): The second word.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the words are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both words to lowercase and remove any whitespace\n    word1 = word1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    word2 = word2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if the sorted letters of both words are equal\n    return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    word1 = \"listen\"\n    word2 = \"silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{word1}' and '{word2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(word1, word2)}\")\n\n    word1 = \"hello\"\n    word2 = \"world\"\n    print(f\"Are '{word1}' and '{word2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(word1, word2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two words as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It first removes any whitespace from the words and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It then sorts the letters of both words and checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, the words are anagrams.\n4. The `main` function provides example usage of the `are_anagrams` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking if two words are anagrams in a word game or puzzle.\n* Validating user input to ensure that two words are anagrams.\n* Generating anagrams for a given word or phrase.",
