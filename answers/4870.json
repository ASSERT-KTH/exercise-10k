  "answer": "**Coin Toss Simulator**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates 100 coin tosses using a for loop and counts the number of heads and tails.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_toss_simulator(num_tosses):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a specified number of coin tosses and returns the count of heads and tails.\n\n    Args:\n        num_tosses (int): The number of coin tosses to simulate.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the count of heads and tails.\n    \"\"\"\n    heads = 0\n    tails = 0\n\n    for _ in range(num_tosses):\n        # Generate a random number (0 or 1) to represent the coin toss\n        toss = random.randint(0, 1)\n        \n        # If the toss is 0, it's tails; otherwise, it's heads\n        if toss == 0:\n            tails += 1\n        else:\n            heads += 1\n\n    return heads, tails\n\ndef main():\n    num_tosses = 100\n    heads, tails = coin_toss_simulator(num_tosses)\n\n    print(f\"Simulated {num_tosses} coin tosses.\")\n    print(f\"Heads: {heads}\")\n    print(f\"Tails: {tails}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nSimulated 100 coin tosses.\nHeads: 53\nTails: 47\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `coin_toss_simulator` function takes the number of coin tosses as input and initializes counters for heads and tails.\n2. The function uses a for loop to simulate each coin toss by generating a random number (0 or 1) using `random.randint(0, 1)`.\n3. If the random number is 0, it increments the tails counter; otherwise, it increments the heads counter.\n4. The function returns the counts of heads and tails as a tuple.\n5. In the `main` function, we call `coin_toss_simulator` with 100 coin tosses and print the results.",
