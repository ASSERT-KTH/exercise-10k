  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that generates a random number and lets the user guess it, providing hints along the way.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program reveals the correct answer and ends.\n4. The program tries to convert the user's guess to an integer. If this fails (because the user typed something that isn't a number), it prints an error message and asks for another guess.\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends.\n6. If the user's guess is too low or too high, the program provides a hint and asks for another guess.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and try to guess the number by typing different numbers.\n* Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n* Try typing something that isn't a number to see the error message.",
