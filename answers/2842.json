  "prompt": "Write a function to retrieve the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function to retrieve a value associated with a given key from a dictionary, making it easier to access and manage dictionary data. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef retrieve_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key (any): The key to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the key if found, None otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input is not a dictionary.\")\n\n    # Then, we check if the key exists in the dictionary\n    # We use the 'in' keyword to check for key existence\n    if key in dictionary:\n        # If the key exists, we return its associated value\n        # We use the 'get' method to retrieve the value\n        # This method returns None if the key does not exist, but we've already checked for that\n        return dictionary.get(key)\n    else:\n        # If the key does not exist, we return None\n        # This could be changed to raise an exception or handle the situation in some other way\n        return None\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(retrieve_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Outputs: John\nprint(retrieve_value(my_dict, \"age\"))   # Outputs: 30\nprint(retrieve_value(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Outputs: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `retrieve_value` starts by validating if the provided `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary, raising a `TypeError` if it's not. This ensures the function operates on the correct data type.\n* It then checks if the specified `key` exists within the `dictionary` using the `in` keyword, which returns `True` if the key is found and `False` otherwise.\n* If the `key` is found, the function uses the `get` method of the `dictionary` to retrieve and return the associated value. If the `key` is not found, it returns `None`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `retrieve_value` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, showing how it correctly retrieves values for existing keys and returns `None` for non-existent keys.",
