  "answer": "### Searching for a Substring within a Larger String\n#### Function Description\n\nThis function, `find_substring`, searches for a given substring within a larger string. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, and -1 otherwise.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(larger_string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a given substring within a larger string.\n\n    Args:\n    larger_string (str): The string to search in.\n    substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the str.find() method to find the substring\n        index = larger_string.find(substring)\n        return index\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any exceptions that may occur\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    larger_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    substring = \"World\"\n    result = find_substring(larger_string, substring)\n    \n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"The substring '{substring}' was found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The substring '{substring}' was not found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `find_substring` takes two arguments: `larger_string` and `substring`.\n2. It uses the built-in `str.find()` method to search for the `substring` within the `larger_string`.\n3. If the `substring` is found, `str.find()` returns the index of the first occurrence.\n4. If the `substring` is not found, `str.find()` returns -1.\n5. The function includes error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during execution.\n6. The example usage in the `main` function demonstrates how to use `find_substring` with a sample larger string and substring.",
