  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a copy of the dictionary.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that duplicates a given dictionary, ensuring that the original dictionary remains unchanged. This function will be useful when you need to modify a dictionary without affecting the original data. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef copy_dictionary(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a copy of the input dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be copied.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A copy of the input dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    # We use the built-in dict.copy() method to create a shallow copy of the dictionary\n    # This method returns a new dictionary object which is a copy of the original dictionary\n    copied_dict = input_dict.copy()\n\n    # Finally, we return the copied dictionary\n    return copied_dict\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\ncopied_dict = copy_dictionary(original_dict)\nprint(copied_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `copy_dictionary` starts by validating the input using `isinstance(input_dict, dict)`, ensuring that it's indeed a dictionary. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes the built-in `dict.copy()` method to create a shallow copy of the input dictionary, which is stored in the `copied_dict` variable.\n* This copied dictionary is then returned by the function, providing a duplicate of the original dictionary.\n* Note that this function creates a shallow copy, meaning it doesn't recursively copy nested objects like lists or dictionaries. For a deep copy, consider using the `copy` module from Python's standard library.",
