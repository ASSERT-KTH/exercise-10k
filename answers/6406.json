  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. It uses if/else statements to determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's random choice.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        \n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        \n        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        print(result)\n        \n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again == \"no\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).\n2. The computer will generate a random choice and display both choices.\n3. The program will determine the winner based on the game's rules and display the result.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter \"yes\" to play another round or \"no\" to exit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not include any error handling for invalid user input beyond checking for valid choices.",
