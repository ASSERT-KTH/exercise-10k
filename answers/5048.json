  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the median of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate median of an empty list\")\n\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle number\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        median = numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers\n    else:\n        median = (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n\n    return median\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [12, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 15]\nmedian = calculate_median(numbers)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `calculate_median` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median. The function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, raises a `ValueError`. Then it sorts the list in ascending order and calculates the median based on whether the length of the list is odd or even.\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1.  **Sorting the List:** The program starts by sorting the input list in ascending order using the `sort` method. This is necessary because the median is the middle value in the sorted list.\n2.  **Calculating the Median:** After sorting the list, the program checks if the length of the list is odd or even using the modulus operator (`n % 2 == 1`). If the length is odd, the median is the middle number, which is accessed using the index `n // 2`. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which are accessed using the indices `n // 2 - 1` and `n // 2`.\n3.  **Returning the Median:** Finally, the program returns the calculated median.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nThe program includes an example usage at the end, where it calculates the median of the list `[12, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 15]`. The output of the program is the median of the input list, which is printed to the console.",
