  "answer": "**Secret Number Guessing Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a random secret number and lets the user guess it until they get it right.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef main():\n    # Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of guesses\n    num_guesses = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the secret number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the secret number was {}.\".format(secret_number))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of guesses\n        num_guesses += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {} guesses.\".format(num_guesses))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random secret number between 1 and 100.\n3. You will be prompted to take a guess.\n4. Enter a whole number to guess the secret number.\n5. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n6. Keep guessing until you get the secret number right.\n7. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the secret number.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they get the secret number right.\n* The program generates a random secret number using the `random.randint` function.\n* The program checks if the user's guess is an integer using a `try`-`except` block. If the input is not a valid integer, the program will ask the user to try again.",
