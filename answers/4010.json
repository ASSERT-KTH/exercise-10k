  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a While Loop**\n======================================================\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers():\n    # Initialize the counter variable\n    i = 1\n    \n    # Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10\n    while i <= 10:\n        print(i)\n        # Increment the counter variable\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_numbers()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `print_numbers` function initializes a counter variable `i` to 1.\n2. The while loop checks if `i` is less than or equal to 10. If true, it prints the current value of `i`.\n3. After printing `i`, the loop increments `i` by 1 using `i += 1`.\n4. The loop repeats steps 2-3 until `i` exceeds 10.\n\n**Running the Program**\n---------------------\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `print_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python print_numbers.py`). The program will print the numbers from 1 to 10.",
