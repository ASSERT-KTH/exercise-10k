  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a star pattern of a given size:\n\n```python\ndef print_star_pattern(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a star pattern of a given size.\n\n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the star pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size - i - 1):\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    size = int(input(\"Enter the size of the star pattern: \"))\n    print_star_pattern(size)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Enter `5` when prompted to print a star pattern of size 5:\n\n    ```\n    Enter the size of the star pattern: 5\n         *\n        ***\n       *****\n      *******\n     *********\n    ```\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1.  The `print_star_pattern` function takes an integer `size` as input, representing the size of the star pattern.\n2.  The outer loop (`for i in range(size)`) iterates over each row of the star pattern.\n3.  The first inner loop (`for j in range(size - i - 1)`) prints spaces to align the stars correctly. The number of spaces decreases by 1 for each row.\n4.  The second inner loop (`for k in range(2 * i + 1)`) prints the stars. The number of stars increases by 2 for each row, starting from 1 star in the first row.\n5.  The `main` function asks the user to enter the size of the star pattern and calls the `print_star_pattern` function to print the pattern.\n\n### Running the Code:\n\nTo run this code, save it in a Python file, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and execute the file using Python (e.g., `python star_pattern.py`). Follow the prompt to enter the size of the star pattern.",
