  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n\n# Test the function\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of its digits is:\", sum_of_digits(number))\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The function `sum_of_digits(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It converts the integer into a string so that each digit can be iterated over.\n3. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string, convert it back into an integer, and sum all these integers together.\n4. The result is then returned by the function.\n5. The user is prompted to enter a number, which is passed to the `sum_of_digits` function, and the result is printed out.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Input: `12345`\n  - Output: `15` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)\n- Input: `999`\n  - Output: `27` (because 9 + 9 + 9 = 27)",
