  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the most frequent element in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem. This program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the array. It then returns the key with the maximum value in the dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef most_frequent(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the most frequent element in an array of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The most frequent number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the list to count the frequency of each element\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in frequency:\n            frequency[num] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[num] = 1\n    \n    # Find the key with the maximum value in the dictionary\n    most_frequent_num = max(frequency, key=frequency.get)\n    \n    return most_frequent_num\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(most_frequent(numbers))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because it makes a single pass over the list to count the frequency of each element, and then uses the built-in `max` function to find the key with the maximum value in the dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to simplify the code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the most frequent element in an array of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The most frequent number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a Counter object to count the frequency of each element\n    frequency = Counter(nums)\n    \n    # Find the key with the maximum value in the Counter object\n    most_frequent_num = frequency.most_common(1)[0][0]\n    \n    return most_frequent_num\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(most_frequent(numbers))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis version of the program has the same time complexity as the previous one, but it uses the `Counter` class to count the frequency of each element, which makes the code more concise and easier to read.",
