  "prompt": "Write a program that uses an if/else statement to determine the winner of a game of rock, paper, scissors.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a rock, paper, scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works:\n1. The `game` function contains a while loop to allow the user to play multiple rounds.\n2. Inside the loop, it prompts the user for their choice and checks if the input is valid. If not, it keeps asking for input until a valid choice is made.\n3. The computer's choice is selected randomly from the list of possible choices.\n4. It then prints out both the user's and computer's choices.\n5. The if/else statement determines the winner based on the game's rules:\n   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.\n   - If the user chose rock and the computer chose scissors, or if the user chose paper and the computer chose rock, or if the user chose scissors and the computer chose paper, the user wins.\n   - Otherwise, the computer wins.\n6. After each round, it asks the user if they want to play again. If they choose not to, the program ends.",
