  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input and then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should then be printed to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle\n\n# Get input from the user\nlength = int(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = int(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n# Define a function to calculate the area\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\n# Define a function to calculate the perimeter\ndef rectangle_perimeter(length, width):\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Calculate the area and perimeter\narea = rectangle_area(length, width)\nperimeter = rectangle_perimeter(length, width)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"The area of the rectangle is:\", area)\nprint(\"The perimeter of the rectangle is:\", perimeter)\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly, including the input prompts, function definitions, and print statements. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
