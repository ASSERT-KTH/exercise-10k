  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks whether a number is prime or not:\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Ask the user for a number and print whether it's prime.\"\"\"\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks whether a number `n` is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n3. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`, so we use `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` as the upper limit.\n4. We iterate from 2 to the upper limit and check if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, we return `False`.\n5. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so we return `True`.\n6. In the `main` function, we ask the user for a number, check whether it's prime using the `is_prime` function, and print the result.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Enter a number: 25\nOutput: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Enter a number: 23\nOutput: 23 is a prime number.\n* Enter a number: 37\nOutput: 37 is a prime number.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized numbers. For larger numbers, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.",
