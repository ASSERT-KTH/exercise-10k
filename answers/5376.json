  "answer": "**List Difference Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the difference of two or more lists. The difference of two lists A and B is defined as the elements that are in A but not in B.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef list_difference(*lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the difference of two or more lists.\n\n    Args:\n        *lists: Variable number of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of elements that are in the first list but not in any of the other lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lists:\n        return []\n\n    diff = set(lists[0])\n    for lst in lists[1:]:\n        diff -= set(lst)\n\n    return list(diff)\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nlist3 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nprint(\"List 1:\", list1)\nprint(\"List 2:\", list2)\nprint(\"List 3:\", list3)\n\nprint(\"Difference of List 1 and List 2:\", list_difference(list1, list2))\nprint(\"Difference of List 1, List 2, and List 3:\", list_difference(list1, list2, list3))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `list_difference` function takes a variable number of lists as arguments.\n*   It converts the first list to a set and then subtracts the sets of the other lists from it.\n*   The resulting set is converted back to a list and returned.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `list_difference` function with two and three lists.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nList 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nList 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nList 3: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nDifference of List 1 and List 2: [1, 2, 3]\nDifference of List 1, List 2, and List 3: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the lists contain hashable elements (e.g., integers, strings, tuples). If the lists contain unhashable elements (e.g., lists, dictionaries), you may need to use a different approach.",
