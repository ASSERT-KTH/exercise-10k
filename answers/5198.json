  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a message and then responds with a pre-defined response based on the user's input.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_message():\n    \"\"\"Get user message.\"\"\"\n    user_message = input(\"Please enter a message: \")\n    return user_message\n\ndef generate_response(message):\n    \"\"\"Generate response based on user message.\"\"\"\n    responses = {\n        \"hello\": \"Hi, how are you?\",\n        \"how are you\": \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\",\n        \"what's your name\": \"I'm an AI, I don't have a name.\",\n        \"default\": \"Sorry, I didn't understand that.\"\n    }\n    \n    # Convert user message to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    message = message.lower()\n    \n    # Check if user message matches any of the predefined responses\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in message:\n            return responses[key]\n    \n    # Return default response if no match found\n    return responses[\"default\"]\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    user_message = get_user_message()\n    response = generate_response(user_message)\n    print(\"Response: \", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `get_user_message()` function prompts the user to enter a message using the `input()` function and returns the user's input.\n2. The `generate_response()` function takes the user's message as input and checks if it matches any of the predefined responses.\n3. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding response. Otherwise, it returns a default response.\n4. The `main()` function coordinates the entire process by calling `get_user_message()` to get the user's input, `generate_response()` to generate a response, and then prints the response.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* User enters \"hello\": Program responds with \"Hi, how are you?\".\n* User enters \"how are you\": Program responds with \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\".\n* User enters \"what's your name\": Program responds with \"I'm an AI, I don't have a name.\".\n* User enters anything else: Program responds with \"Sorry, I didn't understand that.\".",
