  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # Check for divisors up to the square root of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If a divisor is found, the number is not prime\n            return False\n    # If no divisors are found, the number is prime\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_prime(25))  # False\n    print(is_prime(23))  # True\n    print(is_prime(37))  # True\n    print(is_prime(48))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `False`, as these numbers are not prime.\n3. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.\n4. If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`.\n5. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This function uses a simple trial division method, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized inputs.\n* For larger inputs, more efficient algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.\n* Always consider the input range and potential performance requirements when choosing an algorithm.",
