  "answer": "**Uncommon Characters Function**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python function to find the uncommon characters between two given strings. This function uses Python's built-in set data structure to find the uncommon characters.\n\n```python\ndef find_uncommon_chars(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the uncommon characters between two given strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of uncommon characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the strings to sets of characters\n    set1 = set(str1)\n    set2 = set(str2)\n\n    # Use set difference to find the uncommon characters\n    uncommon_chars = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n\n    return uncommon_chars\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"abcde\"\n    str2 = \"acefg\"\n    uncommon_chars = find_uncommon_chars(str1, str2)\n    print(\"Uncommon characters:\", uncommon_chars)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `find_uncommon_chars` function takes two strings as input.\n2. It converts each string to a set of characters using the `set()` function.\n3. It uses the `symmetric_difference()` method to find the uncommon characters between the two sets. This method returns a new set with elements in either the set on the left or the right, but not both.\n4. The function returns the set of uncommon characters.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* The order of characters in the output set is not guaranteed, as sets are unordered in Python.\n* This function considers uppercase and lowercase characters as distinct. If you want to ignore case, you can convert both strings to lowercase or uppercase before finding the uncommon characters.",
