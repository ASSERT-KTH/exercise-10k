  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should have a specified number of rows, and each row should have a number of asterisks equal to the row number. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program should print a pattern with 5 rows, where the first row has 1 asterisk, the second row has 2 asterisks, and so on.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n// input: 5\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, i, j;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {\n            printf(\"%d\", j);\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer `n` from the standard input, then uses two nested loops to print the pattern. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and the inner loop prints the numbers from 1 to the current row number `i`. The `printf(\"\\n\")` statement after the inner loop prints a newline character at the end of each row.",
