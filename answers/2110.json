  "answer": "**Getting Dictionary Keys**\n==========================\n\nYou can use the built-in `keys()` method in Python to get a list of all keys in a dictionary.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_dict_keys(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all keys in the input dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to extract keys from.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionary keys.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(input_dict.keys())\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nkeys = get_dict_keys(my_dict)\nprint(keys)  # Output: ['name', 'age', 'city']\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `keys()` method returns a view object that displays a list of all keys in the dictionary.\n*   We convert this view object to a list using the `list()` function.\n*   The resulting list is then returned by the `get_dict_keys` function.\n\nNote that dictionary keys are inherently unordered in Python versions before 3.7. However, in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain their insertion order, so the order of keys in the output list will match the order in which they were inserted into the dictionary.",
