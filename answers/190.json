  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using a for loop. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns False.\n3. The function uses a for loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns False.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so the function returns True.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23, to see the program confirm that it is prime.\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 24, to see the program confirm that it is not prime.\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0 or 1, to see the program confirm that it is not prime.",
