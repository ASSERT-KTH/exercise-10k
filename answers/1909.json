  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and the time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed of an object given the distance and time.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object in meters.\n        time (float): The time taken by the object to travel the distance in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time must be greater than zero\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in meters: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken in seconds: \"))\n\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed of the object is {speed:.2f} meters per second\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_speed` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `time`.\n2. It checks if the `time` is less than or equal to zero and raises a `ValueError` if true.\n3. It calculates the speed by dividing the `distance` by the `time`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_speed` function by taking user input for distance and time.\n5. It calls the `calculate_speed` function and prints the result with two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the speed of a car that travels 100 meters in 10 seconds.\n* Calculate the speed of a runner who covers 400 meters in 60 seconds.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the distance and time are given in meters and seconds, respectively. If you want to use different units, you will need to adjust the program accordingly.",
