  "prompt": "Write a program that initializes multiple variables in a single line of code.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that initializes multiple variables in a single line of code:\n\n```python\n# Initialize multiple variables in a single line\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n\n# Print the values of the variables\nprint(\"Value of a:\", a)\nprint(\"Value of b:\", b)\nprint(\"Value of c:\", c)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nValue of a: 1\nValue of b: 2\nValue of c: 3\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how you can initialize multiple variables in a single line of code using Python's tuple unpacking feature. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively, in a single line of code.",
