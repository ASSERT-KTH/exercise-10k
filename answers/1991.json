  "answer": "**Arithmetic Operations Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program will perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on the user's choice.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operations():\n    print(\"Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \"))\n\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    if choice == 1:\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    elif choice == 2:\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    elif choice == 3:\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    elif choice == 4:\n        if num2 != 0:\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\ndef main():\n    arithmetic_operations()\n    while True:\n        cont = input(\"Do you want to continue? (y/n): \")\n        if cont.lower() == 'y':\n            arithmetic_operations()\n        elif cont.lower() == 'n':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter y or n.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The program defines a function `arithmetic_operations()` that:\n   * Prints a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.\n   * Prompts the user to enter their choice, first number, and second number.\n   * Uses conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice.\n   * Prints the result of the operation.\n\n2. The `main()` function:\n   * Calls `arithmetic_operations()` to start the program.\n   * Asks the user if they want to continue after each operation.\n   * If the user chooses to continue, it calls `arithmetic_operations()` again.\n   * If the user chooses to stop, it breaks the loop and ends the program.\n\n3. The program uses a `while` loop to allow the user to perform multiple operations without having to restart the program.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Addition: Choose option 1, enter two numbers (e.g., 5 and 3), and the program will print the result (5 + 3 = 8).\n* Subtraction: Choose option 2, enter two numbers (e.g., 10 and 4), and the program will print the result (10 - 4 = 6).\n* Multiplication: Choose option 3, enter two numbers (e.g., 7 and 2), and the program will print the result (7 * 2 = 14).\n* Division: Choose option 4, enter two numbers (e.g., 9 and 3), and the program will print the result (9 / 3 = 3.0). If the user tries to divide by zero, the program will print an error message.",
