  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, reverses the order of the elements, and then doubles the value of each element. The program should output the modified list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef reverse_and_double(lst):\n    lst.reverse()\n    return [x * 2 for x in lst]\n\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(reverse_and_double(lst))\n```\nThis code defines the `reverse_and_double` function, which takes a list `lst` as input, reverses it in place using the `reverse()` method, and then uses a list comprehension to create a new list with each element doubled. The result is returned by the function.\n\nThe code then defines a sample list `lst` containing the integers 1 through 5, and calls the `reverse_and_double` function with this list as input. The output is printed to the console using the `print()` function.\n\nWhen run, this code will output the list `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`, which is the reversed and doubled version of the original list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.",
