  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\ndef concat_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"Concatenates two arrays into one.\"\"\"\n    return arr1 + arr2\n\n# Example usage:\narray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narray2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult = concat_arrays(array1, array2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\nThis code defines a function `concat_arrays` that takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and returns the resulting array. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with two sample arrays and print the result.",
