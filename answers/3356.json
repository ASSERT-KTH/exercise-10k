The program starts by choosing a random word from a predefined list.\n2. The player is presented with a series of underscores representing the word.\n3. The player can guess a letter or the entire word.\n4. If the player guesses a letter, the program checks if the letter is in the word. If it is, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the letter. If not, the player loses a try.\n5. If the player guesses the word, they win.\n6. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of tries.\n7. After each guess, the program displays the current state of the hangman's gallows, with the number of tries remaining.",
