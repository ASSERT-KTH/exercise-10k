  "answer": "**Calculating the Slope of a Line**\n=====================================\n\nThe slope of a line can be calculated using the formula: `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`, where `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are two points on the line.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n-----------------------\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the slope of a line:\n```python\ndef calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the slope of a line given two points.\n\n    Args:\n        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.\n        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.\n        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.\n        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The slope of the line.\n    \"\"\"\n    if x2 - x1 == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Vertical line detected. Slope is undefined.\")\n    slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n    return slope\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    try:\n        slope = calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n        print(f\"The slope of the line is: {slope}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**How the Code Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_slope` function takes in the coordinates of two points and calculates the slope using the formula.\n2. The function checks if the line is vertical (i.e., `x2 - x1 == 0`) and raises a `ValueError` if so, since the slope is undefined for vertical lines.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the coordinates of two points and calls the `calculate_slope` function to calculate the slope.\n4. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n-----------------------\n\n* Calculate the slope of a line passing through points (2, 3) and (4, 5):\n\t+ Input: `x1 = 2`, `y1 = 3`, `x2 = 4`, `y2 = 5`\n\t+ Output: `The slope of the line is: 1.0`\n* Calculate the slope of a vertical line passing through points (1, 2) and (1, 4):\n\t+ Input: `x1 = 1`, `y1 = 2`, `x2 = 1`, `y2 = 4`\n\t+ Output: `Vertical line detected. Slope is undefined.`",
