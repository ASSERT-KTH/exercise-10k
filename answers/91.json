  "answer": "**Partitioning an Array Around a Pivot Element**\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a two-pointer approach to partition the array.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef partition_array(nums, pivot):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition the array such that all elements less than the pivot come before all elements greater than the pivot.\n\n    Args:\n    - nums (list): A list of integers.\n    - pivot (int): The pivot element.\n\n    Returns:\n    - list: The partitioned array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize two pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the array\n    while right < len(nums):\n        # If the current element is less than the pivot, swap it with the left pointer\n        if nums[right] < pivot:\n            nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]\n            left += 1\n        right += 1\n\n    return nums\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [7, 9, 4, 2, 5, 8, 1, 6, 3]\npivot = 5\nprint(\"Original array:\", nums)\nprint(\"Pivot:\", pivot)\nprint(\"Partitioned array:\", partition_array(nums, pivot))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning of the array.\n*   We iterate over the array with the `right` pointer. If the current element is less than the pivot, we swap it with the element at the `left` pointer and increment `left`.\n*   We continue this process until we have iterated over the entire array.\n*   The resulting array will have all elements less than the pivot on the left and all elements greater than the pivot on the right.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since we make a single pass over the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and do not allocate any additional space.",
