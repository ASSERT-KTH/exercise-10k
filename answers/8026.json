  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite hobby. The program should then output a customized message that includes the user's name, age, and hobby, and also generates a random lottery number between 1 and 100. The output message should be in the format: 'Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and enjoy {hobby}. Your lucky lottery number is: {lotto_number}'.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\nimport random\n\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    hobby = input(\"Enter your favorite hobby: \")\n\n    lottery_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and enjoy {hobby}. Your lucky lottery number is: {lottery_number}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code imports the `random` module, defines a `main` function that prompts the user for input, generates a random lottery number, and prints a customized message. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.",
