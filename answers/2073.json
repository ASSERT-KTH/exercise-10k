  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the longest substring of a given string that contains only unique characters.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that utilizes a sliding window approach with a set to efficiently track unique characters in the current substring.\n\n```python\ndef longest_unique_substring(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest substring of a given string that contains only unique characters.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring with unique characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the longest substring and its length\n    longest_substring = \"\"\n    max_length = 0\n\n    # Initialize a set to store unique characters in the current substring\n    unique_chars = set()\n\n    # Initialize the left pointer of the sliding window\n    left = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the string with the right pointer of the sliding window\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        # While the current character is in the set, remove the leftmost character from the set and move the left pointer\n        while s[right] in unique_chars:\n            unique_chars.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n\n        # Add the current character to the set\n        unique_chars.add(s[right])\n\n        # Update the longest substring if the current substring is longer\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            longest_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return longest_substring\n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_unique_substring(\"abcabcbb\"))  # Output: \"abc\"\nprint(longest_unique_substring(\"bbbbb\"))  # Output: \"b\"\nprint(longest_unique_substring(\"pwwkew\"))  # Output: \"wke\"\nprint(longest_unique_substring(\"\"))  # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   The `longest_unique_substring` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest substring with unique characters.\n*   It uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, `left` and `right`, to track the current substring.\n*   A set `unique_chars` is used to store unique characters in the current substring, allowing for efficient lookups and insertions.\n*   The function iterates over the string with the `right` pointer and updates the `left` pointer and the set as necessary to maintain a substring with unique characters.\n*   It keeps track of the longest substring seen so far and returns it at the end.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because each character is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the set used to store unique characters.",
