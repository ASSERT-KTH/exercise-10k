  "answer": "Escape Sequences in Strings\n==========================\n\nEscape sequences are used to represent special characters in strings. They are preceded by a backslash (`\\`) and are used to insert characters that have special meanings in a string.\n\n### Common Escape Sequences\n\nHere are some common escape sequences:\n\n* `\\\\` - Backslash\n* `\\'` - Single quote\n* `\\\"` - Double quote\n* `\\n` - New line\n* `\\t` - Tab\n* `\\r` - Carriage return\n* `\\b` - Backspace\n* `\\f` - Form feed\n* `\\v` - Vertical tab\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nHere are some examples of using escape sequences in strings:\n\n```python\n# New line\nprint(\"Hello\\nWorld\")\n\n# Tab\nprint(\"Hello\\tWorld\")\n\n# Double quote\nprint(\"Hello \\\"World\\\"\")\n\n# Backslash\nprint(\"Hello \\\\ World\")\n```\n\n### Raw Strings\n\nRaw strings are used to treat backslashes as literal characters instead of escape characters. They are denoted by the `r` prefix before the string.\n\n```python\n# Raw string\nprint(r\"Hello \\n World\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `\\n` is treated as a literal backslash followed by an `n`, instead of a new line character.\n\n### Unicode Escape Sequences\n\nUnicode escape sequences are used to represent Unicode characters in strings. They are denoted by the `\\u` or `\\U` prefix followed by the Unicode code point.\n\n```python\n# Unicode escape sequence\nprint(\"\\u0041\")  # Prints 'A'\nprint(\"\\U00000041\")  # Prints 'A'\n```\n\nIn this example, the `\\u0041` and `\\U00000041` are used to represent the Unicode character 'A' with code point U+0041.",
