  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of natural numbers to sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Square the current number and add it to the sum\n        sum_squares += i ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    n = 5\n    result = sum_of_squares(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of the squares of the first {n} natural numbers is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sum_of_squares(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers. It uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`, squares each number, and adds it to the running sum `sum_squares`. The `main()` function demonstrates how to use this function with an example.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Initialize `sum_squares` to 0.\n2. Loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. For each number `i`, calculate its square `i ** 2`.\n4. Add the square to the running sum `sum_squares`.\n5. After the loop finishes, return the final sum `sum_squares`.\n\n**Example output:**\n\nFor `n = 5`, the output will be:\n```\nThe sum of the squares of the first 5 natural numbers is: 55\n```\nThis is because 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55.",
