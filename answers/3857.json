  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a for loop to solve the N-Queens problem, placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm with a for loop. This solution prints all possible configurations:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    def is_valid(board, row, col):\n        for i in range(row):\n            if board[i][col] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            if col - (row - i) >= 0 and board[i][col - (row - i)] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            if col + (row - i) < n and board[i][col + (row - i)] == 'Q':\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_queens(board, row):\n        if row == n:\n            result.append([''.join(row) for row in board])\n            return\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_valid(board, row, col):\n                board[row][col] = 'Q'\n                place_queens(board, row + 1)\n                board[row][col] = '.'\n\n    result = []\n    board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    place_queens(board, 0)\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    n = 4  # change this to test different board sizes\n    solutions = solve_n_queens(n)\n    for i, solution in enumerate(solutions):\n        print(f\"Solution {i + 1}:\")\n        for row in solution:\n            print(row)\n        print()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n*   The `solve_n_queens` function takes an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard and returns all possible configurations.\n*   The `is_valid` function checks whether it's safe to place a queen at a given position on the board.\n*   The `place_queens` function uses a backtracking algorithm to place queens on the board, ensuring that no two queens attack each other.\n*   In the `main` function, you can change the value of `n` to test different board sizes. The program prints all possible configurations for the given board size.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   For `n = 4`, the program will print two possible configurations, each representing a way to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard without any queen attacking another.\n*   For `n = 5`, the program will print 10 possible configurations for a 5x5 chessboard.\n*   For larger values of `n`, the number of possible configurations increases rapidly.",
