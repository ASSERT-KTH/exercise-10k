  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example implementation in Python that calculates the tax for a given income and tax rate.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax amount based on the given income and tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_amount\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 25 for 25%): \"))\n    tax_rate_decimal = tax_rate / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal\n\n    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate_decimal)\n\n    print(f\"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted.\n3. Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 25 for 25%) when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and print the tax amount.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nEnter your income: $50000\nEnter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 25 for 25%): 25\nTax amount: $12500.00\n```",
