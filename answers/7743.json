  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student grades as input, where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary containing the grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each subject across all students and return the results as a dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the average grades.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef average_grades(grades):\n    subjects = {}\n    for student in grades.values():\n        for subject, grade in student.items():\n            if subject not in subjects:\n                subjects[subject] = []\n            subjects[subject].append(grade)\n\n    averages = {}\n    for subject, grades in subjects.items():\n        averages[subject] = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n    return averages\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    'Alice': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 90, 'English': 80},\n    'Charlie': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 85, 'English': 90}\n}\n\nprint(average_grades(grades))\n```\nThis code defines the `average_grades` function, which takes a dictionary of student grades as input and returns a dictionary with the average grades for each subject. The code uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the average grades for each subject, and then returns this dictionary.\n\nThe example usage at the end shows how to call the `average_grades` function with a sample dictionary of student grades and print the resulting dictionary with the average grades for each subject.",
