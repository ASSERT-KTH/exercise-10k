  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef process_file(input_file, output_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads input from a file, converts the text to uppercase, and writes the result to another file.\n\n    Args:\n        input_file (str): The path to the input file.\n        output_file (str): The path to the output file.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to open the input file in read mode\n        with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n            # Read the contents of the file\n            text = file.read()\n        \n        # Convert the text to uppercase\n        uppercase_text = text.upper()\n\n        # Attempt to open the output file in write mode\n        with open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n            # Write the uppercase text to the output file\n            file.write(uppercase_text)\n\n        print(f\"Text successfully converted to uppercase and written to {output_file}\")\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.\")\n    except PermissionError:\n        print(f\"Error: Permission denied to read '{input_file}' or write to '{output_file}'.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input file path from the user\n    input_file = input(\"Enter the path to the input file: \")\n\n    # Get the output file path from the user\n    output_file = input(\"Enter the path to the output file: \")\n\n    # Process the file\n    process_file(input_file, output_file)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `process_file` function takes two arguments: `input_file` and `output_file`, which are the paths to the input and output files, respectively.\n2. The function attempts to open the input file in read mode (`'r'`) and reads its contents.\n3. It converts the text to uppercase using the `upper()` method.\n4. The function then attempts to open the output file in write mode (`'w'`) and writes the uppercase text to it.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the paths to the input and output files, and then calls the `process_file` function with these paths.\n6. The program includes error handling to catch potential exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`, and prints an error message if an exception occurs.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, save it to a file (e.g., `file_processor.py`) and run it from the command line:\n```bash\npython file_processor.py\n```\nWhen prompted, enter the paths to the input and output files. For example:\n```\nEnter the path to the input file: input.txt\nEnter the path to the output file: output.txt\n```\nThe program will read the input file, convert the text to uppercase, and write the result to the output file. If an error occurs, it will print an error message.",
