  "answer": "**Savings Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program takes user input for income and expenses, and calculates the total savings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_income():\n    \"\"\"Get user income\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            income = float(input(\"Enter your monthly income: $\"))\n            if income < 0:\n                print(\"Income cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                return income\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\ndef get_expenses():\n    \"\"\"Get user expenses\"\"\"\n    expenses = {}\n    while True:\n        expense_name = input(\"Enter expense name (or 'done' to finish): \")\n        if expense_name.lower() == 'done':\n            break\n        while True:\n            try:\n                expense_amount = float(input(f\"Enter {expense_name} expense amount: $\"))\n                if expense_amount < 0:\n                    print(\"Expense amount cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n                else:\n                    expenses[expense_name] = expense_amount\n                    break\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n    return expenses\n\ndef calculate_savings(income, expenses):\n    \"\"\"Calculate total savings\"\"\"\n    total_expenses = sum(expenses.values())\n    savings = income - total_expenses\n    return savings\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Savings Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n    income = get_income()\n    expenses = get_expenses()\n    savings = calculate_savings(income, expenses)\n    print(\"\\nSummary:\")\n    print(f\"Income: ${income:.2f}\")\n    print(\"Expenses:\")\n    for expense, amount in expenses.items():\n        print(f\"  {expense}: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Expenses: ${sum(expenses.values()):.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Savings: ${savings:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your monthly income when prompted.\n3. Enter your expenses one by one, specifying the name and amount of each expense.\n4. Type 'done' to finish entering expenses.\n5. The program will display a summary of your income, expenses, and savings.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a dictionary to store expenses, where each key is the expense name and the value is the expense amount.\n* The program calculates the total savings by subtracting the total expenses from the income.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters valid input for income and expenses.\n* The program uses an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the program is run directly.",
