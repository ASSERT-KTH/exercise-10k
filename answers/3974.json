  "prompt": "Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The program should take a list of integers as input and output the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the insertion sort algorithm based on the provided specifications:\n```\ndef insertionSort(A):\n    for i in range(1, len(A)):\n        key = A[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < A[j]:\n            A[j + 1] = A[j]\n            j -= 1\n        A[j + 1] = key\n    return A\n\n# Example usage\nA = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]\nsorted_A = insertionSort(A)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_A)\n\n# Expected output\n# Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\nThis code follows the step-by-step explanation provided earlier and implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The `insertionSort` function takes a list `A` as input, sorts it in-place using the insertion sort algorithm, and returns the sorted list. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `insertionSort` function to sort a list of integers.",
