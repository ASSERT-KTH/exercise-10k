  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism given its length, width, and height.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism\ndef calculate_volume(length, width, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism.\n\n    Parameters:\n    length (float): The length of the rectangular prism.\n    width (float): The width of the rectangular prism.\n    height (float): The height of the rectangular prism.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The volume of the rectangular prism.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = length * width * height\n    return volume\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the dimensions of the rectangular prism from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the rectangular prism: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the volume\n    volume = calculate_volume(length, width, height)\n    print(f\"The volume of the rectangular prism is: {volume} cubic units\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `rectangular_prism_volume.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python rectangular_prism_volume.py` and press Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism.\n5. The program will calculate and display the volume of the rectangular prism.\n\n### Explanation\n* The `calculate_volume` function takes in the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism as parameters and returns the calculated volume.\n* The `main` function gets the dimensions of the rectangular prism from the user, calls the `calculate_volume` function, and displays the result.\n* The program uses the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is `length * width * height`.",
