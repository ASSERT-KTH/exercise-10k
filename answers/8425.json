  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes an integer year as input and checks if it is a leap year using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is perfectly divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.\n    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year.\n2. The function uses the following rules to determine if a year is a leap year:\n\t* The year must be divisible by 4.\n\t* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.\n3. The `main` function gets the year from the user, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `2020`\nOutput: `2020 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `2019`\nOutput: `2019 is not a leap year.`\n* Input: `2000`\nOutput: `2000 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `1900`\nOutput: `1900 is not a leap year.`",
