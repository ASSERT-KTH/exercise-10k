The function `check_password_strength` takes a password as input and checks its strength based on the specified criteria.\n2. The password strength is determined by the number of criteria met, with 5 criteria indicating a strong password, 3-4 criteria indicating a medium password, and fewer than 3 criteria indicating a weak password.\n3. The function returns a dictionary containing the password strength and a list of suggestions for improvement.\n4. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function and display the results.",
