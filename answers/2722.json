  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0\n```\n\nYou can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to calculate the average of different lists of numbers.",
