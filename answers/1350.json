  "answer": "**Tuple Operations Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program demonstrates basic tuple operations such as indexing, slicing, concatenation, and repetition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef tuple_operations():\n    # Initialize a tuple\n    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n    # Indexing\n    print(\"Indexing:\")\n    print(\"Element at index 0:\", my_tuple[0])\n    print(\"Element at index -1:\", my_tuple[-1])\n\n    # Slicing\n    print(\"\\nSlicing:\")\n    print(\"Elements from index 1 to 3:\", my_tuple[1:4])\n    print(\"Elements from index 2 to the end:\", my_tuple[2:])\n    print(\"Elements from the start to index 3:\", my_tuple[:4])\n    print(\"All elements:\", my_tuple[:])\n\n    # Concatenation\n    print(\"\\nConcatenation:\")\n    tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\n    tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)\n    concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2\n    print(\"Concatenated tuple:\", concatenated_tuple)\n\n    # Repetition\n    print(\"\\nRepetition:\")\n    repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 2\n    print(\"Repeated tuple:\", repeated_tuple)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tuple_operations()\n```\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nIndexing:\nElement at index 0: 1\nElement at index -1: 5\n\nSlicing:\nElements from index 1 to 3: (2, 3, 4)\nElements from index 2 to the end: (3, 4, 5)\nElements from the start to index 3: (1, 2, 3, 4)\nAll elements: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nConcatenation:\nConcatenated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\nRepetition:\nRepeated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Indexing**: Accessing elements in a tuple using their index.\n2. **Slicing**: Extracting a subset of elements from a tuple using a range of indices.\n3. **Concatenation**: Combining two or more tuples into a single tuple using the `+` operator.\n4. **Repetition**: Creating a new tuple by repeating the elements of an existing tuple using the `*` operator.\n\nNote: Tuples are immutable in Python, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation. The `+` and `*` operators create new tuples, they do not modify the original tuples.",
