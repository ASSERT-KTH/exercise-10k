  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is positive, print 'Positive'. If the number is negative, print 'Negative'. If the number is zero, print 'Zero'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs the task:\n\n```python\ndef check_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.\n\n    Args:\n    num (int or float): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    if num > 0:\n        print('Positive')\n    elif num < 0:\n        print('Negative')\n    else:\n        print('Zero')\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    check_number(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We define a function called `check_number` that takes one argument, `num`.\n*   Inside the function, we use an `if-elif-else` statement to check the value of `num`.\n*   If `num` is greater than 0, we print 'Positive'.\n*   If `num` is less than 0, we print 'Negative'.\n*   If `num` is neither greater than nor less than 0 (i.e., it's equal to 0), we print 'Zero'.\n*   In the example usage, we ask the user for a number, convert it to a float, and then call the `check_number` function with the user's input.\n\n### Advice:\n\n*   This program assumes that the input will be a valid number. You may want to add error checking code to handle cases where the input is not a number.\n*   You can modify the program to handle other types of input, such as complex numbers or strings that represent numbers.",
