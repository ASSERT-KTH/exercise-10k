  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.balance = 0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}.

Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4.

The `main` function provides a simple menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program. The user can deposit money, withdraw money, check the current balance, or exit the program. The program also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and non-negative amounts.",
