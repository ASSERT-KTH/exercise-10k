  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle based on the distance traveled and fuel consumed. The user is prompted to enter the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed, and the program then calculates and displays the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L).\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed, unit='miles'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the fuel efficiency based on the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled.\n        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed.\n        unit (str, optional): The unit of measurement for distance. Defaults to 'miles'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L).\n    \"\"\"\n    if unit == 'miles':\n        fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumed\n        return fuel_efficiency\n    elif unit == 'kilometers':\n        fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumed\n        return fuel_efficiency\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid unit. Please use 'miles' or 'kilometers'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Fuel Efficiency Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    distance_unit = input(\"Enter the unit of measurement for distance (miles/kilometers): \")\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled: \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed (gallons/liters): \"))\n\n    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed, unit=distance_unit)\n\n    if distance_unit == 'miles':\n        print(f\"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon (mpg)\")\n    elif distance_unit == 'kilometers':\n        print(f\"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} kilometers per liter (km/L)\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Calculate fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg):\n    * Enter the unit of measurement for distance: miles\n    * Enter the distance traveled: 250\n    * Enter the amount of fuel consumed: 10\n    * Output: Fuel efficiency: 25.00 miles per gallon (mpg)\n2. Calculate fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter (km/L):\n    * Enter the unit of measurement for distance: kilometers\n    * Enter the distance traveled: 400\n    * Enter the amount of fuel consumed: 20\n    * Output: Fuel efficiency: 20.00 kilometers per liter (km/L)\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the user will enter valid input for distance and fuel consumption.\n* The program uses a simple formula to calculate fuel efficiency: distance traveled / fuel consumed.\n* The program supports two units of measurement for distance: miles and kilometers.\n* The program uses the `float` data type to store and calculate fuel efficiency, which allows for decimal points in the output.",
