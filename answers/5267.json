  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game rules are as follows:\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get player 1's choice\n        player1_choice = input(\"Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while player1_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            player1_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        # Get player 2's choice\n        player2_choice = input(\"Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while player2_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            player2_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        # Determine the winner\n        if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n            print(\"It's a tie!\")\n        elif (player1_choice == \"rock\" and player2_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n             (player1_choice == \"scissors\" and player2_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n             (player1_choice == \"paper\" and player2_choice == \"rock\"):\n            print(\"Player 1 wins!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Player 2 wins!\")\n\n        # Ask if players want to play again\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `play_game` function contains the game logic.\n2. The game runs in a loop until the players decide to stop playing.\n3. In each iteration, the program asks both players for their choices and validates the input to ensure it is one of the allowed options (rock, paper, or scissors).\n4. The program then determines the winner based on the game rules using conditional statements.\n5. Finally, the program asks the players if they want to play again and breaks the loop if they respond with anything other than \"yes\".\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
