  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef exponentiation(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the exponentiation result of two given numbers.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    base (float): The base number.\n    exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Check if the inputs are numbers\n        if not isinstance(base, (int, float)) or not isinstance(exponent, (int, float)):\n            raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be numbers.\")\n        \n        # Calculate the exponentiation result\n        result = base ** exponent\n        \n        return result\n    \n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and exponent from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n    \n    # Calculate and print the exponentiation result\n    result = exponentiation(base, exponent)\n    \n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `exponentiation` function takes two parameters, `base` and `exponent`, and returns their exponentiation result.\n*   It first checks if both inputs are numbers. If not, it raises a TypeError.\n*   The `**` operator is used to calculate the exponentiation result.\n*   In the `main` function, the program asks the user to input the base and exponent, calculates the exponentiation result using the `exponentiation` function, and prints the result.",
