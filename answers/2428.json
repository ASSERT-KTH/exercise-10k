  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop and conditional statements to find all prime numbers up to a given number `n`.\n\n```python\ndef find_primes(n):\n    primes = []\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        is_prime = True\n        for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if i % j == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(i)\n    return primes\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(find_primes(n))\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The program starts by asking the user to enter a number `n`.\n2. It then calls the `find_primes` function with `n` as an argument.\n3. Inside the `find_primes` function, it initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n4. It then uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive).\n5. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a prime number by using another for loop to iterate over all numbers from 2 to the square root of `i`.\n6. If `i` is divisible by any of these numbers, it sets `is_prime` to `False` and breaks out of the inner loop.\n7. If `is_prime` is still `True` after the inner loop, it adds `i` to the `primes` list.\n8. Finally, it returns the `primes` list and prints it out.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf you enter `20` when prompted, the program will output:\n\n```\n[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]\n```\n\nThis is because these are all the prime numbers less than or equal to `20`.",
