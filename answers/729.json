  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and outputs the compound interest.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates compound interest:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal)\n        time (int): The time the money is invested for (in years)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** time - principal\n    return compound_interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time (in years): \"))\n\n    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: {compound_interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes in the principal amount, interest rate, and time as arguments.\n2. It calculates the compound interest using the formula: `A = P (1 + r)^t`, where `A` is the amount after `t` years, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time.\n3. The compound interest is then calculated by subtracting the principal amount from the total amount.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n5. The `calculate_compound_interest` function is then called with these values, and the result is printed out.\n\n### Example use cases\n* If you invest $1000 at an interest rate of 5% for 5 years, the compound interest would be $276.28.\n* If you invest $5000 at an interest rate of 10% for 10 years, the compound interest would be $1296.84.",
