  "answer": "**Console Output Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that writes output to the console:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Print a simple message to the console\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n    # Ask the user for their name\n    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\n    # Print a personalized greeting to the console\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Save this code to a file named `console_output.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.\n3. Run the program using the command `python console_output.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to see the output in the console.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `print` function is used to write output to the console.\n2. The `input` function is used to get user input from the console.\n3. The `main` function contains the program's entry point and is called when the script is run.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.",
