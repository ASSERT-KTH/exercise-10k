  "answer": "**Scrambled Word Generator**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user for a word and then prints out a scrambled version of the word.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scrambles the input word\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(\"Scrambled word: \", scrambled_word)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it into a list of characters.\n2. It uses the `random.shuffle` function to randomly rearrange the characters in the list.\n3. The scrambled characters are then joined back together into a string using the `join` method.\n4. The `main` function asks the user for a word, scrambles it, and prints out the scrambled word.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n```\nPlease enter a word: hello\nScrambled word:  olleh\n```\n\nNote: The scrambled word will be different each time you run the program, as the `random.shuffle` function generates a random permutation of the characters.",
