  "answer": "**Discounted Price Calculator Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program takes the total cost and the discount percentage as input and calculates the discounted price using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_discounted_price(total_cost, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discounted price based on the total cost and discount percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        total_cost (float): The total cost of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discounted price.\n    \"\"\"\n    if discount_percentage < 0 or discount_percentage > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid discount percentage. Please enter a value between 0 and 100.\")\n        return None\n    elif total_cost < 0:\n        print(\"Invalid total cost. Please enter a non-negative value.\")\n        return None\n    else:\n        discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * total_cost\n        discounted_price = total_cost - discount_amount\n        return discounted_price\n\ndef main():\n    total_cost = float(input(\"Enter the total cost: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(total_cost, discount_percentage)\n\n    if discounted_price is not None:\n        print(f\"Discounted price: {discounted_price:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter the total cost: 100\n    Enter the discount percentage: 10\n    Discounted price: 90.00\n*   Enter the total cost: 50\n    Enter the discount percentage: 20\n    Discounted price: 40.00\n*   Enter the total cost: 200\n    Enter the discount percentage: 5\n    Discounted price: 190.00\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The program defines a function `calculate_discounted_price` that takes the total cost and discount percentage as input.\n2.  It checks if the discount percentage is within the valid range (0-100) and if the total cost is non-negative.\n3.  If the inputs are valid, it calculates the discount amount by multiplying the total cost with the discount percentage divided by 100.\n4.  The discounted price is then calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the total cost.\n5.  The `main` function prompts the user to enter the total cost and discount percentage, calls the `calculate_discounted_price` function, and prints the discounted price if the inputs are valid.",
