  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 hollow square pattern of asterisks (*).",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints a 5x5 hollow square pattern of asterisks using nested for loops:\n\n```python\ndef print_hollow_square(size):\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Print asterisk if it's on the border\n            if i == 0 or i == size - 1 or j == 0 or j == size - 1:\n                print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                print(\" \", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Print a 5x5 hollow square\nprint_hollow_square(5)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_hollow_square` function takes an integer `size` as input and prints a hollow square of asterisks with the specified size. The outer loop (`for i in range(size)`) iterates over each row of the square, and the inner loop (`for j in range(size)`) iterates over each column. If the current position is on the border of the square (i.e., `i == 0`, `i == size - 1`, `j == 0`, or `j == size - 1`), an asterisk is printed; otherwise, a space is printed.\n\nYou can adjust the size of the square by passing a different value to the `print_hollow_square` function. For example, `print_hollow_square(3)` would print a 3x3 hollow square.",
