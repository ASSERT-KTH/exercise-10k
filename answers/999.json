  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the percentage of a number based on the user's input. The program uses if-else statements to check for valid input.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_percentage():\n    # Get the number and percentage from the user\n    num = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n    percent = input(\"Enter a percentage: \")\n\n    # Check if the inputs are valid numbers\n    if num.replace('.', '', 1).replace('-', '', 1).isdigit() and percent.replace('.', '', 1).replace('-', '', 1).isdigit():\n        num = float(num)\n        percent = float(percent)\n\n        # Check if the percentage is within valid range (0-100)\n        if 0 <= percent <= 100:\n            # Calculate the percentage of the number\n            result = (percent / 100) * num\n            print(f\"{percent}% of {num} is {result}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid percentage. Please enter a percentage between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number and percentage.\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_percentage()\n```\n\nThis program does the following:\n\n1. Asks the user to enter a number and a percentage.\n2. Checks if the inputs are valid numbers using the `isdigit()` method. It also allows for decimal points and negative signs.\n3. If the inputs are valid, converts them to floats.\n4. Checks if the percentage is within the valid range of 0-100.\n5. If the percentage is valid, calculates the percentage of the number by multiplying the number by the percentage divided by 100.\n6. Prints the result to the console.\n7. If any of the inputs are invalid, prints an error message to the console.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a number and a percentage when prompted, and it will calculate and print the percentage of the number.",
