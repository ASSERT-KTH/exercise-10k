  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the energy consumption of a device based on its usage. The program should use if/else statements to determine the energy consumption category.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_energy_consumption(device_name, usage_hours, power_consumption):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the energy consumption of a device.\n\n    Args:\n    - device_name (str): The name of the device.\n    - usage_hours (float): The number of hours the device is used per day.\n    - power_consumption (float): The power consumption of the device in watts.\n\n    Returns:\n    - energy_consumption (float): The daily energy consumption of the device in watt-hours.\n    - category (str): The energy consumption category of the device.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the energy consumption in watt-hours\n    energy_consumption = usage_hours * power_consumption\n\n    # Determine the energy consumption category\n    if energy_consumption <= 10:\n        category = \"Low\"\n    elif energy_consumption <= 50:\n        category = \"Moderate\"\n    elif energy_consumption <= 100:\n        category = \"High\"\n    else:\n        category = \"Very High\"\n\n    return energy_consumption, category\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    device_name = \"Laptop\"\n    usage_hours = 8\n    power_consumption = 65  # watts\n\n    energy_consumption, category = calculate_energy_consumption(\n        device_name, usage_hours, power_consumption\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Device: {device_name}\")\n    print(f\"Daily Energy Consumption: {energy_consumption} Wh\")\n    print(f\"Energy Consumption Category: {category}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_energy_consumption` function takes the device name, usage hours, and power consumption as arguments.\n2. **Energy Consumption Calculation**: It calculates the energy consumption by multiplying the usage hours by the power consumption.\n3. **Category Determination**: The function uses if/else statements to determine the energy consumption category based on the calculated energy consumption.\n4. **Example Usage**: In the `main` function, an example device (laptop) is used to demonstrate the calculation of energy consumption and its category.\n5. **Output**: The program prints the device name, daily energy consumption, and the corresponding energy consumption category.\n\n### Energy Consumption Categories:\n- **Low**: \u2264 10 Wh\n- **Moderate**: > 10 Wh and \u2264 50 Wh\n- **High**: > 50 Wh and \u2264 100 Wh\n- **Very High**: > 100 Wh\n\nFeel free to modify the categories and their corresponding watt-hour ranges according to your specific needs.",
