  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(sequence) < n:\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num_terms = 10\n    sequence = generate_fibonacci(num_terms)\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the sequence.\n2. It first checks for base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the sequence with the first two numbers (0 and 1) and then enters a loop to generate the remaining numbers.\n4. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the sequence.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `generate_fibonacci` function to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
