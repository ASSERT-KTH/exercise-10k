  "answer": "**Character Count Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string and a character as input and returns the count of the specified character in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_character(input_string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the count of a specific character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to search in.\n        char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The count of the specified character.\n    \"\"\"\n    return input_string.count(char)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character to count: \")\n    count = count_character(input_string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count} times in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a string when prompted (e.g., \"Hello World\").\n3. Enter a character to count when prompted (e.g., \"l\").\n4. The program will output the count of the specified character (e.g., \"The character 'l' appears 3 times in the string.\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings to count the occurrences of the specified character.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output, while the `count_character` function performs the actual counting.\n* The program assumes that the input string and character are both single characters. If you need to count occurrences of a longer string, you can modify the program accordingly.",
