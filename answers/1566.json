  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two input functions, explaining the process and providing a clear example implementation. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as input and returns their composition.\n    \n    Args:\n        f (function): The outer function in the composition.\n        g (function): The inner function in the composition.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We will use a lambda function to create the composition of f and g.\n    # The lambda function takes an argument x and applies g to it first, then applies f to the result.\n    # This is the definition of function composition in mathematics.\n    return lambda x: f(g(x))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    # A function that doubles its input.\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    # A function that adds one to its input.\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions to create a new function that doubles and then adds one.\ndouble_then_add_one = compose_functions(add_one, double)\n\n# Test the composed function.\nprint(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions `f` and `g` as input and returns a new function that represents their composition. This is achieved using a `lambda` function, which applies `g` to the input first, then applies `f` to the result.\n* In the example usage, two simple functions `double` and `add_one` are defined. The `compose_functions` function is then used to create a new function `double_then_add_one` that doubles the input and then adds one.\n* The `double_then_add_one` function is tested with the input `5`, demonstrating the composition of the two input functions.\n* The use of `lambda` functions allows for concise and expressive code, making it easy to create and compose functions in a functional programming style.",
