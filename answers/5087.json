  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's name and age as input and prints out a personalized message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_personalized_message():\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\nprint_personalized_message()\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a function called `print_personalized_message`. Inside this function, we use the built-in `input` function to get the user's name and age. We convert the age to an integer using `int()` because `input` returns a string by default. Then, we print out a personalized message using f-strings, which allow us to embed expressions inside string literals.\n\nHere's an example of how the program would work:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 25\nHello, John! You are 25 years old.\n```\n\nNote: This program does not include any error checking. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to make sure the user enters a valid name and age. For example, you might want to check that the age is a positive integer.",
