  "answer": "### Dictionary Union Calculation\n#### Problem Statement\nCreate two dictionaries with names of countries as keys and their capitals as values. Calculate the union of the two dictionaries and print the resulting dictionary.\n\n#### Solution\n\n```python\ndef dict_union(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the union of two dictionaries.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n\n# Define the dictionaries\ncountries_dict1 = {\n    \"France\": \"Paris\",\n    \"Germany\": \"Berlin\",\n    \"Italy\": \"Rome\"\n}\n\ncountries_dict2 = {\n    \"Spain\": \"Madrid\",\n    \"Portugal\": \"Lisbon\",\n    \"Germany\": \"Munich\"  # Note: This will override the value in dict1\n}\n\n# Calculate the union of the dictionaries\nresult_dict = dict_union(countries_dict1, countries_dict2)\n\n# Print the resulting dictionary\nprint(\"Dictionary Union:\")\nfor country, capital in result_dict.items():\n    print(f\"{country}: {capital}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `dict_union` that takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n*   We use the dictionary unpacking operator (`**`) to merge the two input dictionaries into a new dictionary.\n*   If a key exists in both input dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary (`dict2`) will override the value from the first dictionary (`dict1`).\n*   We create two example dictionaries, `countries_dict1` and `countries_dict2`, with country names as keys and their capitals as values.\n*   We calculate the union of the two dictionaries using the `dict_union` function and store the result in `result_dict`.\n*   Finally, we print the resulting dictionary, iterating over its key-value pairs and displaying each country and its capital.\n\n#### Example Output\n\n```\nDictionary Union:\nFrance: Paris\nGermany: Munich\nItaly: Rome\nSpain: Madrid\nPortugal: Lisbon\n```\n\nIn this example, the value for \"Germany\" in the resulting dictionary is \"Munich\" because it overrides the value \"Berlin\" from the first dictionary.",
