  "answer": "**Number Sequence Printer Program**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that asks the user for a number and prints out a sequence of numbers from 1 to that number:\n\n```python\ndef print_number_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a number and prints out a sequence of numbers from 1 to that number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for a number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if num <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Print the number sequence\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        print(i)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_number_sequence()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a positive integer when prompted (e.g., 5).\n3. The program will print out the number sequence from 1 to the entered number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a positive integer.\n* The `try`-`except` block is used to catch `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the user enters a non-integer value.\n* The `range` function is used to generate the number sequence.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `print_number_sequence` function is called when the script is run directly.",
