  "prompt": "Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user can choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the program generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"Rock\" and computer_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Paper\" and computer_choice == \"Rock\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Scissors\" and computer_choice == \"Paper\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()\n        if user_choice not in [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Get Computer Choice**: The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.\n2. **Determine Winner**: The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. **Main Loop**: The `main` function runs a loop where the user is prompted to enter their choice. The program checks if the user wants to quit and validates their input.\n4. **Display Choices and Result**: The program displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program and follow the prompts:\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: Rock\n\nYou chose: Rock\nComputer chose: Scissors\n\nYou win!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: \n```",
