  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to N using a While Loop**\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that prints numbers from 1 to N using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints numbers from 1 to n using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        print(i)\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nn = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nprint_numbers(n)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The `print_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. The variable `i` is initialized to 1.\n3. The while loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n4. Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is printed.\n5. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 using `i += 1`.\n6. Once the loop finishes, the function returns, and the program terminates.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nIf you enter `5` when prompted, the program will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If you want to handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, you will need to add error checking code.\n* This program uses a simple while loop to print the numbers. For larger values of `n`, a more efficient approach might be to use a for loop or a list comprehension.",
