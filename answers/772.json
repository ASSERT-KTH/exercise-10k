  "answer": "Here's a Python program that demonstrates the concept of floating point precision by performing arithmetic operations on floating point numbers:\n\n```python\ndef floating_point_precision():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the concept of floating point precision by performing arithmetic operations on floating point numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define two floating point numbers\n    num1 = 0.1\n    num2 = 0.2\n\n    # Perform addition\n    sum_result = num1 + num2\n    print(f\"Sum of {num1} and {num2}: {sum_result}\")\n\n    # Perform subtraction\n    diff_result = num1 - num2\n    print(f\"Difference of {num1} and {num2}: {diff_result}\")\n\n    # Perform multiplication\n    product_result = num1 * num2\n    print(f\"Product of {num1} and {num2}: {product_result}\")\n\n    # Perform division\n    quotient_result = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"Quotient of {num1} and {num2}: {quotient_result}\")\n\n    # Check for equality\n    if num1 + num2 == 0.3:\n        print(\"Equality check: 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Equality check: 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3\")\n\n    # Check for rounding errors\n    print(\"Rounding errors:\")\n    print(f\"0.1 + 0.2 = {num1 + num2}\")\n    print(f\"0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: {num1 + num2 == 0.3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    floating_point_precision()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The program defines two floating point numbers `num1` and `num2`.\n2. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers.\n3. It checks for equality between the sum of `num1` and `num2` and 0.3.\n4. It demonstrates rounding errors by printing the result of the addition and checking if it equals 0.3.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nSum of 0.1 and 0.2: 0.30000000000000004\nDifference of 0.1 and 0.2: -0.1\nProduct of 0.1 and 0.2: 0.02\nQuotient of 0.1 and 0.2: 0.5\nEquality check: 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3\nRounding errors:\n0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004\n0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: False\n```\n\n**Note:** The results may vary depending on the system's floating point precision.",
