  "answer": "**CSV Reader Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that reads a CSV file and prints out its contents.\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef read_csv_file(file_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a CSV file and prints out its contents.\n\n    Args:\n        file_name (str): The name of the CSV file to read.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n            csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n            for row in csv_reader:\n                print(row)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{file_name}' not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef main():\n    file_name = input(\"Enter the CSV file name: \")\n    read_csv_file(file_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n1. Save this code in a file, for example, `csv_reader.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python, for example, `python csv_reader.py`.\n3. When prompted, enter the name of the CSV file you want to read.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program assumes that the CSV file is in the same directory as the Python script. If the CSV file is in a different directory, you need to provide the full path to the file.\n* This program prints out each row of the CSV file as a list of values.\n* This program does not handle any specific CSV formatting or errors beyond what the `csv` module provides. If you need more advanced CSV handling, you may want to consider using a library like `pandas`.",
