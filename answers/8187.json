  "answer": "Here's a Python program that plays Rock Paper Scissors using a while loop:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's choice by selecting a random option.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's choice by asking for input.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Play Rock Paper Scissors using a while loop.\"\"\"\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = get_user_choice()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'y' or 'n': \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the following functions:\n\n1.  `get_computer_choice()`: Returns the computer's choice by selecting a random option from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n2.  `get_user_choice()`: Asks the user for their choice and validates the input to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n3.  `determine_winner()`: Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices by comparing them according to the Rock Paper Scissors rules.\n4.  `main()`: Plays Rock Paper Scissors using a while loop, asking the user for their choice, generating the computer's choice, determining the winner, and asking if the user wants to play again.\n\nYou can run this program to play Rock Paper Scissors. It will continue to ask you for your choice and play again until you choose to stop.",
