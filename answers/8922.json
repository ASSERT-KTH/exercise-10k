  "answer": "**Power of Two Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is a power of two. A power of two is a number that can be expressed as 2^n, where n is an integer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a power of two.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is a power of two, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"Is {num} a power of two? {is_power_of_two(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `is_power_of_two` function uses bitwise operations to check if a number is a power of two. The expression `n & (n - 1)` performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`. If `n` is a power of two, its binary representation has exactly one bit set to 1 (the bit in the place that corresponds to the power of two). Subtracting 1 from `n` will result in a number that has all the bits to the right of the first 1 set to 1 and all the bits to the left of the first 1 set to 0. Therefore, the bitwise AND operation will result in 0.\n\nIn the `main` function, we test the `is_power_of_two` function with a list of numbers and print the results.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nIs 1 a power of two? True\nIs 2 a power of two? True\nIs 4 a power of two? True\nIs 8 a power of two? True\nIs 16 a power of two? True\nIs 20 a power of two? False\nIs 32 a power of two? True\nIs 64 a power of two? True\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(1), as it only performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.",
