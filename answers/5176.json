  "prompt": "Write a function to convert a list of tuples to a dictionary, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that converts a list of tuples into a dictionary. This function will take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a key-value pair, and return a dictionary representation of the input list. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_dict(tuple_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.\n    It returns a dictionary where the first element of each tuple is a key and the second element is its corresponding value.\n\n    Args:\n        tuple_list (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the first element of each tuple is a key and the second element is its corresponding value.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs\n    result_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        # Check if the tuple has exactly two elements (key and value)\n        if len(tup) == 2:\n            # Extract the key and value from the tuple\n            key, value = tup\n            \n            # Add the key-value pair to the dictionary\n            result_dict[key] = value\n        else:\n            # If the tuple does not have exactly two elements, raise a ValueError\n            raise ValueError(\"Each tuple must have exactly two elements (key and value)\")\n\n    # Return the resulting dictionary\n    return result_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ntuple_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\nprint(convert_to_dict(tuple_list))  # Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `convert_to_dict` initializes an empty dictionary `result_dict` to store the key-value pairs from the input list of tuples.\n*   It iterates over each tuple in the input list, checks if the tuple has exactly two elements (key and value), and adds the key-value pair to the dictionary.\n*   If a tuple does not have exactly two elements, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.\n*   Finally, the function returns the resulting dictionary `result_dict`.",
