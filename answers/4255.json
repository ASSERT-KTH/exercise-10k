The `Course` class represents a university course, and the `Student` class represents a student who can register for courses.\n\nThe `Student` class has methods to register for a course and print registration details. The `register_course` method takes a `Course` object as input and adds it to the student's list of courses. The `print_registration_details` method prints the registration details for the student, including the course ID, course name, and semester for each registered course.\n\nIn the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter their student ID and name, and then creates a `Student` object. The program then enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user to choose an option:\n\n*   Register for a course: Prompts the user to enter the course ID, course name, and semester, and then registers the student for the course.\n*   Print registration details: Prints the registration details for the student.\n*   Exit: Exits the program.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n1.  Run the program and enter your student ID and name when prompted.\n2.  Choose option 1 to register for a course. Enter the course ID, course name, and semester when prompted.\n3.  Choose option 2 to print your registration details. The program will display the course ID, course name, and semester for each registered course.\n4.  Choose option 3 to exit the program.",
