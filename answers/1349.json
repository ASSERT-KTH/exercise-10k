  "answer": "**Set Operations Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program performs basic set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference) on two given sets.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef set_operations(set1, set2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform basic set operations on two given sets.\n\n    Args:\n        set1 (set): The first set.\n        set2 (set): The second set.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the results of the set operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    operations = {\n        \"union\": set1.union(set2),\n        \"intersection\": set1.intersection(set2),\n        \"difference\": set1.difference(set2),\n        \"symmetric_difference\": set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    }\n    return operations\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n    operations = set_operations(set1, set2)\n\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Union:\", operations[\"union\"])\n    print(\"Intersection:\", operations[\"intersection\"])\n    print(\"Difference (Set 1 - Set 2):\", operations[\"difference\"])\n    print(\"Symmetric Difference:\", operations[\"symmetric_difference\"])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `set_operations` function takes two sets as input and returns a dictionary containing the results of the set operations.\n2. The `union` method returns a set containing all elements that are in either set1 or set2.\n3. The `intersection` method returns a set containing all elements that are in both set1 and set2.\n4. The `difference` method returns a set containing all elements that are in set1 but not in set2.\n5. The `symmetric_difference` method returns a set containing all elements that are in either set1 or set2, but not in both.\n6. In the `main` function, we create two example sets and call the `set_operations` function to perform the set operations.\n\n### Output\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nIntersection: {4, 5}\nDifference (Set 1 - Set 2): {1, 2, 3}\nSymmetric Difference: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n```\nNote that the order of the elements in the sets may vary, as sets are unordered data structures in Python.",
