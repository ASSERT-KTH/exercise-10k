  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and address. Store the input information in variables and then print it out in a formatted manner. For example, 'Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Address: 123 Main St.'",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Gets user information from input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    address = input(\"Please enter your address: \")\n    return name, age, address\n\ndef print_user_info(name, age, address):\n    \"\"\"Prints user information in a formatted manner.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Address: {address}\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    name, age, address = get_user_info()\n    print_user_info(name, age, address)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **User Input**: The `get_user_info` function prompts the user for their name, age, and address using the built-in `input` function.\n2. **Data Storage**: The input information is stored in the `name`, `age`, and `address` variables.\n3. **Data Printing**: The `print_user_info` function takes the stored information and prints it out in a formatted manner using an f-string.\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_user_info` to print it out.\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter your name, age, and address. After entering the information, it will print it out in the desired format.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John Doe\nPlease enter your age: 25\nPlease enter your address: 123 Main St\nName: John Doe, Age: 25, Address: 123 Main St\n```",
