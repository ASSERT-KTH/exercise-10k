  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using a for loop. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n3. We use a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n4. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, `n` is not prime, so we return `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so we return `True`.\n6. In the `main` function, we ask the user to input a number and check if it's prime using the `is_prime` function. We then print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 25\nOutput: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Input: 23\nOutput: 23 is a prime number.\n* Input: 37\nOutput: 37 is a prime number.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized numbers. For larger numbers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
