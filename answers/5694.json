  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an object as input and checks if it's empty or not using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n// Type definitions for the object\nlet obj: {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n  is_admin: boolean;\n};\n\n// Initialization of the object\nobj = {\n  name: \"John Doe\",\n  id: 123,\n  is_admin: true\n};\n\n// Conditional statement to check for emptiness\nif (obj) {\n  console.log(\"Object is not empty\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Object is empty\");\n}\n```\nNote that I've assumed that the object `obj` is defined in the same scope as the code snippet, and that the properties `name`, `id`, and `is_admin` are defined as specified. I've also used the `console.log` function to print the result of the conditional statement, as specified. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the code!",
