  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\n# Program Description:\n# This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)\n# based on the user's choice. It handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors.\n\n# Input Section\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Operator Input Section\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n# Calculation Section\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        exit()\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid operator.\")\n    exit()\n\n# Output Section\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\nNote: I've left the `Author` and `Date` fields blank, as they are not specified in the problem statement. You can fill them in accordingly. Also, I've used `utf-8` encoding for the program, which is a common encoding standard.",
