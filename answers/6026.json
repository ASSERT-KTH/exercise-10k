  "prompt": "Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Use the function to calculate the factorial of 5.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function:\n```\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nresult = factorial(5)\nprint(\"Factorial of 5 is: \", result)\n```\nThis code defines the `factorial` function as described in the specification. The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial using recursion. The `if` statement checks if `n` is 0, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. The result of the recursive call is then returned.\n\nThe code then calls the `factorial` function with the argument `5` and prints the result to the console.",
