  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a list of names and a list of ages as input and returns a dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python solution for this problem. This program uses the built-in `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from the two lists and then uses a dictionary comprehension to create the desired dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef create_name_age_dict(names, ages):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input, one for names and one for ages.\n    It returns a dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age.\n    \n    Args:\n        names (list): A list of names\n        ages (list): A list of ages\n        \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each name is mapped to its corresponding age\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the lengths of the two lists are equal\n    if len(names) != len(ages):\n        raise ValueError(\"The lists of names and ages must be of the same length\")\n    \n    # Use zip to pair corresponding elements from the two lists\n    # and a dictionary comprehension to create the desired dictionary\n    name_age_dict = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}\n    \n    return name_age_dict\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnames = [\"John\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\nages = [25, 30, 35]\n\nname_age_dict = create_name_age_dict(names, ages)\nprint(name_age_dict)\n```\n\nThis program will output:\n```python\n{'John': 25, 'Alice': 30, 'Bob': 35}\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input lists are of the same length. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError`. If you want to handle lists of different lengths differently, you can modify the program accordingly. For example, you could use `zip_longest` from the `itertools` module to pair elements from the two lists, filling in a default value for the shorter list when it runs out of elements.",
