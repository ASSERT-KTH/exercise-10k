  "prompt": "Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:\n\n```python\n# This is a comment, anything after the \"#\" symbol is ignored by the compiler\n\ndef main():\n    # Print \"Hello, World!\" to the console\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Call the main function when the script is run\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `hello.py`), then run it with Python (for example, `python hello.py` in the terminal). The program will print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n**Alternative Solution**\n\nIf you just want a one-liner, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous example, but it's more concise.",
