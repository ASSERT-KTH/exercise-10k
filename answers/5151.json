  "answer": "### Counting Students by Age\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a dictionary comprehension in Python. Here's a simple function that takes a dictionary of students and their ages, and returns a dictionary with the count of students for each age.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_students_by_age(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of students for each age in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are ages and values are the number of students for each age.\n    \"\"\"\n    age_count = {}\n    for age in students.values():\n        if age in age_count:\n            age_count[age] += 1\n        else:\n            age_count[age] = 1\n    return age_count\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 21,\n    \"Bob\": 20,\n    \"Charlie\": 22,\n    \"David\": 21\n}\n\nage_count = count_students_by_age(students)\nprint(age_count)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function `count_students_by_age` takes a dictionary `students` as input.\n*   It initializes an empty dictionary `age_count` to store the count of students for each age.\n*   It iterates over the values (ages) in the `students` dictionary.\n*   For each age, it checks if the age is already in the `age_count` dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by 1. If not, it adds the age to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n*   Finally, it returns the `age_count` dictionary.\n\n#### Output\n\nWhen you run this code with the example `students` dictionary, it will output:\n\n```python\n{20: 2, 21: 2, 22: 1}\n```\n\nThis means there are 2 students who are 20 years old, 2 students who are 21 years old, and 1 student who is 22 years old.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to achieve the same result with less code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_students_by_age(students):\n    return dict(Counter(students.values()))\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 21,\n    \"Bob\": 20,\n    \"Charlie\": 22,\n    \"David\": 21\n}\n\nage_count = count_students_by_age(students)\nprint(age_count)\n```\n\nThis will produce the same output as the previous example.",
