  "answer": "**Word Counter Program**\n========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user for a string and prints out the number of words it contains.\n\n```python\ndef count_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a string and prints out the number of words it contains.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    word_count = len(user_string.split())\n    print(f\"The string contains {word_count} words.\")\n\ndef main():\n    count_words()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `count_words` function prompts the user to enter a string using the `input` function.\n2. The `split` method is used to split the string into a list of words. By default, `split` separates the string at whitespace characters.\n3. The `len` function is used to count the number of words in the list.\n4. The word count is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a string. For example:\n```\nPlease enter a string: Hello World this is a test\nThe string contains 6 words.\n```",
