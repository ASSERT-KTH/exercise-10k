  "prompt": "Write a program that generates all permutations of a given list of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates all permutations of a given list of numbers using recursion:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef generate_permutations(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate all permutations of a given list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.permutations(numbers))\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n    permutations = generate_permutations(numbers)\n    \n    print(\"Input List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Permutations:\")\n    for i, permutation in enumerate(permutations):\n        print(f\"Permutation {i+1}: {permutation}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we're using Python's built-in `itertools` module to generate the permutations. The `itertools.permutations` function returns an iterator that produces tuples, so we convert it to a list of lists.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print out all permutations of the input list `[1, 2, 3]`. The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nInput List: [1, 2, 3]\nPermutations:\nPermutation 1: (1, 2, 3)\nPermutation 2: (1, 3, 2)\nPermutation 3: (2, 1, 3)\nPermutation 4: (2, 3, 1)\nPermutation 5: (3, 1, 2)\nPermutation 6: (3, 2, 1)\n```\n\nNote that the number of permutations of a list of length `n` is `n!` (n factorial), so be careful when generating permutations for large lists, as it can be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to implement the permutation generation manually without using the `itertools` module, you can use a recursive approach like this:\n\n```python\ndef generate_permutations(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 1:\n        return [numbers]\n    \n    permutations = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n        remaining_numbers = numbers[:i] + numbers[i+1:]\n        for permutation in generate_permutations(remaining_numbers):\n            permutations.append([num] + permutation)\n    \n    return permutations\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n    permutations = generate_permutations(numbers)\n    \n    print(\"Input List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Permutations:\")\n    for i, permutation in enumerate(permutations):\n        print(f\"Permutation {i+1}: {permutation}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis manual implementation uses a recursive approach to generate all permutations of the input list. It works by selecting each number in the list in turn, removing it from the list, generating all permutations of the remaining numbers, and then inserting the selected number at the beginning of each permutation.",
