  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List of numbers cannot be empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements).\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n6. The average is printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[23.5, 25.2, 22.1, 24.8, 26.3]`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the example list of numbers. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
