  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs arithmetic operations based on user input:\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \").lower()\n\n    try:\n        result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of the operation is: {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation.\n*   It uses if-elif-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the input operation string.\n*   It raises a `ValueError` if the operation is not one of the supported operations and a `ZeroDivisionError` if the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n*   The `main` function gets the two numbers and the operation from the user, calls the `arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result.\n*   It uses a try-except block to catch and handle any `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError` that may be raised.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `add` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is: 15.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `subtract` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is: 5.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `multiply` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is: 50.0`.\n*   Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `divide` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is: 2.0`.\n*   Division by zero: Enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `divide` as the operation. The output will be `Error: Cannot divide by zero`.\n*   Unsupported operation: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `modulus` as the operation. The output will be `Error: Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'.`.",
