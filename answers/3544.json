  "answer": "**Merging Two Lists**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that merges two lists into a new list.\n\n```python\ndef merge_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two lists into a new list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to merge.\n        list2 (list): The second list to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list1 + list2\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\n    merged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Merged List:\", merged_list)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `merge_lists` function takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`.\n*   It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists, creating a new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `merge_lists` function.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nMerged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis program provides a simple and efficient way to merge two lists in Python. The `+` operator is used for list concatenation, which creates a new list without modifying the original lists.",
