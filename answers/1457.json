  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years as input and outputs the compound interest.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates compound interest:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 4% = 0.04).\n        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * ((1 + rate) ** years - 1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years)\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: {compound_interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes three arguments: `principal`, `rate`, and `years`.\n2. It calculates the compound interest using the formula `A = P * (1 + r)^n`, where:\n   - A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n   - P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n   - r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).\n   - n is the number of years the money is invested for.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n4. It calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the number of years: 10\nThe compound interest is: 628.89\n```",
