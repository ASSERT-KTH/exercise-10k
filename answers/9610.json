  "answer": "**Library Simulator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a library, allowing users to add, remove, and search for books. It uses a dictionary to store book information, where each book is represented by a unique ID, title, author, and publication year.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# library_simulator.py\n\nclass Book:\n    def __init__(self, id, title, author, publication_year):\n        self.id = id\n        self.title = title\n        self.author = author\n        self.publication_year = publication_year\n\nclass Library:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.books = {}\n\n    def add_book(self, id, title, author, publication_year):\n        \"\"\"Add a new book to the library\"\"\"\n        if id in self.books:\n            print(\"Book with this ID already exists.\")\n        else:\n            self.books[id] = Book(id, title, author, publication_year)\n            print(\"Book added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_book(self, id):\n        \"\"\"Remove a book from the library\"\"\"\n        if id in self.books:\n            del self.books[id]\n            print(\"Book removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Book with this ID does not exist.\")\n\n    def search_book(self, query):\n        \"\"\"Search for books by title, author, or publication year\"\"\"\n        results = []\n        for book in self.books.values():\n            if query.lower() in book.title.lower() or query.lower() in book.author.lower() or query.lower() in str(book.publication_year):\n                results.append(book)\n        if results:\n            print(\"Search results:\")\n            for book in results:\n                print(f\"ID: {book.id}, Title: {book.title}, Author: {book.author}, Publication Year: {book.publication_year}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No matching books found.\")\n\n    def list_books(self):\n        \"\"\"List all books in the library\"\"\"\n        if self.books:\n            print(\"Library Catalog:\")\n            for book in self.books.values():\n                print(f\"ID: {book.id}, Title: {book.title}, Author: {book.author}, Publication Year: {book.publication_year}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Library is empty.\")\n\ndef main():\n    library = Library()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nLibrary Simulator Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add a book\")\n        print(\"2. Remove a book\")\n        print(\"3. Search for a book\")\n        print(\"4. List all books\")\n        print(\"5. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            id = input(\"Enter book ID: \")\n            title = input(\"Enter book title: \")\n            author = input(\"Enter book author: \")\n            publication_year = int(input(\"Enter book publication year: \"))\n            library.add_book(id, title, author, publication_year)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            id = input(\"Enter book ID: \")\n            library.remove_book(id)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            query = input(\"Enter search query: \")\n            library.search_book(query)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            library.list_books()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program by executing `python library_simulator.py`.\n2. Select option 1 to add a book. Enter the book ID, title, author, and publication year when prompted.\n3. Select option 2 to remove a book. Enter the book ID when prompted.\n4. Select option 3 to search for a book. Enter a search query (e.g., book title, author, or publication year) when prompted.\n5. Select option 4 to list all books in the library.\n6. Select option 5 to quit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store book information. In a real-world library system, you would likely use a database to store and manage book data.",
