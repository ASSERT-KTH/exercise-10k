  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in an Array**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to find the first duplicate in an array.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in an array.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The first duplicate in the array. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] in seen:\n            return arr[i]\n        seen.add(arr[i])\n        i += 1\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\narr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n---------------------------\n\n1. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far.\n2. We use a while loop to iterate over the array.\n3. For each element, we check if it is already in the `seen` set. If it is, we return the element as it is the first duplicate.\n4. If the element is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and move on to the next element.\n5. If we finish iterating over the array without finding any duplicates, we return None.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we are doing a constant amount of work for each element in the array. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might have to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
