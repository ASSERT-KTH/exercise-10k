  "answer": "**Color Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a color guessing game. The program randomly selects a color from a predefined list and asks the user to guess the color. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the color.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef color_guessing_game():\n    # List of possible colors\n    colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"purple\", \"orange\"]\n\n    # Randomly select a color\n    target_color = random.choice(colors)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the color guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a color. Try to guess it!\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \").lower()\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == target_color:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the color in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Incorrect guess. Try again!\")\n\n            # Provide a hint if the user's guess is not correct\n            if user_guess in colors:\n                if target_color in [\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\"]:\n                    print(\"Hint: The color I'm thinking of is a warm color.\")\n                elif target_color in [\"green\", \"blue\", \"purple\"]:\n                    print(\"Hint: The color I'm thinking of is a cool color.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Hint: The color I'm thinking of is one of the following: red, green, blue, yellow, purple, orange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    color_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `color_guessing_game.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python color_guessing_game.py`.\n4. Follow the instructions in the program to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nHere's an example of how the game might play out:\n```\nWelcome to the color guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a color. Try to guess it!\nEnter your guess: blue\nIncorrect guess. Try again!\nHint: The color I'm thinking of is a warm color.\nEnter your guess: yellow\nIncorrect guess. Try again!\nHint: The color I'm thinking of is a warm color.\nEnter your guess: red\nCongratulations! You guessed the color in 3 attempts.\n```",
