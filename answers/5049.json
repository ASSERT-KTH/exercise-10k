  "answer": "**Variance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the variance of a list of numbers using the formula for sample variance:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = \u03a3(x - \u03bc)\u00b2 / (n - 1)\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c3\u00b2 is the variance\n- x is each individual number in the list\n- \u03bc is the mean of the list\n- n is the number of elements in the list\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the variance of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    squared_diffs = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\n    return sum(squared_diffs) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)\n    print(f\"The variance of the list {numbers} is: {variance}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n2. The `calculate_variance` function calculates the variance of a list of numbers by:\n   - Calculating the mean of the list\n   - Calculating the squared differences between each number and the mean\n   - Summing the squared differences and dividing by the count of numbers minus 1 (for sample variance)\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_variance` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This program assumes that the input list is a list of numbers and that the list has at least two elements (since variance is undefined for a single-element list).\n- If you want to calculate the population variance instead of the sample variance, you can modify the `calculate_variance` function to divide by `len(numbers)` instead of `len(numbers) - 1`.",
