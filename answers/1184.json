  "answer": "**Maximum of Three Numbers Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes three numbers as input from the user and prints out the maximum of the three.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the maximum of three numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (float): The first number.\n        b (float): The second number.\n        c (float): The third number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The maximum of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return max(a, b, c)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get three numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Find and print the maximum of the three numbers\n    max_num = find_max(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The maximum of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {max_num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter three numbers when prompted (e.g., 10, 20, 30).\n3. The program will print out the maximum of the three numbers (e.g., \"The maximum of 10.0, 20.0, and 30.0 is 30.0\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `find_max` function uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum of the three numbers.\n* The `main` function gets three numbers from the user, finds the maximum using `find_max`, and prints out the result.\n* The program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers as input. If you want to restrict input to integers, you can use `int` instead.",
