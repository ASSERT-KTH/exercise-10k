  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of linear search:\n\n```python\ndef linear_search(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in an array using linear search.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The list of elements to search in.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] == target:\n            return i  # Return the index of the target element\n    return -1  # Return -1 if the target element is not found\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = linear_search(array, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: We define a function called `linear_search` that takes two parameters: `array` and `target`.\n2.  **Iterate Through the Array**: We use a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `array`.\n3.  **Check for the Target Element**: Inside the loop, we compare each element with the `target` using the `if` statement. If a match is found, we return the index `i` of the `target` element.\n4.  **Return -1 If Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, we return -1 to indicate that the element is not present in the array.\n5.  **Example Usage**: In the `main` section, we demonstrate the usage of the `linear_search` function by searching for an element in a sample array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we need to iterate through all elements in the array to find the target element or confirm that it's not present.",
