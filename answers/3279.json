  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints a calendar for a given month and year using nested for loops:\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef print_calendar(year, month):\n    # Get the calendar for the given month and year\n    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Print the month and year\n    print(calendar.month_name[month], year)\n    print(\"Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\")\n\n    # Print the calendar\n    for week in cal:\n        for day in week:\n            if day == 0:\n                print(\"  \", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{day:2d}\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Test the function\nyear = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\nmonth = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\nprint_calendar(year, month)\n```\n\nThis program uses the `calendar` module to get the calendar for the given month and year. It then uses nested for loops to print the calendar. The outer loop iterates over the weeks in the month, and the inner loop iterates over the days in each week. If the day is 0 (i.e., it's not in the current month), it prints a space; otherwise, it prints the day number.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The `calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)` function returns a matrix representing a month's calendar. Each row represents a week; days outside of the month a represented by zeros.\n2. The outer loop iterates over the weeks in the month.\n3. The inner loop iterates over the days in each week.\n4. If the day is 0, it prints a space; otherwise, it prints the day number.\n\nYou can test the function by running the program and entering a year and month when prompted. The program will print the calendar for the given month and year.",
