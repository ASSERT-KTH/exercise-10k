  "answer": "### Jaro-Winkler Distance Function\n#### Overview\nThe Jaro-Winkler distance is a measure of similarity between two strings. It is a modification of the Jaro distance measure, and gives more weight to prefix matches.\n\n#### Implementation\n```python\nimport jellyfish\n\ndef jaro_winkler_similarity(s1: str, s2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Jaro-Winkler similarity between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n    s1 (str): The first string.\n    s2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The Jaro-Winkler similarity, ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (exact match).\n    \"\"\"\n    return jellyfish.jaro_winkler_similarity(s1, s2)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s1 = \"martha\"\n    s2 = \"marhta\"\n    similarity = jaro_winkler_similarity(s1, s2)\n    print(f\"Jaro-Winkler similarity between '{s1}' and '{s2}': {similarity:.4f}\")\n```\n\n#### Prerequisites\nThis implementation relies on the `jellyfish` library, which can be installed via pip:\n```bash\npip install jellyfish\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThe `jaro_winkler_similarity` function takes two input strings `s1` and `s2`, and returns their Jaro-Winkler similarity as a floating-point value between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (exact match). The `jellyfish.jaro_winkler_similarity` function is used to perform the actual calculation.\n\nNote: The Jaro-Winkler distance is not a true distance metric, as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. However, it is often used as a heuristic measure of string similarity.",
