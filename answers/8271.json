  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Get the numbers from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the sum\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. It then prompts the user to enter two numbers, calls the `add_numbers` function with these numbers, and prints the result.\n\nYou can also use a more concise version:\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", num1 + num2)\n```\n\nThis version does the same thing, but without defining a separate function.",
