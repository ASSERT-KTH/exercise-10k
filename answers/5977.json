  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef combine_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.product(arr1, arr2))\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\narr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nresult = combine_arrays(arr1, arr2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `combine_arrays` that takes two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. It uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays, and returns the result as a list.\n\nIn the example usage, we define two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and call the `combine_arrays` function with these arrays as arguments. The resulting array is then printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\n[(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'c'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\nThis output array contains all possible combinations of elements from the two input arrays. Each element in the output array is a tuple, where the first element of the tuple comes from `arr1` and the second element comes from `arr2`.",
