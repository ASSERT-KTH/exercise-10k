  "answer": "**Swapping Variables without a Temporary Variable**\n=====================================================\n\nYou can swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable by using the following methods:\n\n### Method 1: Arithmetic Operations\n\nThis method involves using arithmetic operations to swap the values. However, it may cause an overflow if the sum of the two numbers is larger than the maximum limit of the data type.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):\n    print(\"Before swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n    a = a + b\n    b = a - b\n    a = a - b\n    print(\"After swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_arithmetic(5, 10)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Bitwise XOR\n\nThis method uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to swap the values. It works by using the XOR operator's property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_xor(a, b):\n    print(\"Before swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n    a = a ^ b\n    b = a ^ b\n    a = a ^ b\n    print(\"After swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_xor(5, 10)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Tuple Packing and Unpacking (Python)\n\nThis method is specific to Python and uses tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_tuple(a, b):\n    print(\"Before swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n    a, b = b, a\n    print(\"After swap: a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_tuple(5, 10)\n```\n\nNote: The tuple packing and unpacking method is the most Pythonic way to swap variables and is generally recommended. The other methods are provided for educational purposes and may not be suitable for all use cases.",
