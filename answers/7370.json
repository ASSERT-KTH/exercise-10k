  "answer": "**Low-Level Data Types: Bytes and Words**\n\nIn this section, we will explore two fundamental low-level data types: bytes and words. These data types are essential in computer programming, particularly when working with binary data or memory management.\n\n### Bytes\n\nA byte is a unit of digital information that represents 8 binary digits (bits). It is the basic building block of digital information and can store values ranging from 0 to 255.\n\n#### Example: Creating and Printing a Byte\n\n```python\n# Create a byte\nmy_byte = 123\n\n# Print the byte\nprint(\"Byte Value:\", my_byte)\n\n# Print the byte as a binary string\nprint(\"Byte Binary Representation:\", bin(my_byte))\n```\n\n### Words\n\nA word is a unit of digital information that typically represents 16, 32, or 64 bits, depending on the system architecture. It is commonly used to store integers, pointers, or other types of data.\n\n#### Example: Creating and Printing a Word\n\n```python\n# Create a 16-bit word\nmy_word_16 = 12345\n\n# Create a 32-bit word\nmy_word_32 = 123456789\n\n# Create a 64-bit word\nmy_word_64 = 1234567890123456789\n\n# Print the words\nprint(\"16-bit Word Value:\", my_word_16)\nprint(\"32-bit Word Value:\", my_word_32)\nprint(\"64-bit Word Value:\", my_word_64)\n\n# Print the words as binary strings\nprint(\"16-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_16))\nprint(\"32-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_32))\nprint(\"64-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_64))\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Create a byte\n    my_byte = 123\n\n    # Print the byte\n    print(\"Byte Value:\", my_byte)\n\n    # Print the byte as a binary string\n    print(\"Byte Binary Representation:\", bin(my_byte))\n\n    # Create a 16-bit word\n    my_word_16 = 12345\n\n    # Create a 32-bit word\n    my_word_32 = 123456789\n\n    # Create a 64-bit word\n    my_word_64 = 1234567890123456789\n\n    # Print the words\n    print(\"16-bit Word Value:\", my_word_16)\n    print(\"32-bit Word Value:\", my_word_32)\n    print(\"64-bit Word Value:\", my_word_64)\n\n    # Print the words as binary strings\n    print(\"16-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_16))\n    print(\"32-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_32))\n    print(\"64-bit Word Binary Representation:\", bin(my_word_64))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will create examples of bytes and words, print their values, and display their binary representations. This helps demonstrate the fundamental concepts of low-level data types in computer programming.",
