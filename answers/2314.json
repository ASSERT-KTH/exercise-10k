  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes an integer year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the given year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a leap year or not.\n* A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.\n* The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks whether it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `2020` - Output: `2020 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `2019` - Output: `2019 is not a leap year.`\n* Input: `2000` - Output: `2000 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `1900` - Output: `1900 is not a leap year.`\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `leap_year.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python: `python leap_year.py`.\n3. Enter a year when prompted to determine whether it is a leap year or not.",
