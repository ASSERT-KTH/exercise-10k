  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms:\")\n    print(generate_fibonacci(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n*   It first handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2.\n*   For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0 and 1) and then enters a loop to generate the remaining terms.\n*   In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two terms in the sequence to the end of the list.\n*   The function returns the completed Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this code with `n = 10`, it will output the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
