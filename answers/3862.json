  "answer": "**Accessing City Population from Dictionary**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that creates a dictionary with city names as keys and their populations as values. It then accesses and prints the population of a specific city.\n\n```python\n# city_populations.py\n\ndef print_city_population(city_populations, city_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the population of a specific city.\n\n    Args:\n        city_populations (dict): Dictionary with city names as keys and populations as values.\n        city_name (str): Name of the city to access.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if city_name in city_populations:\n        print(f\"The population of {city_name} is: {city_populations[city_name]}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No population data found for {city_name}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a dictionary with city names and populations\n    city_populations = {\n        \"New York\": 8405837,\n        \"Los Angeles\": 3990456,\n        \"Chicago\": 2720595,\n        \"Houston\": 2313392,\n        \"Phoenix\": 1732125\n    }\n\n    # Specify the city to access\n    city_name = \"New York\"\n\n    # Print the population of the specified city\n    print_city_population(city_populations, city_name)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the `city_populations.py` program, it will create a dictionary with city names and populations, and then print the population of the specified city (\"New York\" in this case).\n\nOutput:\n```\nThe population of New York is: 8405837\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   The `print_city_population` function takes a dictionary `city_populations` and a `city_name` as input, checks if the city exists in the dictionary, and prints its population if found.\n*   In the `main` function, we create a sample dictionary `city_populations` with city names and populations, specify the city to access (\"New York\"), and call `print_city_population` to print the population.\n*   You can modify the `city_populations` dictionary and `city_name` variable to access different cities and populations.",
