  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and the computer generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'Tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock'):\n        return 'User'\n    return 'Computer'\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()\n        if user_choice not in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nUser choice: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer choice: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'Tie':\n            print(f\"It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'User':\n            print(f\"You win! {user_choice} beats {computer_choice}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Computer wins! {computer_choice} beats {user_choice}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer.\n*   The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n*   The `main` function is the game loop where the user is prompted to enter their choice. It then generates the computer's choice, determines the winner, and prints the result.\n*   The game continues until the user chooses to quit by entering 'q'.",
