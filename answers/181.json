  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_numbers(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += i\n    return total\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of numbers from 1 to\", n, \"is:\", sum_of_numbers(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function called `sum_of_numbers` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. **Initialize a variable**: We initialize a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of numbers.\n3. **Use a for loop**: We use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n4. **Add numbers to total**: Inside the loop, we add each number `i` to the `total`.\n5. **Return the total**: After the loop finishes, we return the `total`.\n6. **Get user input**: We ask the user to enter a number `n`.\n7. **Call the function and print the result**: We call the `sum_of_numbers` function with the user's input and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `5`, the program will output: `The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15`\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will output: `The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55`",
