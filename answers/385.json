  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the distance\n    point1 = (x1, y1)\n    point2 = (x2, y2)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, each representing the coordinates of a point.\n2. It calculates the distance using the Euclidean distance formula: `\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the coordinates of two points.\n4. It calls the `calculate_distance` function with the input coordinates and prints the result.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\n* Input: `x1 = 1`, `y1 = 2`, `x2 = 4`, `y2 = 6`\n* Output: `The distance between the two points is: 5.00`",
