  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space given their coordinates.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): Coordinates of the first point (x, y, z)\n        point2 (list): Coordinates of the second point (x, y, z)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of coordinates\")\n\n    squared_differences = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n    distance = math.sqrt(sum(squared_differences))\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = [1, 2, 3]  # x, y, z coordinates of the first point\n    point2 = [4, 5, 6]  # x, y, z coordinates of the second point\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two lists of coordinates as input and returns the distance between the two points.\n2. The function checks if both points have the same number of coordinates. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The function calculates the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points using a list comprehension.\n4. The function calculates the distance by taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences using the `math.sqrt` function.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space: `point1 = [1, 2]`, `point2 = [4, 5]`\n* Calculate the distance between two points in a 3D space: `point1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `point2 = [4, 5, 6]`\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is suitable for most applications. If you need to use a different distance metric (e.g., Manhattan distance), you can modify the `calculate_distance` function accordingly.",
