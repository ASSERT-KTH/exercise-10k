  "answer": "**Investment Interest Calculator Program**\n=============================================\n\nThis program calculates the interest earned on an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the interest earned on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (float): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The interest earned on the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Investment Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    interest = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n\n    print(f\"\\nInterest earned: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_interest` function takes in the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as arguments.\n2. It calculates the interest earned using the formula `interest = principal * rate * time`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n4. It then calls the `calculate_interest` function to calculate the interest earned and the total amount.\n5. Finally, it prints out the interest earned and the total amount.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount: `$1000`\n3. Enter the interest rate: `5` (in %)\n4. Enter the time period: `2` (in years)\n5. The program will output:\n```\nInterest earned: $100.00\nTotal amount: $1100.00\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes a simple interest calculation, where the interest is calculated only on the principal amount and not on the accrued interest. For compound interest calculations, a different formula would be needed.",
