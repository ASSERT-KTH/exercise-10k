  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns their average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (num1 + num2) / 2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the average\n    average = calculate_average(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The average of {num1} and {num2} is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first number when prompted (e.g., `10`).\n3. Enter the second number when prompted (e.g., `20`).\n4. The program will print the average of the two numbers (e.g., `The average of 10.0 and 20.0 is: 15.0`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple function `calculate_average` to calculate the average of two numbers.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output.\n* The program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers. If you only want to work with integers, you can replace `float` with `int`.",
