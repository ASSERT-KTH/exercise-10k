  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting based on the input provided. This function will take a name as an argument and print out a greeting message. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'greet' that takes one argument, 'name'.\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a personalized greeting based on the input name.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input 'name' is a string. If not, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message.\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"The 'name' argument must be a string.\")\n\n    # Use an f-string to format the greeting message with the input 'name'.\n    # This allows for a more readable and efficient way of embedding expressions inside string literals.\n    greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Print the greeting message.\n    print(greeting)\n\n# Example usage:\ngreet(\"John\")  # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `greet` function is defined with a single argument `name`, which is expected to be a string. It includes a docstring that describes its purpose and the argument it takes.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed using `isinstance(name, str)` to ensure that the input `name` is indeed a string. If not, a `TypeError` is raised with a message indicating that the `name` argument must be a string.\n* An f-string is used to format the greeting message. The expression `f\"Hello, {name}!\"` embeds the value of `name` inside the string literal, creating a personalized greeting.\n* Finally, the `print(greeting)` statement is used to output the greeting message to the console.",
