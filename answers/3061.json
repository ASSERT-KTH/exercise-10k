  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. It provides feedback on the guess, indicating if it's too high, too low, or correct.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    target_number = random.randint(1, 10)\n\n    # Ask the user for their guess\n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n            if 1 <= user_guess <= 10:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Check the user's guess and provide feedback\n    if user_guess == target_number:\n        print(\"You win!\")\n    elif user_guess > target_number:\n        print(\"Too high!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Too low!\")\n\n# Run the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a number between 1 and 10 when prompted.\n3. The program will display the result of your guess.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while` loop to ensure the user enters a valid whole number between 1 and 10. It also uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input, such as non-numeric characters.",
