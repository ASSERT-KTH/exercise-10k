  "answer": "**Delete Duplicate Elements from an Array**\n=============================================\n\nHere is a Python program that deletes duplicate elements from an array:\n\n```python\ndef delete_duplicates(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes duplicate elements from an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The array with duplicate elements deleted.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(array))\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates:\", delete_duplicates(array))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `delete_duplicates` function takes an array as input and converts it to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n2. The set is then converted back to a list using the `list()` function.\n3. The resulting list is returned by the function.\n\n**Note**\n--------\n\n* This program assumes that the order of elements in the array is not important. If the order is important, a different approach is needed.\n* This program also assumes that the array elements are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in a dictionary. If the array elements are not hashable (e.g., lists or dictionaries), a different approach is needed.\n\n**Alternative Approach**\n------------------------\n\nIf the order of elements is important, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\ndef delete_duplicates_ordered(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes duplicate elements from an array while preserving order.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The array with duplicate elements deleted.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in array if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates:\", delete_duplicates_ordered(array))\n```\n\nThis approach uses a list comprehension to iterate over the array and add each element to the result list only if it has not been seen before. The `seen` set is used to keep track of the elements that have been seen.",
