  "answer": "### First Duplicate Function\n#### Description\nThis function finds the first duplicate in an array of integers. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the elements it has seen. If it encounters an element it has seen before, it immediately returns that element as the first duplicate. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a duplicate, it returns None.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or None: The first duplicate integer in the array, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(arr)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate in the array is {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found in the array\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have seen so far.\n2. We iterate through each number `num` in the input array `arr`.\n3. For each `num`, we check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n4. If `num` is in the `seen` set, it means we have encountered this number before, so we return it as the first duplicate.\n5. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the `seen` set and continue to the next number.\n6. If we iterate through the entire array without finding a duplicate, we return None.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in the array.\n\n#### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of unique elements in the input array. This is because in the worst case, we may need to store every element in the `seen` set.",
