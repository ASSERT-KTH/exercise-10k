  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Function**\n======================================\n\nThe following function uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence of two given strings.\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common subsequence of two given strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = len(str1)\n    n = len(str2)\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the 2D array in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    # Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order\n    return \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"AGGTAB\"\n    str2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\n    print(\"Longest Common Subsequence:\", longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively. This array stores the lengths of common subsequences.\n2.  Fill the 2D array in a bottom-up manner by comparing characters from `str1` and `str2`. If the characters match, the length of the common subsequence is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the maximum length from the previous cells is taken.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence by tracing back the 2D array from the bottom-right cell to the top-left cell. When characters match, add the character to the subsequence and move diagonally up and left. When characters do not match, move up or left based on which cell has a greater value.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence as a string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. This is because we fill the 2D array in a bottom-up manner and then reconstruct the longest common subsequence.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n--------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), which is the size of the 2D array used to store the lengths of common subsequences.",
