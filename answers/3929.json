  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns the area of the triangle.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers.\")\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two parameters: `base` and `height`, both of which are expected to be positive numbers.\n*   The function first checks if the base and height are positive. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The area of the triangle is calculated using the formula `0.5 * base * height`.\n*   The `main` function gets the base and height from the user, calls `calculate_triangle_area`, and prints the result.\n*   If a `ValueError` is raised, the `main` function catches it and prints the error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter the base of the triangle: 5\n    Enter the height of the triangle: 6\n    The area of the triangle is: 15.0\n*   Enter the base of the triangle: -5\n    Enter the height of the triangle: 6\n    Base and height must be positive numbers.",
