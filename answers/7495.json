  "prompt": "Declare a boolean variable and use it in a conditional statement to print out a message.",
  "answer": "**Boolean Variable and Conditional Statement Example**\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable\nis_admin = True\n\n# Use the boolean variable in a conditional statement\nif is_admin:\n    print(\"You are an administrator.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not an administrator.\")\n```\nIn this example, the `is_admin` variable is set to `True`. The `if` statement checks the value of `is_admin` and prints \"You are an administrator.\" since it is `True`. If `is_admin` were set to `False`, it would print \"You are not an administrator.\" instead.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nYou can use this code in a user authentication system to determine whether a user has administrative privileges or not. Simply set the `is_admin` variable based on the user's role or permissions, and the `if` statement will handle the rest.",
