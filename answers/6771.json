  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. The program should ask for the user's name, then prompt them to roll the dice. After rolling, it should display the result, including the total of the two dice and a message based on the total (e.g., 'Good roll!' if the total is 7 or 11, 'Better luck next time!' if the total is 2, 3, or 12, and 'Okay roll!' for any other total). The program should use input/output operations to interact with the user.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    \"\"\"Simulate rolling two six-sided dice.\"\"\"\n    dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    return dice1, dice2\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to interact with the user.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator!\")\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPress 'r' to roll the dice, or 'q' to quit.\")\n        choice = input().lower()\n        if choice == 'q':\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        elif choice == 'r':\n            dice1, dice2 = roll_dice()\n            total = dice1 + dice2\n            print(f\"\\nYou rolled a {dice1} and a {dice2} for a total of {total}.\")\n\n            if total in [7, 11]:\n                print(\"Good roll!\")\n            elif total in [2, 3, 12]:\n                print(\"Better luck next time!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Okay roll!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including importing the `random` module, defining the `roll_dice` and `main` functions, interacting with the user, rolling the dice, displaying the result, and providing a message based on the total.",
