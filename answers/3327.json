  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n```\ndef get_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = []\n    for n in numbers:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            even_numbers.append(n)\n    return even_numbers\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(even_numbers)\n```\nThis code defines a function `get_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input, filters out the even numbers, and returns them as a new list. The main part of the code calls this function with a sample list of numbers and prints the result.",
