  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n=====================================================\n\nHere is a simple Python program to calculate the average of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the `len` function to get the count of numbers.\n4. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the numbers in the example list.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list may contain other types of data, you should add error checking to handle those cases.",
