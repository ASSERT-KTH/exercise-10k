  "prompt": "Write a function to find the maximum contiguous subarray of an array of integers. The function should take an array as input and return the maximum sum of a subarray. If the array is empty, return 0.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the specifications:\n```\ndef maxSubArray(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    for num in nums:\n        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n\n    return max_sum\n```\nI've followed the specifications carefully to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
