  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker**\n=========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that checks if a given number is prime using if/else statements.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it's prime, so the function returns `True`.\n6. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number.\n7. The `is_prime` function is called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 7 or 11, to see the program confirm that it's prime.\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 4 or 6, to see the program confirm that it's not prime.\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0 or 1, to see the program confirm that it's not prime.",
