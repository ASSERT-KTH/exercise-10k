Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator.

Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` as the operator. The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n2. Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `-` as the operator. The output will be `10 - 5 = 5.0`.\n3. Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` as the operator. The output will be `10 * 5 = 50.0`.\n4. Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` as the operator. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.\n5. Invalid Operator: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `%` as the operator. The output will be `Error: Invalid operator. Must be '+', '-', '*', or '/'`.\n6. Division by Zero: Enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `/` as the operator. The output will be `Error: Cannot divide by zero`.",
