  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message with the user's name and their age in 5 years.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.\")\n    print(f\"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function asks the user for their name and age.\n2. It checks to make sure the age is a valid integer. If not, it asks again.\n3. The `print_greeting` function takes the user's name and age and prints out a greeting message.\n4. It calculates the user's age in 5 years by adding 5 to their current age.\n5. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` and `print_greeting` to run the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter your name and age. After you enter this information, it will print out a greeting message with your name and tell you how old you will be in 5 years.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are currently 30 years old.\nIn 5 years, you will be 35 years old.\n```",
