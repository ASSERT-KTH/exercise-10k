  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a comparator function as input, and returns the sorted array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nfunction sort(arr, compareFunction) {\n  arr.sort(compareFunction);\n  return arr;\n}\n\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconsole.log(sort(arr, (a, b) => a - b));\n```\nThis code defines the `sort` function, which takes an array `arr` and a comparator function `compareFunction` as arguments. The function sorts the array using the `sort` method and the provided comparator function, and returns the sorted array.\n\nThe code also defines an array `arr` with the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and calls the `sort` function with this array and a comparator function that sorts the array in ascending order. The sorted array is then logged to the console.\n\nNote that the `sort` function modifies the original array, so the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is the same as the original array. If you want to preserve the original array and return a new sorted array, you can modify the `sort` function to create a copy of the array before sorting it. For example:\n```\nfunction sort(arr, compareFunction) {\n  return [...arr].sort(compareFunction);\n}\n```\nThis modified function creates a copy of the array using the spread operator `...`, sorts the copy, and returns the sorted copy, leaving the original array unchanged.",
