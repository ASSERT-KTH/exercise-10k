  "answer": "**Reading an Integer and Printing its Square**\n\nHere's an example of how to accomplish this task in Python:\n\n```python\ndef print_square():\n    # Read an integer from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the square of the integer\n    square = num ** 2\n    print(f\"The square of {num} is {square}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_square()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `print_square` function prompts the user to enter an integer using `input`.\n2. It uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer.\n3. Once a valid integer is entered, it calculates the square of the number using the exponentiation operator (`**`).\n4. Finally, it prints the result to the console.\n\n**Running the Code:**\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `square.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python square.py`). When you run the code, it will prompt you to enter an integer, and then it will print the square of that number.",
