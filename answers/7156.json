  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates a student's grade based on their score:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if 0 <= score <= 100:\n        # Calculate the grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and uses conditional statements to determine the grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the score from the user and checks if it is valid (between 0 and 100).\n3. If the score is valid, the `main` function calls the `calculate_grade` function to calculate the grade and prints the result.\n4. If the score is not valid, the `main` function prints an error message.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Enter a score of 92 to get a grade of A.\n* Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n* Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n* Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n* Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.\n* Enter a score of 120 to get an error message (invalid score).",
