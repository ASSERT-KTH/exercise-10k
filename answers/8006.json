  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif 80 <= score < 90:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif 70 <= score < 80:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif 60 <= score < 70:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Score must be between 0 and 100. Please try again.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and display the student's grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is {grade}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n*   It uses if-elif-else statements to check the score against different grade ranges.\n*   The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and displays the result.\n*   It includes error handling to ensure the user enters a valid score between 0 and 100.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  When prompted, enter the student's score (e.g., 85).\n3.  The program will display the student's grade based on the score (e.g., B).",
