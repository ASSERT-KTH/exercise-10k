  "prompt": "Create a program that performs a series of arithmetic operations on two input numbers. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. The program should first ask the user to input two numbers, then perform the operations, and finally print the results in a formatted manner.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get input from user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Perform arithmetic operations\naddition = num1 + num2\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\ndivision = num1 / num2\nmodulus = num1 % num2\nexponentiation = num1 ** num2\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Results:\")\nprint(f\"Addition: {addition}\")\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {subtraction}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {multiplication}\")\nprint(f\"Division: {division}\")\nprint(f\"Modulus: {modulus}\")\nprint(f\"Exponentiation: {exponentiation}\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It gets input from the user for two numbers using `input()` and converts them to floats using `float()`.\n2. It performs the six arithmetic operations and stores the results in variables.\n3. It prints the results in a formatted manner using `print()` and f-strings.\n\nNote that I've used f-strings to format the output, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use the `format()` method instead. For example: `print(\"Addition: {}\".format(addition))`.",
