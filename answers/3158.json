  "answer": "**Checking if a String is a Subsequence of Another String**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function checks if a given string `subsequence` is a subsequence of another string `main_string`. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(main_string: str, subsequence: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a subsequence of another string.\n\n    Args:\n    main_string (str): The main string to check against.\n    subsequence (str): The string to check if it's a subsequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the string is a subsequence, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize two pointers, one for each string\n    main_pointer = 0\n    sub_pointer = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the main string\n    while main_pointer < len(main_string) and sub_pointer < len(subsequence):\n        # If the current characters match, move to the next character in both strings\n        if main_string[main_pointer] == subsequence[sub_pointer]:\n            sub_pointer += 1\n        # Move to the next character in the main string\n        main_pointer += 1\n\n    # If we've reached the end of the subsequence, it's a subsequence of the main string\n    return sub_pointer == len(subsequence)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_string = \"abcdef\"\n    subsequence = \"ace\"\n    print(is_subsequence(main_string, subsequence))  # Output: True\n\n    main_string = \"abcdef\"\n    subsequence = \"aec\"\n    print(is_subsequence(main_string, subsequence))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `main_pointer` and `sub_pointer`, to keep track of the current position in the `main_string` and `subsequence`, respectively.\n2. Iterate through the `main_string` using a while loop.\n3. Inside the loop, check if the current characters at `main_pointer` and `sub_pointer` match. If they do, increment `sub_pointer` to move to the next character in the `subsequence`.\n4. Regardless of whether the characters match, increment `main_pointer` to move to the next character in the `main_string`.\n5. After the loop, check if `sub_pointer` has reached the end of the `subsequence`. If it has, the `subsequence` is a subsequence of the `main_string`, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.",
