  "answer": "### Gas Mileage Calculator\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that will calculate the gas mileage based on user input.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gas_mileage(distance, gas_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate gas mileage.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Total distance traveled in miles.\n        gas_consumed (float): Total amount of gas consumed in gallons.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Gas mileage in miles per gallon.\n    \"\"\"\n    if gas_consumed <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Gas consumed must be greater than zero.\")\n\n    return distance / gas_consumed\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the total distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    gas_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of gas consumed in gallons: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate gas mileage\n        gas_mileage = calculate_gas_mileage(distance, gas_consumed)\n        print(f\"Your gas mileage is: {gas_mileage:.2f} miles per gallon\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gas_mileage` function calculates the gas mileage by dividing the total distance traveled by the amount of gas consumed.\n2. The `main` function gets the user input for the total distance traveled and the amount of gas consumed, then calls the `calculate_gas_mileage` function to calculate the gas mileage.\n3. The calculated gas mileage is then printed to the console with two decimal places.\n4. Error handling is implemented to ensure that the gas consumed is greater than zero. If not, an error message is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the code, it will prompt you to enter the total distance traveled and the amount of gas consumed. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the total distance traveled in miles: 250\nEnter the amount of gas consumed in gallons: 10\nYour gas mileage is: 25.00 miles per gallon\n```",
