  "answer": "**Calculating the Circumference of a Circle**\n=====================================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is `C = 2 * \u03c0 * r`, where `C` is the circumference, `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and `r` is the radius of the circle.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\n    return circumference\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n        print(f\"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_circumference` function takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the circumference.\n2. The function checks if the radius is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. The circumference is calculated using the formula `C = 2 * \u03c0 * r`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_circumference` function by asking the user for the radius of the circle and then printing the calculated circumference.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a radius of 5 when prompted.\n* The program will output the circumference of the circle with a radius of 5, which is approximately 31.42.",
