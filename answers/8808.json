  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes a polynomial and a value as input and returns the result of the polynomial evaluation:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate a polynomial at a given point.\n\n    Args:\n    coefficients (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial, \n                         where coefficients[i] is the coefficient of x^i.\n    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The value of the polynomial at the given point.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for i, coefficient in enumerate(coefficients):\n        result += coefficient * (x ** i)\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coefficients of the polynomial from the user\n    degree = int(input(\"Enter the degree of the polynomial: \"))\n    coefficients = []\n    for i in range(degree + 1):\n        coefficient = float(input(f\"Enter the coefficient of x^{i}: \"))\n        coefficients.append(coefficient)\n\n    # Get the value at which to evaluate the polynomial from the user\n    x = float(input(\"Enter the value at which to evaluate the polynomial: \"))\n\n    # Evaluate the polynomial\n    result = evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The value of the polynomial at x = {x} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis program defines a function `evaluate_polynomial` that takes a list of coefficients and a value `x` as input, and returns the result of the polynomial evaluation.\n\n*   The function uses a loop to iterate over the coefficients and calculate the term for each coefficient.\n*   The term is calculated by multiplying the coefficient with `x` raised to the power of the term's position (starting from 0).\n*   The terms are added together to get the final result.\n*   The `main` function gets the coefficients and the value `x` from the user, calls `evaluate_polynomial` with these inputs, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Evaluate the polynomial 3x^2 + 2x - 4 at x = 2.\n    *   Input: degree = 2, coefficients = [-4, 2, 3], x = 2\n    *   Output: The value of the polynomial at x = 2 is 14.0\n*   Evaluate the polynomial x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1 at x = 3.\n    *   Input: degree = 3, coefficients = [-1, 1, -2, 1], x = 3\n    *   Output: The value of the polynomial at x = 3 is 5.0\n\nTo use this program, simply run it, enter the degree of the polynomial and its coefficients, and the value at which to evaluate the polynomial when prompted. The program will then print the result of the polynomial evaluation.",
