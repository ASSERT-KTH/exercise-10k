  "answer": "**Insurance Premium Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the insurance premium based on the policyholder's age and health status. It uses if/else statements to determine the premium amount.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_premium(age, health_status):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the insurance premium based on age and health status.\n\n    Args:\n    - age (int): The policyholder's age.\n    - health_status (str): The policyholder's health status ('good', 'average', or 'poor').\n\n    Returns:\n    - premium (float): The calculated insurance premium.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base premium amount\n    base_premium = 500.0\n\n    # Age-based premium adjustments\n    if age < 25:\n        age_adjustment = 0.2  # 20% increase for young adults\n    elif age < 40:\n        age_adjustment = 0.1  # 10% increase for adults\n    elif age < 60:\n        age_adjustment = 0.0  # No adjustment for middle-aged adults\n    else:\n        age_adjustment = -0.1  # 10% decrease for seniors\n\n    # Health-based premium adjustments\n    if health_status == 'good':\n        health_adjustment = -0.2  # 20% decrease for good health\n    elif health_status == 'average':\n        health_adjustment = 0.0  # No adjustment for average health\n    elif health_status == 'poor':\n        health_adjustment = 0.3  # 30% increase for poor health\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid health status. Please enter 'good', 'average', or 'poor'.\")\n\n    # Calculate the total premium adjustment\n    total_adjustment = age_adjustment + health_adjustment\n\n    # Calculate the final premium amount\n    premium = base_premium * (1 + total_adjustment)\n\n    return premium\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    age = 35\n    health_status = 'average'\n    premium = calculate_premium(age, health_status)\n    print(f\"The insurance premium for a {age} year old with {health_status} health is: ${premium:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_premium` function takes two arguments: `age` and `health_status`.\n2. The function uses if/else statements to determine the age-based and health-based premium adjustments.\n3. The age-based adjustment is applied based on the policyholder's age group:\n\t* Young adults (under 25): 20% increase\n\t* Adults (25-39): 10% increase\n\t* Middle-aged adults (40-59): no adjustment\n\t* Seniors (60 and above): 10% decrease\n4. The health-based adjustment is applied based on the policyholder's health status:\n\t* Good health: 20% decrease\n\t* Average health: no adjustment\n\t* Poor health: 30% increase\n5. The total premium adjustment is calculated by adding the age-based and health-based adjustments.\n6. The final premium amount is calculated by multiplying the base premium by (1 + total adjustment).\n7. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_premium` function with an example.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses simple if/else statements to determine the premium adjustments. In a real-world application, you may want to consider using more advanced techniques, such as actuarial tables or machine learning models, to determine the premium amounts.\n* The program assumes that the policyholder's age and health status are the only factors that affect the premium amount. In reality, other factors, such as location, occupation, and driving history, may also be considered.\n* The program uses a simple base premium amount and adjustments. In a real-world application, you may want to consider using more complex premium structures, such as tiered premium rates or discounts for certain groups.",
