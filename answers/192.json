  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using coins of different denominations. This program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(amount, coins):\n    # Create a list to store the number of ways to make change for each amount\n    ways = [0] * (amount + 1)\n    \n    # Base case: there is one way to make change for 0 amount (use no coins)\n    ways[0] = 1\n    \n    # For each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # For each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # The number of ways to make change for the current amount is the sum of the number of ways to make change for the current amount without using the current coin and the number of ways to make change for the amount minus the current coin\n            ways[i] += ways[i - coin]\n    \n    # Return the number of ways to make change for the given amount\n    return ways[amount]\n\n# Example usage:\namount = 10\ncoins = [1, 5, 10]\nprint(f\"Number of ways to make change for {amount} using coins of denominations {coins}: {calculate_change(amount, coins)}\")\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n*   We create a list `ways` of size `amount + 1` to store the number of ways to make change for each amount from 0 to the given amount.\n*   We initialize the first element of `ways` to 1, because there is one way to make change for 0 amount (use no coins).\n*   We then iterate over each coin denomination.\n*   For each coin denomination, we iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount.\n*   For each amount, we update the number of ways to make change for that amount by adding the number of ways to make change for the amount minus the current coin.\n*   Finally, we return the number of ways to make change for the given amount, which is stored in the last element of `ways`.\n\n### Time complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the given amount and len(coins) is the number of coin denominations.\n\n### Space complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(amount), because we need to store the number of ways to make change for each amount from 0 to the given amount.",
