Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter the temperature in degrees Celsius and the humidity percentage.\n2. **Temperature-Based Forecast**: The program uses `if-else` statements to determine the forecast based on the temperature:\n   - Freezing: temperature < 0\u00b0C\n   - Cold: 0\u00b0C <= temperature < 15\u00b0C\n   - Mild: 15\u00b0C <= temperature < 25\u00b0C\n   - Hot: temperature >= 25\u00b0C\n3. **Humidity-Based Forecast**: The program adds humidity to the forecast using `if-else` statements:\n   - Dry: humidity < 40%\n   - Moderate: 40% <= humidity < 70%\n   - Humid: humidity >= 70%\n4. **Display Forecast**: The program displays the final weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a temperature of 10\u00b0C and a humidity of 60%, the program will display: \"The weather forecast is: It's cold. And the humidity is moderate.\"\n* If the user enters a temperature of 30\u00b0C and a humidity of 80%, the program will display: \"The weather forecast is: It's hot. And it's humid.\"",
