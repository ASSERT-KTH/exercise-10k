  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the income and tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax amount based on the income and tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income amount.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 25% = 0.25).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (in %): \")) / 100\n\n    # Calculate tax amount\n    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)\n\n    # Display result\n    print(f\"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Net income: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes two arguments: `income` and `tax_rate`.\n2. It calculates the tax amount by multiplying the income by the tax rate.\n3. The `main` function gets user input for income and tax rate.\n4. It calls the `calculate_tax` function to calculate the tax amount.\n5. It displays the tax amount and net income (income minus tax amount).\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter your income: $50000\nEnter the tax rate (in %): 25\nTax amount: $12500.00\nNet income: $37500.00\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes a simple tax calculation and does not account for other factors that may affect tax liability, such as deductions and exemptions.",
