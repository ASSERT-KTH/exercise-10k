  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting message.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting message based on the input provided. This will help you understand how to approach similar tasks in the future. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'print_greeting' that takes one argument, 'name'.\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a personalized greeting message.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input 'name' is a string. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input 'name' must be a string.\")\n\n    # Now, we use the print function to output a greeting message with the provided name.\n    # We use an f-string to insert the 'name' variable into the string.\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome to our program.\")\n\n# Test the function with a sample name.\nprint_greeting(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_greeting` is defined with a parameter `name` to accept the user's name and includes a docstring that explains its purpose, the type of argument it expects, and what it returns.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed using `isinstance(name, str)` to ensure the input `name` is a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n* The function uses an f-string to format the greeting message, allowing the `name` variable to be embedded directly into the string, making the code more readable and efficient.\n* An example usage of the function is provided by calling `print_greeting(\"John\")`, demonstrating how to use the function with a specific name.",
