  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient and remainder of their division:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient and remainder of their division.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    \n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Call the divide_numbers function\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        \n        # Print the results\n        print(f\"The quotient of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient}\")\n        print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input, checks if the divisor is zero (to avoid a division by zero error), calculates the quotient and remainder using the `//` and `%` operators, and returns the results as a tuple. The `main` function gets user input, calls `divide_numbers`, and prints the results. If the user enters a divisor of zero, the program catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.",
