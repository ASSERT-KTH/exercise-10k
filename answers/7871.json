  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a word contains a specific character using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of how you can write a program in Python that checks if a word contains a specific character:\n\n```python\ndef check_character(word, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a word contains a specific character.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to check.\n        char (str): The character to look for.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the word contains the character, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if char in word:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\nword = input(\"Enter a word: \")\nchar = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n\nif check_character(word, char):\n    print(f\"The word '{word}' contains the character '{char}'.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The word '{word}' does not contain the character '{char}'.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `check_character` that takes a word and a character as arguments. It uses a conditional statement to check if the character is in the word. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The example usage at the end shows how to use this function with user input.\n\nAlternatively, you can simplify the `check_character` function to just return the result of the `in` operator, like this:\n\n```python\ndef check_character(word, char):\n    return char in word\n```\n\nThis version of the function does exactly the same thing as the original, but it's a bit more concise.",
