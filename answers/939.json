  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax based on the income using if/else statements. The tax rates are as follows:\n\n* 0% tax for income less than $10,000\n* 10% tax for income between $10,000 and $20,000\n* 20% tax for income between $20,000 and $50,000\n* 30% tax for income above $50,000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax based on the income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income < 10000:\n        tax = 0\n    elif income < 20000:\n        tax = income * 0.10\n    elif income < 50000:\n        tax = income * 0.20\n    else:\n        tax = income * 0.30\n\n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter an income of $15,000: The program will calculate a tax of $1,500 (10% of $15,000).\n* Enter an income of $30,000: The program will calculate a tax of $6,000 (20% of $30,000).\n* Enter an income of $60,000: The program will calculate a tax of $18,000 (30% of $60,000).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple if/else statement to determine the tax rate based on the income.\n* The tax rates are hardcoded into the program, but could be easily modified or replaced with a more complex calculation if needed.\n* The program uses the `float` data type to handle decimal values for income and tax.",
