  "prompt": "Create a function that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. The function should take in the user's choice and return the result of the game.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. This function will take the user's choice as input and return the result of the game. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_rock_paper_scissors(user_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.\n    \n    Args:\n        user_choice (str): The user's choice. It can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The result of the game.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we define the possible choices in a list\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n\n    # We check if the user's choice is valid\n    if user_choice not in choices:\n        return \"Invalid choice. Please choose 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\"\n\n    # Then, we generate the computer's choice randomly\n    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n    # We print out the user's choice and the computer's choice\n    print(f\"\\nUser chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n\n    # We determine the winner based on the game's rules\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        # If both choices are the same, it's a tie\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        # If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the user wins\n        return \"User wins!\"\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, the computer wins\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(play_rock_paper_scissors('rock'))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `play_rock_paper_scissors` starts by defining the possible choices in a list `choices`. It then checks if the user's choice `user_choice` is valid by ensuring it is in the `choices` list.\n* If the user's choice is valid, the function generates the computer's choice randomly using `random.choice(choices)` and stores it in `computer_choice`.\n* The function then determines the winner based on the game's rules by comparing `user_choice` and `computer_choice`. If both choices are the same, it's a tie. Otherwise, the function checks if `user_choice` beats `computer_choice` and returns the result accordingly.\n* Finally, the function returns the result of the game as a string, indicating whether the user wins, the computer wins, or it's a tie.",
