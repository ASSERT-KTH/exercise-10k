  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student grades as input and calculates the average grade for each student. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should then print out the student names and their corresponding average grades.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the provided specification:\n\n```python\n# Importing Modules\nimport statistics\n\n# Defining a Function\ndef student_average(grades):\n    for name, grade_list in grades.items():\n        average = statistics.mean(grade_list)\n        print(f\"Student: {name}, Average Grade: {average}\")\n\n# Main Program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    grades = {\n        \"Alice\": [90, 85, 95],\n        \"Bob\": [80, 75, 90],\n        \"Charlie\": [70, 65, 80],\n    }\n\n    print(\"Average Grades:\")\n    student_average(grades)\n```\n\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including importing the `statistics` module, defining the `student_average` function, and using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure the main program only runs when the script is executed directly. The main program creates a dictionary of student grades, prints a header, and calls the `student_average` function to calculate and print the average grades for each student.",
