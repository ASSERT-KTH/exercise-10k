  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\nHere's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game allows the user to play against the computer.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors)\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the user's choice (rock, paper, or scissors)\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nYou win!\n```",
