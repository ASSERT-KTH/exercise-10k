  "answer": "**Array Intersection Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the intersection of two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both input arrays.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef array_intersection(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the intersection of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array containing the intersection of arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    intersection = array_intersection(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `array_intersection` function takes two input arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. We convert each array to a set using the `set()` function, which automatically removes any duplicate elements.\n3. We use the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both sets.\n4. We convert the resulting set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `array_intersection` function with two sample arrays and print the resulting intersection.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nIntersection: [4, 5]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the intersection array may not be the same as their original order in the input arrays, since sets are unordered data structures. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to filter the elements of one array based on their presence in the other array.",
