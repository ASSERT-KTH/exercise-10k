  "answer": "**Permutation Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\nThis program calculates the permutation of a given number of objects taken a given number at a time. The permutation formula is nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects taken at a time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_permutation(n, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the permutation of a given number of objects taken a given number at a time.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The total number of objects.\n        r (int): The number of objects taken at a time.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The permutation of n objects taken r at a time.\n    \"\"\"\n    if r > n:\n        raise ValueError(\"r cannot be greater than n\")\n    permutation = math.factorial(n) // math.factorial(n - r)\n    return permutation\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the total number of objects: \"))\n    r = int(input(\"Enter the number of objects taken at a time: \"))\n    try:\n        permutation = calculate_permutation(n, r)\n        print(f\"The permutation of {n} objects taken {r} at a time is: {permutation}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_permutation` function takes two arguments: `n` (the total number of objects) and `r` (the number of objects taken at a time).\n2. It checks if `r` is greater than `n` and raises a `ValueError` if true, since permutation is not defined in this case.\n3. It calculates the permutation using the formula nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where `math.factorial` is used to calculate the factorials.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage by prompting the user to input `n` and `r`, then calls the `calculate_permutation` function and prints the result.\n\n### Usage\nRun the program, enter the total number of objects (`n`) and the number of objects taken at a time (`r`) when prompted, and it will display the permutation. For example:\n```\nEnter the total number of objects: 5\nEnter the number of objects taken at a time: 3\nThe permutation of 5 objects taken 3 at a time is: 60\n```",
