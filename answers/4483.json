  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates a random number between 1 and 100, then asks the user to guess the number. After each guess, it tells the user if their guess is too high or too low.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.\")\n            break\n        # Check if the user's guess is too high\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try a lower number.\")\n        # Check if the user's guess is too low\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `guess_number` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The user's guess is converted to an integer using `int(user_guess)`. If the conversion fails (i.e., the user enters something that's not a number), the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n4. The program checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, the program prints a congratulatory message and breaks out of the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is not correct, the program checks if it's too high or too low and prints a corresponding message.\n6. The loop continues until the user correctly guesses the number.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nTo run the code, save it to a file (e.g., `guess_number.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python guess_number.py`). Then, follow the prompts to play the game.",
