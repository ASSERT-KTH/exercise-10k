  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a user's name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Read the user's name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Read the user's age\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print out a greeting message with their name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n```\n\n### How it works\n1. The `input()` function is used to read the user's input.\n2. The `int()` function is used to convert the user's age from a string to an integer, since `input()` always returns a string.\n3. The `print()` function is used to print out a greeting message with the user's name and age. The `f-string` syntax is used to format the string with the user's name and age.\n\n### Example usage\nWhen you run this program, it will first prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will then prompt you to enter your age. After you enter your age and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name and age.\n\nFor example:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```\n\n### Note\nThis program does not include any error checking or handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to make sure the user enters valid input (e.g., a non-negative integer for their age).",
