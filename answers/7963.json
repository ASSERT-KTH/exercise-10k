Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1.  **write\\_to\\_file function:** This function takes a filename and content as input and writes the content to the file using the `open()` function in write mode (`'w'`).\n2.  **read\\_from\\_file function:** This function takes a filename as input and reads the content from the file using the `open()` function in read mode (`'r'`).\n3.  **append\\_to\\_file function:** This function takes a filename and content as input and appends the content to the file using the `open()` function in append mode (`'a'`).\n4.  **main function:** This function demonstrates how to use the above functions by writing to a file, reading from the file, appending to the file, and reading from the file again.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it, and it will create a file named \"example.txt\" with the content \"Hello, World!\". Then, it will append the content \"This is an example.\" to the file and read the updated content.\n\nYou can modify the filename and content variables in the `main()` function to suit your needs.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   Always close the file after you are done with it to free up system resources. The `with open()` statement automatically closes the file for you.\n*   Be cautious when using the `open()` function in write mode (`'w'`), as it will overwrite the existing file content. Use the append mode (`'a'`) to add content to the end of the file instead.\n*   Handle exceptions when working with files to catch and handle any errors that may occur during file operations.",
