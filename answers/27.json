  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of their squares.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers. This response will guide you through the implementation of this function. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares. We start with 0 because \n    # we haven't added any squares yet.\n    sum_squares = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the input list.\n    for num in numbers:\n        # For each number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.\n        # We use the ** operator to calculate the square of a number.\n        sum_squares += num ** 2\n\n    # After iterating over all numbers, return the sum of their squares.\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(sum_of_squares(numbers))  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We initialize a variable `sum_squares` to 0, which will store the sum of squares of the input numbers.\n* We iterate over each number `num` in the input list `numbers` using a for loop, calculate its square using the `**` operator, and add it to `sum_squares`.\n* After iterating over all numbers, the function returns the total sum of squares stored in `sum_squares`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a list of numbers and print the result.",
