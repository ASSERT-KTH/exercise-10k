  "answer": "### Distance Between Two Points in a 2D Plane\n#### Function Description\n\nThe function `calculate_distance` calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The first point as a tuple of two numbers (x, y).\n        point2 (tuple): The second point as a tuple of two numbers (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance}.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function takes two points as input, each represented as a tuple of two numbers (x, y).\n*   It calculates the difference in x-coordinates (`x2 - x1`) and y-coordinates (`y2 - y1`) between the two points.\n*   It uses the Pythagorean theorem (`math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)`) to calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points.\n*   The result is returned as a floating-point number.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculating the distance between two locations on a map\n*   Determining the distance between two objects in a game or simulation\n*   Measuring the distance between two points in a data visualization or graphing application",
