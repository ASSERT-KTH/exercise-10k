  "prompt": "Given two strings, check if they are anagrams of each other",
  "answer": "**Anagram Checker**\n======================\n\nAn anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem by sorting the characters in both strings and comparing the results. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in both strings and compare the results\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Remove any whitespace from the input strings and convert them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n2.  Check if the lengths of the strings are equal. If they are not, the strings cannot be anagrams, so return False.\n3.  Sort the characters in both strings and compare the results. If the sorted strings are equal, the original strings are anagrams, so return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the sorted strings.\n\nThis solution provides a simple and efficient way to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.",
