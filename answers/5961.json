  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and an index as input, and returns the value at the specified index. If the index is out of bounds, return an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    int findnum(vector<int>& nums, int n) {\n        if (n > nums.size() - 1) {\n            return -1;\n        } else {\n            return nums[n];\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\nNote that I've used the exact syntax and naming conventions specified in the breakdown, including the `class Solution` declaration and the `findnum` function signature. I've also implemented the logic exactly as described, checking if the index `n` is greater than the last valid index in the array, and returning the value at that index if it's not out of bounds. If it is out of bounds, I return `-1` as an error message.",
