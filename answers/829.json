  "answer": "**Checking if a String is a Subsequence of Another String**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven two strings, check if the first string is a subsequence of the second string and return `True` or `False`.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a two-pointer technique to check if a string is a subsequence of another string:\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the first string is a subsequence of the second string.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The first string.\n        s2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s1 is a subsequence of s2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two pointers, one for each string\n    i, j = 0, 0\n\n    # Iterate over the second string\n    while j < len(s2):\n        # If the current characters in both strings match, move the pointer for the first string\n        if i < len(s1) and s1[i] == s2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        # Move the pointer for the second string\n        j += 1\n\n    # If we have iterated over the entire first string, it is a subsequence of the second string\n    return i == len(s1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_subsequence(\"abc\", \"ahbgdc\"))  # True\n    print(is_subsequence(\"axc\", \"ahbgdc\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis solution uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate over the characters in the first and second strings, respectively. If the current characters in both strings match, the pointer for the first string is moved. The pointer for the second string is always moved. The function returns `True` if the entire first string has been iterated over (i.e., `i == len(s1)`), indicating that it is a subsequence of the second string.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the second string, since we only iterate over it once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the function's return value.",
