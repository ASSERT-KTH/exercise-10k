  "answer": "**Partitioning a List into Sublists**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that partitions a list into two or more sublists based on a given condition.\n\n```python\ndef partition_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions a list into two sublists based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sublists where the first sublist contains elements that satisfy the condition,\n              and the second sublist contains elements that do not satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    true_list = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]\n    false_list = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]\n    return [true_list, false_list]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\nresult = partition_list(numbers, is_even)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", result[0])\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", result[1])\n```\n\n**Partitioning into More Than Two Sublists**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo partition a list into more than two sublists, you can modify the above code to use a dictionary where the keys are the possible outcomes of the condition and the values are the corresponding sublists.\n\n```python\ndef partition_list_into_multiple_sublists(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions a list into multiple sublists based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a value that will be used as a key in the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the possible outcomes of the condition and the values are the corresponding sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = {}\n    for element in input_list:\n        key = condition(element)\n        if key not in result:\n            result[key] = []\n        result[key].append(element)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ndef get_remainder(num):\n    return num % 3\n\nresult = partition_list_into_multiple_sublists(numbers, get_remainder)\nfor key, value in result.items():\n    print(f\"Numbers with remainder {key} when divided by 3:\", value)\n```\n\n**Using a More Complex Condition**\n----------------------------------\n\nYou can also use a more complex condition, such as a lambda function or a function that takes multiple arguments.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ndef is_even_or_greater_than_5(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0 or num > 5\n\nresult = partition_list(numbers, is_even_or_greater_than_5)\nprint(\"Numbers that are even or greater than 5:\", result[0])\nprint(\"Numbers that are neither even nor greater than 5:\", result[1])\n```",
