  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in an Array of Integers**\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate in the array, or None if no duplicates exist.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    print(find_first_duplicate(nums))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we've seen so far.\n2. We iterate through the input array `nums`.\n3. For each number, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, we return the number as it's the first duplicate.\n5. If it's not, we add the number to the `seen` set.\n6. If we reach the end of the array without finding a duplicate, we return None.\n\n**Time complexity**\n\n* O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because we perform a constant amount of work for each element.\n\n**Space complexity**\n\n* O(n), because in the worst case, we'll store all elements in the `seen` set.",
