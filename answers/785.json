  "prompt": "Write a program to generate an arithmetic sequence given the first term, common difference, and number of terms.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program to generate an arithmetic sequence:\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic sequence given the first term, common difference, and number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_difference (int): The common difference between each term.\n        num_terms (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the arithmetic sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(num_terms)]\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    first_term = int(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_difference = int(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)\n    print(\"Arithmetic Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function takes three arguments: `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `num_terms`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to generate the arithmetic sequence. The formula `first_term + i * common_difference` calculates each term in the sequence, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num_terms - 1`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the first term, common difference, and number of terms.\n4. It then calls the `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function with the user's input and prints the resulting sequence.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* First term: 2\n* Common difference: 3\n* Number of terms: 5\n\nOutput:\n```\nArithmetic Sequence:\n[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to generate an arithmetic sequence given the necessary parameters.",
