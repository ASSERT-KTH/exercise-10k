  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array as input and returns a string representation of the array.",
  "answer": "Based on the specifications, here is the code:\n```\n// Given an array, returns a string representation of the array\nfunction arrayToString(array) {\n  return JSON.stringify(array);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst str = arrayToString(array);\nconsole.log(str); // Output: [1,2,3,4,5]\n```\nNote that I've assumed that the `JSON` object is available, which is a built-in object in modern JavaScript environments. If you're working in a environment where `JSON` is not available, you may need to use a different approach to convert the array to a string.",
