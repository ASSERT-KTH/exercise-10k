  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, print 'A', if it's between 80 and 89, print 'B', and so on.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n    score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n*   The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function. It prompts the user to enter a score, checks if the score is valid (between 0 and 100), and then prints the corresponding grade.\n*   The program uses a `float` to allow for decimal scores.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a score of 92 to get a grade of 'A'.\n*   Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of 'B'.\n*   Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of 'C'.\n*   Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of 'D'.\n*   Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of 'F'.",
