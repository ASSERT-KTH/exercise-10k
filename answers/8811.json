  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades for three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and store it in a new dictionary. Then, it should print out the student names along with their average grades.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): Dictionary containing student names as keys and their grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: Dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Calculate the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of subjects\n        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n        \n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    # Return the average_grades dictionary\n    return average_grades\n\n\ndef print_average_grades(average_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print out the student names along with their average grades.\n\n    Args:\n        average_grades (dict): Dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the average_grades dictionary\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        # Print out the student name and their average grade\n        print(f\"Student: {student}, Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    grades_dict = {\n        \"John\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 90, \"English\": 78},\n        \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 92, \"Science\": 88, \"English\": 95},\n        \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 76, \"Science\": 82, \"English\": 89}\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the average grades\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)\n\n    # Print out the average grades\n    print_average_grades(average_grades)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average_grades` function takes in a dictionary `grades_dict` where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for Math, Science, and English.\n*   It calculates the average grade for each student by summing up all their grades and dividing by the number of subjects (3 in this case).\n*   The average grades are stored in a new dictionary `average_grades` where each key is a student's name and each value is their average grade.\n*   The `print_average_grades` function takes in the `average_grades` dictionary and prints out each student's name along with their average grade, rounded to two decimal places.\n*   In the `main` function, an example dictionary `grades_dict` is provided to demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_average_grades` and `print_average_grades` functions.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print out the student names along with their average grades, like this:\n\n```\nStudent: John, Average Grade: 84.33\nStudent: Alice, Average Grade: 91.67\nStudent: Bob, Average Grade: 82.33\n```",
