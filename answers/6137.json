  "answer": "**Password Validator**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python script that asks the user for a password and checks if it meets certain requirements.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following rules:\n    - Minimum length of 8 characters\n    - At least one lowercase letter\n    - At least one uppercase letter\n    - At least one digit\n    - At least one special character\n    \"\"\"\n    errors = []\n\n    # Check length\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        errors.append(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n\n    # Check for lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check for uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check for digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one digit.\")\n\n    # Check for special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        errors.append(\"Password must contain at least one special character.\")\n\n    return errors\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    errors = validate_password(password)\n\n    if errors:\n        print(\"Password is invalid. Please fix the following errors:\")\n        for error in errors:\n            print(f\"- {error}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- Enter a password that meets all requirements (e.g., \"P@ssw0rd\").\n- Enter a password that is too short (e.g., \"P@ss\").\n- Enter a password that lacks a lowercase letter (e.g., \"P@SSW0RD\").\n- Enter a password that lacks an uppercase letter (e.g., \"p@ssw0rd\").\n- Enter a password that lacks a digit (e.g., \"P@ssword\").\n- Enter a password that lacks a special character (e.g., \"Password123\").",
