  "answer": "**Closure Function Example**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a closure function in Python, which is a function that returns another function with access to its own scope.\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a closure function with access to its own scope.\n\n    Args:\n        outer_variable (str): A variable that will be accessible within the closure function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A closure function with access to the outer function's scope.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        \"\"\"\n        A closure function with access to the outer function's scope.\n\n        Args:\n            inner_variable (str): A variable that will be used within the closure function.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: A string that combines the outer and inner variables.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"{outer_variable} {inner_variable}\"\n\n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a closure function with the outer variable \"Hello\"\n    hello_function = outer_function(\"Hello\")\n\n    # Use the closure function with the inner variable \"World\"\n    result = hello_function(\"World\")\n    print(result)  # Output: Hello World\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `outer_function` takes an `outer_variable` as an argument and returns the `inner_function`.\n2. The `inner_function` has access to the `outer_function`'s scope, including the `outer_variable`.\n3. When the `inner_function` is called, it combines the `outer_variable` and `inner_variable` into a single string.\n4. The `outer_function` returns the `inner_function`, which can be used as a standalone function with access to the `outer_function`'s scope.\n\n**Benefits of Closures**\n-------------------------\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: Closures provide a way to encapsulate data and behavior within a function.\n2. **Modularity**: Closures enable modular code by allowing functions to be defined within other functions.\n3. **Flexibility**: Closures can be used to create functions with dynamic behavior based on the outer function's scope.",
