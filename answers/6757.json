  "answer": "**Variable Swap Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n\n    Args:\n        a (any): The first variable.\n        b (any): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values\n    a, b = b, a\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    var1 = 5\n    var2 = 10\n    print(f\"Before swap: var1 = {var1}, var2 = {var2}\")\n\n    var1, var2 = swap_variables(var1, var2)\n    print(f\"After swap: var1 = {var1}, var2 = {var2}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `swap_variables` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.\n2. Use tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values of `a` and `b`. This is done by assigning the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a` to `b` in a single statement.\n3. Return the swapped values as a tuple.\n4. In the example usage, call the `swap_variables` function with two variables `var1` and `var2` and print their values before and after the swap.\n\n### Alternative Method\n\nYou can also use arithmetic operations to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. However, this method is not recommended as it may cause overflow issues for large values.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable using arithmetic operations.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use arithmetic operations to swap the values\n    a = a + b\n    b = a - b\n    a = a - b\n    return a, b\n```\n\nNote: The arithmetic method is not recommended due to potential overflow issues. The tuple packing and unpacking method is generally safer and more efficient.",
