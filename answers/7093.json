  "answer": "**Printing a Sequence of Numbers**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that reads a positive integer from the user and prints a sequence of numbers up to that number.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef print_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"Prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i)\n\ndef main():\n    # Read a positive integer from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            n = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if n > 0:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n\n    # Print the sequence\n    print(\"Sequence up to\", n, \":\")\n    print_sequence(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop.\n2. The `main` function reads a positive integer from the user using a `while` loop to handle invalid inputs.\n3. Once a valid positive integer is entered, the program calls the `print_sequence` function to print the sequence up to the entered number.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter a positive integer: 5\nSequence up to 5 :\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
