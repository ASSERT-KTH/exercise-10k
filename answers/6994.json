  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an amount in one currency as input and returns its equivalent in another currency.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this using the `forex_python` library to get the current exchange rates.\n\n```python\nfrom forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates\n\ndef convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):\n    c = CurrencyRates()\n    result = c.convert(from_currency, to_currency, amount)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount: \"))\n    from_currency = input(\"Enter the currency to convert from (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY): \").upper()\n    to_currency = input(\"Enter the currency to convert to (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY): \").upper()\n\n    try:\n        result = convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)\n        print(f\"{amount} {from_currency} is equal to {result} {to_currency}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to run this code:**\n\n1. Install the `forex_python` library using pip: `pip install forex_python`\n2. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `currency_converter.py`\n3. Run the program using Python: `python currency_converter.py`\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the amount, from currency, and to currency\n\n**Note:** This program uses the `forex_python` library to get the current exchange rates. These rates are subject to change and might not be up-to-date. Also, keep in mind that this is a simple program and does not handle all possible error scenarios. For a production-grade application, you would want to add more robust error handling and possibly use a more reliable source for exchange rates.",
