  "prompt": "Create a program that checks the grade of a student based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that implements the grade checking system:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score\"\n\n    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Test the function\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and checks if it's valid (between 0 and 100). If not, it returns an error message.\n2. The function uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to determine the grade based on the score. Each condition checks if the score is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (e.g., `score >= 90`).\n3. If the score meets a condition, the function returns the corresponding grade (e.g., \"A\").\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a score, calls the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the resulting grade.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `grade_checker.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python grade_checker.py`). When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a score, and then it will display the corresponding grade.",
