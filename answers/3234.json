  "prompt": "Write a program to rearrange an array such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem. This program uses two separate lists to store even and odd numbers, and then combines them to form the final rearranged array.\n\n```python\ndef rearrange_array(arr):\n    # Separate even and odd numbers into two lists\n    even = [num for num in arr if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd = [num for num in arr if num % 2 != 0]\n\n    # Combine even and odd lists to form the final rearranged array\n    rearranged = even + odd\n\n    return rearranged\n\n\n# Test the function\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Rearranged array:\", rearrange_array(arr))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n- Initialize two empty lists `even` and `odd`.\n- Iterate through the input array. If a number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), add it to the `even` list. If a number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), add it to the `odd` list.\n- Combine the `even` and `odd` lists to form the final rearranged array.\n- Return the rearranged array.\n\nWhen you run this program with the test array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, it outputs:\n\n```\nOriginal array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nRearranged array: [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]\n```",
