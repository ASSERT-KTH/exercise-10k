  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the maximum number using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses if/else statements to find the maximum of three numbers:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the maximum of three numbers using if/else statements.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n        c (int): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a >= b and a >= c:\n        return a\n    elif b >= a and b >= c:\n        return b\n    else:\n        return c\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the three numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Find and print the maximum number\n    max_num = find_max(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The maximum number is: {max_num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_max` function takes three numbers as input and uses if/else statements to determine which number is the largest.\n2. The `main` function gets the three numbers from the user, calls `find_max` to find the maximum, and then prints the result.\n3. The program uses `float` to allow the user to input decimal numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter three numbers. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 20\nEnter the third number: 30\nThe maximum number is: 30.0\n```",
