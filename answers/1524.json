  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program:**\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python rock_paper_scissors.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n```\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock\n\nYou chose rock, computer chose scissors.\n\nRock smashes scissors! You win!\nPlay again? (yes/no): yes\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): paper\n\nYou chose paper, computer chose rock.\n\nPaper covers rock! You win!\nPlay again? (yes/no): no\n```",
