  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations\n\nBelow is an example code written in Python that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.\n\n```python\n# Declare two variables with numeric values\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\n\n# Perform basic arithmetic operations\naddition_result = num1 + num2\nsubtraction_result = num1 - num2\nmultiplication_result = num1 * num2\ndivision_result = num1 / num2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\nprint(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the results of the basic arithmetic operations performed on `num1` and `num2`.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* We declare two variables `num1` and `num2` with numeric values 10 and 2, respectively.\n* We perform the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, respectively.\n* The results of each operation are stored in separate variables (`addition_result`, `subtraction_result`, `multiplication_result`, `division_result`).\n* Finally, we print the results of each operation to the console.\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\nAddition: 10 + 2 = 12\nSubtraction: 10 - 2 = 8\nMultiplication: 10 * 2 = 20\nDivision: 10 / 2 = 5.0\n```",
