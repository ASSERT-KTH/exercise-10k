  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the initial position, final position, and time as input and returns the distance traveled.",
  "answer": "**Distance Traveled Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the distance traveled given the initial position, final position, and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(initial_position, final_position, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance traveled.\n\n    Args:\n    - initial_position (float): The initial position.\n    - final_position (float): The final position.\n    - time (float): The time taken.\n\n    Returns:\n    - distance (float): The distance traveled.\n    - average_velocity (float): The average velocity.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = abs(final_position - initial_position)\n    average_velocity = distance / time\n\n    return distance, average_velocity\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    initial_position = float(input(\"Enter the initial position (in meters): \"))\n    final_position = float(input(\"Enter the final position (in meters): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time (in seconds): \"))\n\n    # Calculate distance and average velocity\n    distance, average_velocity = calculate_distance(initial_position, final_position, time)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Distance traveled: {distance} meters\")\n    print(f\"Average velocity: {average_velocity} meters per second\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the initial position (in meters) when prompted.\n3. Enter the final position (in meters) when prompted.\n4. Enter the time (in seconds) when prompted.\n5. The program will display the distance traveled and the average velocity.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_distance` function takes the initial position, final position, and time as input and returns the distance traveled and the average velocity.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_distance` function, and prints the results.\n* The distance traveled is calculated as the absolute difference between the final position and the initial position.\n* The average velocity is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time taken.",
