  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal amount, rate of interest, and time as input and returns the interest.",
  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount.\n        rate (float): The rate of interest in percentage.\n        time (float): The time in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100\n    return interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the rate of interest (in %): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the interest\n    interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: {interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the simple interest.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n* Principal amount: 1000\n* Rate of interest: 5%\n* Time: 2 years\n* Simple interest: 100.00\n\nNote: This program uses the formula for simple interest: `I = (P * R * T) / 100`, where `I` is the interest, `P` is the principal, `R` is the rate of interest, and `T` is the time.",
