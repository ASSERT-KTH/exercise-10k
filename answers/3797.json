  "answer": "**Unique Paths in a Grid**\n==========================\n\nThe following function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. This function assumes that you can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef unique_paths(rows: int, cols: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid.\n\n    Args:\n    rows (int): The number of rows in the grid.\n    cols (int): The number of columns in the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of unique paths.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store the number of unique paths to each cell.\n    dp = [[1] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the 2D array.\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            # The number of unique paths to a cell is the sum of the number of unique paths to the cell above it and the cell to its left.\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]\n\n    # The number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner is stored in the bottom-right cell of the 2D array.\n    return dp[rows - 1][cols - 1]\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    rows = 3\n    cols = 7\n    print(f\"Number of unique paths in a {rows}x{cols} grid: {unique_paths(rows, cols)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `unique_paths` takes two parameters: `rows` and `cols`, which represent the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n*   It creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the cell at position `(i, j)`.\n*   The base case is when `i` or `j` is 0, in which case there is only one way to reach the cell (by always moving down or always moving right).\n*   For other cells, the number of unique paths is the sum of the number of unique paths to the cell above it and the cell to its left.\n*   Finally, the function returns the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner, which is stored in the bottom-right cell of the 2D array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(rows \\* cols), where rows and cols are the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(rows \\* cols), where rows and cols are the number of rows and columns in the grid. This is because we need to store the number of unique paths to each cell in the 2D array.",
