  "prompt": "Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to the input number using a for loop or a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to the input number:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i)\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint_numbers(num)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `print` function is used to print each number in the range.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The user is prompted to enter a number using the `input` function.\n2. The input is converted to an integer using the `int` function and stored in the `num` variable.\n3. The `print_numbers` function is called with `num` as the argument.\n4. The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `num` (inclusive) and prints each number.\n\nFor example, if the user enters 5, the program will print the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a while loop to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        print(i)\n        i += 1\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint_numbers(num)\n```\n\nIn this version of the program, the while loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each number. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues until `i` exceeds `n`.",
