  "answer": "### Merging Two Dictionaries into One\n#### Problem Description\nGiven two dictionaries, create a function that returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n\n#### Solution\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use dictionary unpacking to merge the two dictionaries\n    merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}\n    \n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nmerged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The function `merge_dictionaries` takes two dictionaries (`dict1` and `dict2`) as input.\n*   It uses dictionary unpacking (`{**dict1, **dict2}`) to merge the two dictionaries into a new dictionary called `merged_dict`.\n*   If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary (`dict2`) will override the values from the first dictionary (`dict1`).\n*   The function returns the merged dictionary.\n*   In the example usage, we create two dictionaries (`dict1` and `dict2`) and merge them using the `merge_dictionaries` function. The resulting merged dictionary is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Alternative Approach\nYou can also use the `update` method to merge two dictionaries:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\nThis approach creates a copy of the first dictionary and then updates it with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary. The result is the same as the dictionary unpacking approach.",
