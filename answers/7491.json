  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing Student Information\n\nHere is a simple Python program that declares a variable to store a student's name and age, then prints out the values.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables to store student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach Using a Dictionary\n\nIf you want to store multiple student details, you can use a dictionary to make the code more organized and scalable.\n\n```python\n# Declare a dictionary to store student details\nstudent = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 20\n}\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student[\"age\"])\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily add or remove student details without modifying the print statements.",
