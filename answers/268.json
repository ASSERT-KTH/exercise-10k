  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    \n    # Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem\n    distance = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)\n    \n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the distance between the two points\n    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes the coordinates of two points as arguments.\n2. The function calculates the difference in x and y coordinates between the two points (`dx` and `dy`).\n3. The function uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the two points, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`.\n4. The `main` function gets the coordinates of the two points from the user and calls the `calculate_distance` function to calculate the distance between them.\n5. The program prints the calculated distance to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```\nEnter the x-coordinate of the first point: 1\nEnter the y-coordinate of the first point: 2\nEnter the x-coordinate of the second point: 4\nEnter the y-coordinate of the second point: 6\nThe distance between the two points is 5.00\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the coordinates are given as floating-point numbers. If you need to work with integer coordinates, you can modify the program accordingly.",
