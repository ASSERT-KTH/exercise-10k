  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += i ** 2\n    return sum\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nresult = sum_of_squares(n)\nprint(\"The sum of squares from 1 to\", n, \"is:\", result)\n```\n\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. We define a function `sum_of_squares(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we initialize a variable `sum` to 0.\n3. We use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, we calculate the square of each number `i` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n5. We add the square to the `sum` variable.\n6. After the loop finishes, we return the final value of `sum`.\n7. In the main part of the code, we prompt the user to enter a number `n`.\n8. We call the `sum_of_squares(n)` function with the user's input and store the result in the `result` variable.\n9. Finally, we print the result to the console.\n\nFor example, if the user enters `5`, the program will calculate the sum of squares from 1 to 5, which is:\n\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55\n\nThe program will then print:\n\n\"The sum of squares from 1 to 5 is: 55\"",
