  "answer": "### Lambda Function to Calculate Sum of Two Numbers\n\nHere's a simple lambda function in Python that calculates the sum of two numbers:\n\n```python\nsum_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = sum_lambda(5, 7)\nprint(result)  # Output: 12\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a lambda function named `sum_lambda` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.\n*   The lambda function uses the expression `x + y` to calculate the sum of the two numbers.\n*   We then demonstrate how to use this lambda function by calling it with two numbers (5 and 7) and storing the result in the `result` variable.\n*   Finally, we print the result to verify the calculation.",
