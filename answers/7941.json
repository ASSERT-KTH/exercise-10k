  "answer": "### Declaring a Variable to Store a Student's Name and Printing it to the Console\n\nHere's an example code in Python that declares a variable to store a student's name and prints it to the console:\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable to store a student's name\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\n\n# Print the student's name to the console\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. We declare a variable `student_name` using the assignment operator (`=`) and assign it the value `\"John Doe\"`.\n2. We use the `print()` function to print the student's name to the console. The string `\"Student Name: \"` is printed followed by the value of the `student_name` variable.\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\n```",
