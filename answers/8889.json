  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the lengths of the bases and the height of a trapezoid as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the area of a trapezoid\ndef trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height):\n    # The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n    area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n    return area\n\n# Main function with example usage\ndef main():\n    # Get the lengths of the bases and the height from the user\n    base1 = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first base: \"))\n    base2 = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second base: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the trapezoid: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area of the trapezoid\n    area = trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The area of the trapezoid is: {area} square units\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `trapezoid_area.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4. Run the program by typing `python trapezoid_area.py` and press Enter.\n5. Follow the prompts to input the lengths of the bases and the height of the trapezoid.\n\n### Explanation\n- The `trapezoid_area` function takes three parameters: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`, which represent the lengths of the two bases and the height of the trapezoid, respectively.\n- It calculates the area using the formula for the area of a trapezoid: `area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2`.\n- The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `trapezoid_area` function by getting input from the user and printing the calculated area.\n- The program uses `float(input(...))` to get the input from the user, allowing for decimal numbers.",
