  "answer": "**Linear Search Program**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that performs a linear search on an array to find a specific element.\n\n```python\ndef linear_search(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a target element in the given array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The list of elements to search in.\n        target (any): The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] == target:\n            return i  # Return the index of the target element\n    return -1  # Return -1 if the target element is not found\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example array\n    array = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n\n    # Target element to search for\n    target = 23\n\n    # Perform the linear search\n    result = linear_search(array, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `linear_search` function takes in an array and a target element as arguments.\n2. It iterates through each element in the array using a for loop.\n3. If the current element matches the target element, it returns the index of that element.\n4. If the loop completes without finding the target element, it returns -1 to indicate that the element was not found.\n5. In the `main` function, we define an example array and a target element to search for.\n6. We call the `linear_search` function with the array and target element, and print the result.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this linear search program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we need to iterate through every element in the array to find the target element or determine that it's not present.",
