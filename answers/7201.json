  "answer": "**Bank Account Manager Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program manages a bank account using a while loop. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and exit the program.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Manager\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter an amount to deposit.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter an amount to withdraw.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to exit.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account balance and provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.\n* The `main` function runs the program loop, prompting the user for input and performing actions based on their choices.\n* Error handling is implemented for invalid options and insufficient funds.",
