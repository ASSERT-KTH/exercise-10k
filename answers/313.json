  "prompt": "Write a function that flattens a given list of lists into a single list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that combines multiple lists into one, addressing your question with a structured approach and example code. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the nested lists.\n\n    Args:\n        nested_list (list): A list containing other lists as elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A single list containing all elements from the nested lists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the flattened elements\n    flattened = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the nested list\n    for element in nested_list:\n        \n        # Check if the current element is a list itself\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            \n            # If it's a list, extend the flattened list with its elements\n            # This way, we can handle nested lists of arbitrary depth\n            flattened.extend(flatten_list(element))\n        \n        else:\n            \n            # If it's not a list, simply append the element to the flattened list\n            flattened.append(element)\n\n    # Return the flattened list\n    return flattened\n\n# Example usage:\nnested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, [6, 7]]]\nprint(flatten_list(nested_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `flatten_list` function recursively processes each element in the input `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it calls itself with that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flattened` list.\n* The function uses `isinstance(element, list)` to determine whether the current element is a list, allowing it to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth.\n* The `extend` method is used to add all elements from a sublist to the `flattened` list, while `append` is used for individual elements.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to call the `flatten_list` function with a sample `nested_list` and print the resulting flattened list.",
