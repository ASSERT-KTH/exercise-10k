  "answer": "**Getting User Input and Printing a Greeting**\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that asks the user for their name and prints out a greeting:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's name from input\"\"\"\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    return user_name\n\n# Print out a greeting\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting message with the provided name\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! It's nice to meet you.\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(user_name)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `get_user_name` function prompts the user to enter their name and returns the input.\n2. The `print_greeting` function takes a name as input and prints out a greeting message.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_name` to get the user's name and then calls `print_greeting` with the provided name.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nWhen you run this code, it will ask you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John! It's nice to meet you.\n```",
