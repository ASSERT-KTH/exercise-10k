  "answer": "**Simple Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program creates a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4) or 'q' to quit: \")\n\n        if choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n\n        if choice not in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, 3, or 4.\")\n            continue\n\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                result = add(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n            elif choice == '2':\n                result = subtract(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n            elif choice == '3':\n                result = multiply(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n            elif choice == '4':\n                result = divide(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n        except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n            print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Run the program and select addition (1). Enter two numbers, and the program will display their sum.\n2. Run the program and select subtraction (2). Enter two numbers, and the program will display their difference.\n3. Run the program and select multiplication (3). Enter two numbers, and the program will display their product.\n4. Run the program and select division (4). Enter two numbers, and the program will display their quotient. If you try to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle invalid user input, such as non-numeric characters or division by zero.\n* Use descriptive variable names and functions to improve code readability.\n* Consider adding more advanced mathematical operations, such as exponentiation or logarithms, to enhance the calculator's functionality.",
