  "answer": "**Connected Graph Check Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python function that checks if a given graph is connected using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\ndef is_graph_connected(graph: Dict[int, List[int]]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given graph is connected.\n\n    Args:\n    graph: A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the graph is connected, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the graph is empty\n    if not graph:\n        return True  # An empty graph is considered connected\n\n    # Start DFS from an arbitrary node\n    start_node = next(iter(graph))\n\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Perform DFS\n    def dfs(node: int) -> None:\n        visited.add(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                dfs(neighbor)\n\n    # Start DFS from the start node\n    dfs(start_node)\n\n    # Check if all nodes have been visited\n    return len(visited) == len(graph)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a connected graph\n    connected_graph = {\n        0: [1, 2],\n        1: [0, 2],\n        2: [0, 1]\n    }\n\n    # Define a disconnected graph\n    disconnected_graph = {\n        0: [1],\n        1: [0],\n        2: [3],\n        3: [2]\n    }\n\n    print(is_graph_connected(connected_graph))  # Expected output: True\n    print(is_graph_connected(disconnected_graph))  # Expected output: False\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `is_graph_connected` takes a graph represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.\n2. It checks if the graph is empty. If it is, the function returns True, as an empty graph is considered connected.\n3. It starts a DFS traversal from an arbitrary node in the graph.\n4. During the DFS traversal, it keeps track of visited nodes using a set.\n5. After the DFS traversal is complete, it checks if all nodes in the graph have been visited. If they have, the graph is connected, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* The time complexity of this function is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function visits each node and edge once during the DFS traversal.",
