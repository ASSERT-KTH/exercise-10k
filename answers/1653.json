  "answer": "### Tuple Unpacking in Python\nTuple unpacking is a feature in Python that allows you to assign values from a tuple to multiple variables. Here is a basic example of how to use tuple unpacking:\n\n```python\n# Create a tuple\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n\n# Unpack the tuple into variables\na, b, c = my_tuple\n\nprint(a)  # Output: 1\nprint(b)  # Output: 2\nprint(c)  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Unpacking with Different Numbers of Variables\nIf you have a tuple with more values than variables, you can use the `*` operator to capture the remaining values into a list:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\na, b, *rest = my_tuple\n\nprint(a)  # Output: 1\nprint(b)  # Output: 2\nprint(rest)  # Output: [3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nYou can also use the `*` operator at the beginning or in the middle of the variables:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n*a, b, c = my_tuple\n\nprint(a)  # Output: [1, 2]\nprint(b)  # Output: 3\nprint(c)  # Output: 4\n\n# or\n\na, *b, c = my_tuple\n\nprint(a)  # Output: 1\nprint(b)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\nprint(c)  # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Unpacking with Ignored Values\nIf you don't need all the values from the tuple, you can use the `_` variable to ignore them:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n\na, _, c = my_tuple\n\nprint(a)  # Output: 1\nprint(c)  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Unpacking Function Return Values\nTuple unpacking can also be used to assign values from a function's return value to multiple variables:\n\n```python\ndef get_coordinates():\n    return (1, 2, 3)\n\nx, y, z = get_coordinates()\n\nprint(x)  # Output: 1\nprint(y)  # Output: 2\nprint(z)  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\nTuple unpacking can be used in a variety of situations, such as:\n\n* Assigning values from a database query to multiple variables\n* Unpacking data from a file or network stream\n* Assigning values from a function's return value to multiple variables\n\nNote that tuple unpacking can only be used with tuples, lists, and other iterable objects. It cannot be used with dictionaries or other non-iterable objects.",
