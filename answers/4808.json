  "answer": "**Pascal's Triangle Generation Function**\n\nHere is a Python function that generates the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in Pascal's triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            # Each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it\n            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n    return triangle\n\n# Example usage:\ndef print_pascals_triangle(triangle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print Pascal's triangle in a formatted way.\n\n    Args:\n        triangle (list): A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - len(row)), end='')\n        print(' '.join(str(num) for num in row))\n\n# Generate and print the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle\nn = 5\ntriangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\nprint_pascals_triangle(triangle)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n\n1.  Initialize the triangle with all 1's.\n2.  For each row starting from the third row (index 2), calculate the middle elements as the sum of the two elements directly above it.\n3.  Return the generated triangle.\n\n**Example Output**\n\n```\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```",
