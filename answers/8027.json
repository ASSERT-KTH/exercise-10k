  "prompt": "Create a program that prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite hobby. The program should then display a summary of the user's information in a formatted string.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\n# Prompt the user to input their name, age, and favorite hobby\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nage = input(\"Enter your age: \")\nhobby = input(\"Enter your favorite hobby: \")\n\n# Display a summary of the user's input\nprint(f\"Hello {name} your are {age} years old and you love to {hobby}.\")\n```\nThis code uses the `input()` function to get user input and store it in the `name`, `age`, and `hobby` variables. It then uses an f-string to create a formatted string that includes the user's input and prints it to the console.",
