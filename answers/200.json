  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.",
  "answer": "Here's an example implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a while loop in Python:\n```python\n# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the game board with 9 empty spaces\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the game board\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win():\n    \"\"\"Check if there's a winner\"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if ' ' not in board:\n        return 'Tie'\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(f\"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_win()\n        if result:\n            print_board()\n            if result == 'Tie':\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Player {result} wins!\")\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The game board is represented as a list of 9 empty spaces.\n2. The `print_board` function prints the current state of the game board.\n3. The `check_win` function checks if there's a winner by examining all possible win conditions.\n4. The `main` function contains the game loop, where players take turns entering their moves.\n5. The game loop continues until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.\n\nExample use case:\n\n1. Run the program and follow the prompts to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.\n2. Enter your moves by typing a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the space where you'd like to place your piece.\n3. The game will automatically switch between players and update the board after each move.\n4. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the final board state will be printed and the result will be announced.",
