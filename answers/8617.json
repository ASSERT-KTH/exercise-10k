  "answer": "**Word Frequency Counter Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each word in the string. The program converts the string to lowercase, splits it into words, and then counts the frequency of each word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each word in the string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase\n    string = string.lower()\n    \n    # Replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces\n    string = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', ' ', string)\n    \n    # Split the string into words\n    words = string.split()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    frequency = Counter(words)\n    \n    return dict(frequency)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"This is a test string. The string is just a test.\"\n    frequency_dict = word_frequency(input_string)\n    print(frequency_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `word_frequency` function takes a string as input and converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n2. The function uses a regular expression to replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces. This is done to separate words that are connected by punctuation.\n3. The string is then split into words using the `split()` method.\n4. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word.\n5. The frequency dictionary is returned as a regular dictionary using the `dict()` function.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor the input string `\"This is a test string. The string is just a test.\"`, the output dictionary would be:\n```python\n{'this': 1, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test': 2, 'string': 2, 'the': 1, 'just': 1}\n```",
