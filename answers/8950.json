  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nHere's an example of declaring a variable, assigning it a value, and printing out the value in a specific format using Python:\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable and assign it a value\nvariable_name = 123.456\n\n# Print out the value in a specific format\nprint(f\"The value of the variable is: {variable_name:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n*   We declare a variable named `variable_name` and assign it the value `123.456`.\n*   We use the `print` function with an f-string to print out the value of the variable in a specific format. The `:.2f` format specifier rounds the value to two decimal places.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe value of the variable is: 123.46\n```\n\nYou can adjust the format specifier to suit your needs. For example, `:.3f` would round the value to three decimal places, while `:.0f` would round it to the nearest integer.",
