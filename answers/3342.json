  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to sum all even numbers from 2 to 100.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(start, end):\n    \"\"\"Sum all even numbers in the given range.\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    num = start\n    while num <= end:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total += num\n        num += 1\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    start = 2\n    end = 100\n    result = sum_even_numbers(start, end)\n    print(f\"The sum of even numbers from {start} to {end} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, which define the range of numbers to sum.\n2. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the range of numbers.\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division by 2 is 0, the number is even.\n4. If the number is even, it adds the number to the `total` variable.\n5. The loop continues until it reaches the `end` of the range.\n6. The `main` function calls `sum_even_numbers` with the desired range (2 to 100) and prints the result.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of even numbers from 2 to 100 is: 2550\n```",
