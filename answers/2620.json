  "answer": "**Grouping Dictionary Keys by Values**\n======================================\n\nHere is a Python program that groups the keys in a dictionary by their values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef group_keys_by_values(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group the keys in a dictionary by their values.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the original values and the values are lists of keys.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = {}\n    for key, value in dictionary.items():\n        if value not in result:\n            result[value] = [key]\n        else:\n            result[value].append(key)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dictionary = {\n        \"a\": 1,\n        \"b\": 2,\n        \"c\": 1,\n        \"d\": 3,\n        \"e\": 2,\n        \"f\": 1\n    }\n    print(\"Original Dictionary:\")\n    print(dictionary)\n\n    grouped_dictionary = group_keys_by_values(dictionary)\n    print(\"\\nGrouped Dictionary:\")\n    print(grouped_dictionary)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `group_keys_by_values` takes a dictionary as input and initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the grouped keys.\n2. It iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary.\n3. For each value, it checks if the value is already a key in the `result` dictionary. If not, it adds the value as a key and initializes its value to a list containing the current key.\n4. If the value is already a key in the `result` dictionary, it appends the current key to the list of keys for that value.\n5. Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary, which contains the grouped keys.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal Dictionary:\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 3, 'e': 2, 'f': 1}\n\nGrouped Dictionary:\n{1: ['a', 'c', 'f'], 2: ['b', 'e'], 3: ['d']}\n```",
