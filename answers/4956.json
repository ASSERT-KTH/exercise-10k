  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses a dictionary to store word meanings and looks up the meaning of a given word using conditional statements:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with word meanings\ndictionary = {\n    \"apple\": \"A sweet, juicy fruit.\",\n    \"banana\": \"A long, curved fruit that is often yellow when ripe.\",\n    \"cherry\": \"A small, round stone fruit that is often red or yellow.\",\n    \"date\": \"A sweet, brown or reddish-brown fruit that grows on palm trees.\",\n    \"elderberry\": \"A type of fruit that is often used to make jams and wines.\"\n}\n\ndef look_up_word(word):\n    # Convert the word to lowercase for case-insensitive lookup\n    word = word.lower()\n\n    # Check if the word is in the dictionary\n    if word in dictionary:\n        # If the word is found, return its meaning\n        return dictionary[word]\n    else:\n        # If the word is not found, return a message indicating that\n        return \"Word not found in dictionary.\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the word to look up from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word to look up: \")\n\n    # Look up the word and print its meaning\n    meaning = look_up_word(word)\n    print(meaning)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a dictionary `dictionary` with word meanings, a function `look_up_word` that looks up the meaning of a given word, and a `main` function that gets the word to look up from the user and prints its meaning. The `look_up_word` function uses an `if` statement to check if the word is in the dictionary and returns its meaning if found, or a message indicating that the word is not found.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a word to look up when prompted, and it will print the meaning of the word if it's in the dictionary. If the word is not found, it will print a message indicating that.",
