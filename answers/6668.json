  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax on an income based on a given tax rate and income amount.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax on an income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income amount.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g. 20% = 0.20).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax = income * tax_rate\n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Tax Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n\n    # Get income from user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n            if income < 0:\n                print(\"Income cannot be negative.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Get tax rate from user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 20 for 20%): \"))\n            if tax_rate < 0 or tax_rate > 100:\n                print(\"Tax rate must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                tax_rate = tax_rate / 100  # Convert to decimal\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate tax\n    tax = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your income: ${income:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax rate: {tax_rate * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Calculated tax: ${tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Net income (after tax): ${income - tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income (e.g. 50000).\n3. Enter the tax rate (e.g. 25 for 25%).\n4. The program will calculate and display the tax amount, net income, and other relevant information.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple tax calculation where the tax rate is applied directly to the income.\n* In reality, tax calculations can be more complex and may involve multiple tax brackets, deductions, and other factors.\n* This program is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual tax calculations. Consult a tax professional or relevant tax authorities for accurate and up-to-date tax information.",
