  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula for calculating the volume of a cube is `V = s^3`, where `V` is the volume and `s` is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of the side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    side_length = 5.0\n    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_cube_volume` takes one argument, `side_length`, which is the length of the side of the cube.\n*   It checks if the `side_length` is negative, and if so, raises a `ValueError` because a cube's side length cannot be negative.\n*   It calculates the volume of the cube by cubing the `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n*   It returns the calculated volume.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the function to calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5.0.",
