  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed of an object.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled in meters.\n        time (float): Time taken in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Speed in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in meters: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken in seconds: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate speed\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed is {speed} meters per second.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance traveled in meters when prompted (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the time taken in seconds when prompted (e.g., 10).\n4. The program will output the calculated speed (e.g., 10.0 meters per second).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the formula `speed = distance / time` to calculate the speed.\n* It checks for division by zero and raises a `ValueError` if the time is zero.\n* The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any errors that may occur during calculation.",
