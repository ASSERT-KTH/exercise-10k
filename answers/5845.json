  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the user is under 18, print 'You are not eligible to vote'; if the user is 18 or older, print 'You are eligible to vote'",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\n    # Ask the user for their age\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n    # Check if the input is a valid integer\n    while not age.isdigit():\n        age = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age: \")\n\n    # Convert the input to an integer\n    age = int(age)\n\n    # Check the voting eligibility\n    if age < 18:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n\n# Call the function\ncheck_voting_eligibility()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `check_voting_eligibility()` that asks the user for their age.\n2. It checks if the input is a valid integer using a `while` loop. If the input is not a valid integer, it prompts the user to enter a valid age.\n3. Once the input is validated, it converts the input to an integer using `int(age)`.\n4. It then checks the voting eligibility using an `if-else` statement. If the age is less than 18, it prints \"You are not eligible to vote.\" Otherwise, it prints \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n5. Finally, it calls the `check_voting_eligibility()` function to start the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* When the user enters an age less than 18, the program prints \"You are not eligible to vote.\"\n* When the user enters an age 18 or older, the program prints \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* When the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a string or a floating-point number), the program prompts the user to enter a valid age.",
