  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two integers as input and performs all four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them. The program should then output the results of each operation, handling any potential division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get user input\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Perform arithmetic operations\naddition = num1 + num2\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\n\n# Perform division\nif num2 == 0:\n    division = \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\nelse:\n    division = num1 / num2\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Addition: \", addition)\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", subtraction)\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", multiplication)\nprint(\"Division: \", division)\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly, getting user input for two numbers, performing the four basic arithmetic operations, handling division by zero, and printing the results. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
