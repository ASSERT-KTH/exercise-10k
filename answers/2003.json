  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Simulator**\n======================================\n\nThis program simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players. The game rules are as follows:\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game rules\"\"\"\n    if player_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (player_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (player_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"Player wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        player_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if player_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        elif player_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nPlayer chose: {player_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The computer's random choice will be displayed.\n4. The winner will be determined and displayed.\n5. To quit the game, enter 'q' when prompted.\n\n**Notes**\n----\n\n* This program uses a simple random number generator to simulate the computer's choice.\n* The `determine_winner` function uses conditional statements to determine the winner based on the game rules.\n* The `main` function handles user input and displays the game results.",
