  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n\n### Game Overview\n\nThis is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number generated by the computer. The user will have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum number of attempts\n    max_attempts = 6\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    print(f\"You have {max_attempts} attempts to guess the correct number.\")\n    \n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is a valid number\n        if not user_guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Convert the user's guess to an integer\n        user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Your guess is out of range. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            return\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n        \n        # Print the remaining attempts\n        print(f\"You have {max_attempts - attempts} attempts remaining.\")\n    \n    # If the user runs out of attempts, reveal the correct number\n    print(f\"Sorry, you didn't guess the correct number. The correct number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\n# Run the game\nnumber_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the code to start the game.\n2. The computer will think of a random number between 1 and 100.\n3. You will have 6 attempts to guess the correct number.\n4. Enter your guess, and the computer will tell you if it's too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.\n\nNote: This code uses Python 3.x. Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run the code.",
