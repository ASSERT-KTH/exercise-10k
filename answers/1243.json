  "answer": "### Calculating Square and Cube of a Number\n\nBelow are two functions, `calculate_square` and `calculate_cube`, that calculate the square and cube of a given number, respectively. We will then use these functions to calculate the square of the cube of a number.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_square(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the square of a number.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to calculate the square of.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square of the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num ** 2\n\ndef calculate_cube(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cube of a number.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to calculate the cube of.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The cube of the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num ** 3\n\ndef main():\n    num = 5  # Example number\n    cube = calculate_cube(num)\n    square_of_cube = calculate_square(cube)\n\n    print(f\"The cube of {num} is: {cube}\")\n    print(f\"The square of the cube of {num} is: {square_of_cube}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_square` function takes a number as input and returns its square.\n2. The `calculate_cube` function takes a number as input and returns its cube.\n3. In the `main` function, we first calculate the cube of a given number using the `calculate_cube` function.\n4. Then, we calculate the square of the cube using the `calculate_square` function.\n5. Finally, we print the results.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example above, we calculate the square of the cube of the number 5. The output will be:\n\n```\nThe cube of 5 is: 125\nThe square of the cube of 5 is: 15625\n```",
