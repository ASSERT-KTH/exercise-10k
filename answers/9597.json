  "answer": "**Writing User Input to a File**\n====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that reads user input and writes it to a file instead of printing to the console.\n\n```python\ndef write_to_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads user input and writes it to a file.\n    \n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to write to.\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n        while True:\n            user_input = input(\"Enter a line of text (or 'quit' to stop): \")\n            if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n                break\n            file.write(user_input + '\\n')\n\ndef main():\n    filename = input(\"Enter the filename to write to: \")\n    if not filename.endswith('.txt'):\n        filename += '.txt'\n    write_to_file(filename)\n    print(f\"Input written to {filename}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n---------------------------\n\n1. The `write_to_file` function takes a filename as an argument and opens the file in write mode.\n2. The function then enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input.\n3. If the user types 'quit', the loop breaks and the function ends.\n4. Otherwise, the user's input is written to the file followed by a newline character.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user for a filename, adds a '.txt' extension if necessary, and calls the `write_to_file` function.\n6. Finally, the program prints a message indicating that the input has been written to the file.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program and enter a filename when prompted.\n2. Enter lines of text when prompted, and type 'quit' to stop.\n3. The program will write the input to the specified file.\n\nNote: This program will overwrite any existing file with the same name. If you want to append to an existing file instead, change the `'w'` mode to `'a'` in the `open` function.",
