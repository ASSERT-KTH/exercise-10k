  "prompt": "Write a Python program that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are dictionaries with keys 'math' and 'science' representing their grades in these subjects. Calculate the average grade for each subject across all students and print the results.",
  "answer": "**Student Grade Average Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis Python program calculates the average grade for each subject ('math' and 'science') across all students in a given dictionary.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each subject across all students.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): Dictionary with student names as keys and dictionaries with 'math' and 'science' grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: Dictionary with subject names as keys and average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize variables to store sum of grades and count of students for each subject\n    math_sum = 0\n    science_sum = 0\n    student_count = len(students)\n\n    # Iterate over each student's grades\n    for student_grades in students.values():\n        math_sum += student_grades['math']\n        science_sum += student_grades['science']\n\n    # Calculate average grades for each subject\n    average_math_grade = math_sum / student_count\n    average_science_grade = science_sum / student_count\n\n    # Return a dictionary with average grades for each subject\n    return {\n        'math': average_math_grade,\n        'science': average_science_grade\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    # Example dictionary with student grades\n    students = {\n        'John': {'math': 85, 'science': 90},\n        'Alice': {'math': 92, 'science': 88},\n        'Bob': {'math': 78, 'science': 95},\n        'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 92},\n        'David': {'math': 88, 'science': 85}\n    }\n\n    # Calculate average grades\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(students)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Average Grades:\")\n    for subject, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        print(f\"{subject.capitalize()}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_grades` function with an example dictionary of student grades. The program calculates the average grade for each subject and prints the results.\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g., `student_grades.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python student_grades.py`). The output will display the average grade for each subject, rounded to two decimal places.",
