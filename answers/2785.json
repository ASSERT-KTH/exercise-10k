  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the two.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two lists into a new one, addressing your question with a step-by-step solution. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef concatenate_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the two.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to be concatenated.\n        list2 (list): The second list to be concatenated.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list that is the concatenation of list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be lists.\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the built-in list concatenation operator (+) to concatenate the two lists.\n    # This operator returns a new list that contains all elements from both lists.\n    concatenated_list = list1 + list2\n\n    # Finally, we return the concatenated list.\n    return concatenated_list\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(concatenate_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `concatenate_lists` starts by validating the input types using `isinstance()`, ensuring both `list1` and `list2` are indeed lists. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n* It then utilizes the `+` operator to concatenate `list1` and `list2`, storing the result in `concatenated_list`. This operation creates a new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n* The function concludes by returning `concatenated_list`, providing the desired concatenated output.\n* An example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, concatenating two lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, and printing the resulting list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.",
