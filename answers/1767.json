  "answer": "**Calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n=====================================================\n\n### Using the Euclidean Algorithm\n\nThe following function calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_gcd` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n*   It uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCD of `a` and `b` is equal to the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n*   The loop continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` is the GCD.\n*   The function returns the absolute value of the GCD to handle cases where the input integers are negative.\n\n### Alternative Implementation\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library, which also calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation is more concise and efficient, as it leverages the optimized `math.gcd` function provided by the Python standard library.",
