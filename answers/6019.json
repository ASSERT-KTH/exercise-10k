  "answer": "**Text Adventure Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nIn this text adventure game, the player is presented with a series of choices that determine the outcome of the game. The game is set in a fantasy world where the player must navigate through different locations, collect items, and fight enemies to reach the final goal.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the `random` module for generating random numbers\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary to store the game's locations\nlocations = {\n    \"start\": {\n        \"description\": \"You are standing at the entrance of a dark cave.\",\n        \"items\": [\"torch\"],\n        \"exits\": [\"cave\", \"forest\"]\n    },\n    \"cave\": {\n        \"description\": \"You are inside the dark cave.\",\n        \"items\": [\"sword\"],\n        \"exits\": [\"start\", \"dragon\"]\n    },\n    \"forest\": {\n        \"description\": \"You are in a dense forest.\",\n        \"items\": [\"shield\"],\n        \"exits\": [\"start\", \"village\"]\n    },\n    \"village\": {\n        \"description\": \"You are in a small village.\",\n        \"items\": [\"health potion\"],\n        \"exits\": [\"forest\", \"dragon\"]\n    },\n    \"dragon\": {\n        \"description\": \"You are facing a fierce dragon.\",\n        \"items\": [],\n        \"exits\": [\"cave\", \"village\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Define a dictionary to store the player's inventory\nplayer_inventory = []\n\n# Define a variable to store the player's current location\ncurrent_location = \"start\"\n\n# Define a function to display the game's menu\ndef display_menu():\n    print(\"\\n--- Menu ---\")\n    print(\"1. Look around\")\n    print(\"2. Take item\")\n    print(\"3. Go to another location\")\n    print(\"4. Fight the dragon\")\n    print(\"5. Quit game\")\n\n# Define a function to handle the player's choice\ndef handle_choice(choice):\n    global current_location\n    global player_inventory\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        print(locations[current_location][\"description\"])\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        if locations[current_location][\"items\"]:\n            item = locations[current_location][\"items\"][0]\n            player_inventory.append(item)\n            locations[current_location][\"items\"].remove(item)\n            print(f\"You took {item}.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"There are no items to take.\")\n    elif choice == \"3\":\n        print(\"Exits:\")\n        for i, exit in enumerate(locations[current_location][\"exits\"]):\n            print(f\"{i+1}. {exit}\")\n        exit_choice = input(\"Choose an exit: \")\n        current_location = locations[current_location][\"exits\"][int(exit_choice) - 1]\n    elif choice == \"4\":\n        if current_location == \"dragon\":\n            if \"sword\" in player_inventory:\n                print(\"You defeated the dragon!
