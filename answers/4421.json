  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers in the range.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nresult = sum_even_numbers(n)\nprint(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n*   We define a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n*   We initialize a variable `total` to 0 to store the sum of even numbers.\n*   We use a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.\n*   If `i` is even, we add it to the `total`.\n*   Finally, we return the `total` sum.\n*   In the example usage, we call the function with `n = 10` and print the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will calculate and print the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n`.",
