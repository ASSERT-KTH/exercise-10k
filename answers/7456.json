  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs arithmetic operations based on user input:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \").lower()\n\n    # Perform the arithmetic operation\n    try:\n        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `perform_arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n*   It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n*   For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   The `main` function gets user input for the numbers and operation, calls `perform_arithmetic_operation`, and prints the result.\n*   It also handles exceptions for invalid operations and division by zero, displaying an error message instead of crashing.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Input `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 3`, and `operation = 'add'`. The output will be `The result of adding 5.0 and 3.0 is 8.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Input `num1 = 10`, `num2 = 4`, and `operation = 'subtract'`. The output will be `The result of subtracting 10.0 and 4.0 is 6.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Input `num1 = 7`, `num2 = 2`, and `operation = 'multiply'`. The output will be `The result of multiplying 7.0 and 2.0 is 14.0`.\n*   Division: Input `num1 = 9`, `num2 = 3`, and `operation = 'divide'`. The output will be `The result of dividing 9.0 and 3.0 is 3.0`.\n*   Division by zero: Input `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 0`, and `operation = 'divide'`. The output will be `Cannot divide by zero`.\n*   Invalid operation: Input `num1 = 10`, `num2 = 2`, and `operation = 'modulus'`. The output will be `Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'.`.",
