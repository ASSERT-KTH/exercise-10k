  "answer": "**Euclidean Algorithm for GCD Calculation**\n=============================================\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a method for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Here is a Python implementation of the algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1.  The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2.  The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0.\n3.  In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively.\n4.  Once `b` becomes 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n*   Calculating the GCD of two numbers: `gcd(48, 18)` returns `6`.\n*   Calculating the GCD of two numbers with a common factor: `gcd(24, 30)` returns `6`.\n*   Calculating the GCD of two numbers with no common factors: `gcd(7, 11)` returns `1`.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n---------------------------\n\nTo calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Choose two numbers, `a` and `b`.\n2.  Divide `a` by `b` and find the remainder, `r`.\n3.  Replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `r`.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until `b` becomes 0.\n5.  The GCD is the absolute value of `a`.",
