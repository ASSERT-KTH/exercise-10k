  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the net salary of an employee given the gross salary, tax rate, and deductions.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the net salary of an employee:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the net salary of an employee.\n\n    Args:\n    - gross_salary (float): The gross salary of the employee.\n    - tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 20% = 0.2).\n    - deductions (float): The total deductions from the employee's salary.\n\n    Returns:\n    - net_salary (float): The net salary of the employee.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the tax amount\n    tax_amount = gross_salary * tax_rate\n\n    # Calculate the net salary by subtracting the tax amount and deductions from the gross salary\n    net_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount - deductions\n\n    return net_salary\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the gross salary from the user\n    gross_salary = float(input(\"Enter the gross salary: \"))\n\n    # Get the tax rate from the user\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 20 for 20%): \")) / 100\n\n    # Get the deductions from the user\n    deductions = float(input(\"Enter the total deductions: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the net salary\n    net_salary = calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions)\n    print(f\"The net salary is: ${net_salary:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function definition**: The program defines a function `calculate_net_salary` that takes the gross salary, tax rate, and deductions as arguments.\n2. **Tax calculation**: The function calculates the tax amount by multiplying the gross salary by the tax rate.\n3. **Net salary calculation**: The function calculates the net salary by subtracting the tax amount and deductions from the gross salary.\n4. **Main function**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter the gross salary, tax rate, and deductions, and then calls the `calculate_net_salary` function to calculate the net salary.\n5. **Result**: The program prints the calculated net salary.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Gross salary: $50,000, tax rate: 20%, deductions: $1,000\n* Gross salary: $75,000, tax rate: 25%, deductions: $2,000\n\nNote: This program assumes a simple tax calculation and does not take into account other factors that may affect the net salary, such as health insurance, retirement plans, or other benefits.",
