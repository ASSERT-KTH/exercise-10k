The class has methods to add new workouts and nutrition entries, view existing entries, and provide fitness recommendations based on user input.\n\nThe `add_workout` and `add_nutrition` methods prompt the user to enter details about their workout or nutrition, such as type, duration, and calories burned or consumed. The `view_workouts` and `view_nutrition` methods display all existing workouts and nutrition entries, respectively.\n\nThe `provide_recommendations` method calculates the total calories burned and consumed based on user input and provides recommendations to increase or decrease physical activity or caloric intake to maintain a healthy balance.\n\nThe `main` function creates an instance of the `WorkoutTracker` class and provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n1. **Adding a new workout**:\n\t* Select option 1 from the menu.\n\t* Enter workout type (e.g., cardio), duration (e.g., 30 minutes), and calories burned (e.g., 200).\n2. **Adding a new nutrition entry**:\n\t* Select option 2 from the menu.\n\t* Enter food type (e.g., protein), calories consumed (e.g., 300).\n3. **Viewing all workouts**:\n\t* Select option 3 from the menu.\n",
