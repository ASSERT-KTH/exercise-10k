  "answer": "Here is a Python program that divides two numbers and prints the quotient and remainder:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n\n        print(f\"The quotient is: {quotient}\")\n        print(f\"The remainder is: {remainder}\")\n\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a `divide_numbers` function that takes two integers as input, divides them, and returns the quotient and remainder. The `main` function asks the user for the dividend and divisor, calls the `divide_numbers` function, and prints the results. It also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid input.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Enter the dividend: 17\nEnter the divisor: 5\nThe quotient is: 3\nThe remainder is: 2\n* Enter the dividend: 10\nEnter the divisor: 2\nThe quotient is: 5\nThe remainder is: 0\n* Enter the dividend: 10\nEnter the divisor: 0\nError: Cannot divide by zero\n\nNote: This program uses integer division (`//`) to calculate the quotient and the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder.",
