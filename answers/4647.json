  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a person's BMI based on their weight and height. If the BMI is under 18.5, the person is underweight. If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the person is normal weight. If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the person is overweight. If the BMI is 30 or above, the person is obese.",
  "answer": "**BMI Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a person's BMI based on their weight and height, and then categorizes them into one of four weight categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate BMI based on weight (in kg) and height (in meters).\n    \n    Args:\n        weight (float): Weight in kg.\n        height (float): Height in meters.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: Calculated BMI.\n    \"\"\"\n    return weight / (height ** 2)\n\n\ndef determine_weight_category(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine weight category based on BMI.\n    \n    Args:\n        bmi (float): Calculated BMI.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: Weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        return \"normal weight\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        return \"overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"obese\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n    weight_category = determine_weight_category(bmi)\n\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your weight category is: {weight_category}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Underweight**: Weight = 50 kg, Height = 1.7 m\n\t* Output: BMI = 17.30, Weight category = underweight\n2. **Normal weight**: Weight = 60 kg, Height = 1.7 m\n\t* Output: BMI = 20.76, Weight category = normal weight\n3. **Overweight**: Weight = 80 kg, Height = 1.7 m\n\t* Output: BMI = 27.68, Weight category = overweight\n4. **Obese**: Weight = 100 kg, Height = 1.7 m\n\t* Output: BMI = 34.62, Weight category = obese\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the user will input valid values for weight and height.\n* The `calculate_bmi` function uses the formula `BMI = weight / height^2` to calculate the BMI.\n* The `determine_weight_category` function uses the BMI to determine the weight category based on the following ranges:\n\t+ Underweight: BMI < 18.5\n\t+ Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25\n\t+ Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30\n\t+ Obese: BMI >= 30",
