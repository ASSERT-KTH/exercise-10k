  "answer": "**Edit Distance Calculator**\n================================\n\nThe edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform one string into the other.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef edit_distance(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the edit distance between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The edit distance between the two strings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a matrix to store the edit distances between substrings\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(str2) + 1)] for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the base cases\n    for i in range(len(str1) + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(len(str2) + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the matrix\n    for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):\n            # Check if the current characters match\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                # Calculate the edit distance for the current cell\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(\n                    dp[i - 1][j],  # Deletion\n                    dp[i][j - 1],  # Insertion\n                    dp[i - 1][j - 1]  # Substitution\n                )\n\n    # The edit distance is stored in the bottom-right cell of the matrix\n    return dp[len(str1)][len(str2)]\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"kitten\"\n    str2 = \"sitting\"\n    distance = edit_distance(str1, str2)\n    print(f\"The edit distance between '{str1}' and '{str2}' is {distance}.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\nThis program uses dynamic programming to calculate the edit distance between two strings. It initializes a matrix `dp` to store the edit distances between substrings of `str1` and `str2`. The base cases are initialized, where the edit distance between a string and an empty string is the length of the string.\n\nThe program then fills in the rest of the matrix by iterating over the characters of `str1` and `str2`. For each cell, it checks if the current characters match. If they do, the edit distance is the same as the edit distance for the substrings without the current characters. If they don't match, the edit distance is calculated by considering the minimum edit distance for the three possible operations: deletion, insertion, and substitution.\n\nFinally, the program returns the edit distance stored in the bottom-right cell of the matrix.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-----------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.",
