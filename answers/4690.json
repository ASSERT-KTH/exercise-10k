  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python function that uses the built-in `zip` function to find the longest common prefix among a list of strings:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n    strings (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strings:\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = []\n    for chars in zip(*strings):\n        if len(set(chars)) == 1:\n            prefix.append(chars[0])\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return \"\".join(prefix)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"hell\", \"hello world\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hell\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function takes a list of strings as input and checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string.\n2. It initializes an empty list `prefix` to store the characters of the common prefix.\n3. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of the strings in parallel.\n4. For each set of characters, it checks if all characters are the same by converting them to a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. If they are the same, it adds the character to the `prefix` list.\n5. If the characters are not the same, it breaks out of the loop.\n6. Finally, it joins the characters in the `prefix` list into a string using the `join` method and returns the result.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings. This is because it iterates over the characters of the strings in parallel using the `zip` function.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the common prefix. This is because it stores the characters of the common prefix in the `prefix` list.",
