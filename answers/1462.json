  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user, converts it to an integer, and then prints the square of the converted integer.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```python\ndef sq():\n    # Get user input\n    x = input()\n\n    # Try to convert the input string to an integer\n    try:\n        x = int(x)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the square of x\n    y = x ** 2\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(y)\n\n# Call the function\nsq()\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `sq()` that takes no arguments, gets user input, attempts to convert it to an integer, calculates the square of the integer, and prints the result. If the input cannot be converted to an integer, it prints an error message and exits the function. The function is then called to execute the code.",
