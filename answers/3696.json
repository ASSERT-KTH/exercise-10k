  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the discount amount and the final price of an item given the original price and discount percentage.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to calculate the discount amount and the final price of an item:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount amount and the final price of an item.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the discount amount and the final price.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage\n\n    # Calculate the final price\n    final_price = original_price - discount_amount\n\n    return discount_amount, final_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: $\"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount and the final price\n    discount_amount, final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n1. Calculate the discount amount and the final price of an item with an original price of $100 and a discount percentage of 10%.\n2. Calculate the discount amount and the final price of an item with an original price of $50 and a discount percentage of 20%.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function takes two arguments: `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n2. It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage divided by 100.\n3. It calculates the final price by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.\n4. The `main` function gets the original price and discount percentage from the user, calls the `calculate_discount` function, and prints the results.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses the `float` data type to handle decimal numbers.\n* The program uses the `input` function to get user input and the `print` function to display the results.\n* The program uses an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the program is run directly.",
