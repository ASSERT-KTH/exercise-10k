  "answer": "### Function with Closed-Over Variable\n\nHere's an example of a function that returns another function with a closed-over variable in Python:\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a function with a closed-over variable.\n\n    Args:\n        outer_variable (any): The variable to be closed over.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that has access to the outer_variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        \"\"\"\n        A function with access to the outer_variable.\n\n        Args:\n            inner_variable (any): A variable passed to the inner function.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple: A tuple containing the outer_variable and inner_variable.\n        \"\"\"\n        return outer_variable, inner_variable\n\n    return inner_function\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a new function with a closed-over variable\n    new_function = outer_function(\"Hello, \")\n\n    # Call the new function with an inner variable\n    result = new_function(\"World!\")\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(result)  # Output: (\"Hello, \", \"World!\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `outer_function` returns `inner_function`, which has access to the `outer_variable` even after `outer_function` has finished executing. This is known as a closure, and it allows `inner_function` to \"remember\" the value of `outer_variable`.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n*   The `outer_function` takes an `outer_variable` as an argument and returns the `inner_function`.\n*   The `inner_function` takes an `inner_variable` as an argument and returns a tuple containing both the `outer_variable` and the `inner_variable`.\n*   The `outer_variable` is closed over by the `inner_function`, meaning it remains accessible even after `outer_function` has finished executing.",
