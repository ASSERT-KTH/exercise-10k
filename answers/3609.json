  "answer": "**Memoized Factorial Function**\n================================\n\nThe following function uses memoization to optimize the calculation of the factorial of a number:\n\n```python\ndef memoized_factorial(n, memo={}):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using memoization.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n    memo (dict): A dictionary to store the results of previous calculations.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    else:\n        result = n * memoized_factorial(n-1, memo)\n        memo[n] = result\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(memoized_factorial(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(memoized_factorial(10))  # Output: 3628800\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The function takes two parameters: `n`, the number to calculate the factorial of, and `memo`, a dictionary to store the results of previous calculations.\n2. If `n` is less than 0, the function raises a ValueError.\n3. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.\n4. If `n` is already in the `memo` dictionary, the function returns the stored result.\n5. If `n` is not in the `memo` dictionary, the function calculates the factorial recursively and stores the result in the `memo` dictionary.\n6. The function returns the calculated factorial.\n\n**Benefits of Memoization**\n---------------------------\n\nMemoization improves the performance of the function by:\n\n* Avoiding redundant calculations: By storing the results of previous calculations, the function avoids recalculating the same values multiple times.\n* Reducing the time complexity: The time complexity of the function is reduced from O(n!) to O(n), since the function only needs to calculate each factorial value once.\n\n**Note**: While memoization can significantly improve performance for large inputs, it can also increase memory usage, since the function stores the results of previous calculations in the `memo` dictionary. In practice, the benefits of memoization should be weighed against the potential memory usage trade-off.",
