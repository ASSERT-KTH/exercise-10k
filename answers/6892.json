  "prompt": "Create a program that asks for a user's name, age, and location, then prints out a formatted string containing this information.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to get user information\ndef get_user_info():\n    # Ask for user's name, age, and location\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    location = input(\"Please enter your location: \")\n\n    # Return the user's information\n    return name, age, location\n\n# Define a function to print user information\ndef print_user_info(name, age, location):\n    # Print out a formatted string containing the user's information\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name}. I am {age} years old and I am from {location}.\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get user's information\n    name, age, location = get_user_info()\n\n    # Print user's information\n    print_user_info(name, age, location)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. **get_user_info() function**: This function asks the user for their name, age, and location using the `input()` function and stores the input in the `name`, `age`, and `location` variables. It then returns these variables.\n\n2. **print_user_info() function**: This function takes the `name`, `age`, and `location` variables as arguments and prints out a formatted string using an f-string. The f-string allows us to embed expressions inside string literals.\n\n3. **main() function**: This function calls the `get_user_info()` function to get the user's information and then calls the `print_user_info()` function to print out the user's information.\n\n4. **if __name__ == \"__main__\"**: This line checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported as a module in another script). If it is, it calls the `main()` function to start the program.\n\nYou can save this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `user_info.py`) and run it from the command line using `python user_info.py`. When you run the program, it will ask you for your name, age, and location, and then print out a formatted string containing this information.",
