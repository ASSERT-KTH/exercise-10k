  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in the sentence.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef count_words(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a sentence as input and returns the number of words.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    sentence = sentence.strip()\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Return the number of words\n    return len(words)\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\nprint(\"Number of words:\", count_words(sentence))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1.  It first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input sentence using the `strip()` method.\n2.  It then splits the sentence into words using the `split()` method. By default, this method splits on whitespace, so it will separate the sentence into individual words.\n3.  Finally, it returns the number of words in the sentence by getting the length of the `words` list using the `len()` function.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a sentence when prompted, and it will print out the number of words in the sentence.",
