  "answer": "**Printing List Elements in Reverse Order using a While Loop**\n\nHere's a Python program that prints the elements of a list in reverse order using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef print_list_in_reverse(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the elements of a list in reverse order using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be printed in reverse order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    list_length = len(input_list)\n    \n    # Initialize the index to the last element of the list\n    index = list_length - 1\n    \n    # Use a while loop to print the elements in reverse order\n    while index >= 0:\n        print(input_list[index])\n        # Decrement the index to move to the previous element\n        index -= 1\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample list\n    sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    \n    # Print the list in reverse order\n    print(\"Elements in reverse order:\")\n    print_list_in_reverse(sample_list)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n\n1. The `print_list_in_reverse` function takes a list as input and calculates its length.\n2. It initializes an index to the last element of the list (i.e., `list_length - 1`).\n3. The while loop starts with the last element and continues until it reaches the first element (i.e., `index >= 0`).\n4. Inside the loop, it prints the current element and decrements the index to move to the previous element.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `print_list_in_reverse` function with a sample list.\n\n**Output**\n\n```\nElements in reverse order:\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```",
