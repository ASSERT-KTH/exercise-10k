  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target (int): The target element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2.  We calculate the middle index, `mid`, using the formula `(left + right) // 2`.\n3.  We compare the middle element, `arr[mid]`, with the target element, `target`.\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, we return the index `mid`.\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`, effectively discarding the left half of the array.\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`, effectively discarding the right half of the array.\n4.  We repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is greater than `right`.\n5.  If the loop ends without finding the target, we return -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the array.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because with each iteration, we effectively halve the search space.",
