  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input, divides the first number by the second,\n    and returns the quotient and remainder.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the divisor is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the quotient and remainder using the built-in divmod function\n    quotient, remainder = divmod(dividend, divisor)\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    \n    # Call the function to get the quotient and remainder\n    quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n    \n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient and remainder. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calls `divide_numbers`, and prints the results. The program also checks if the divisor is zero to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.",
