  "prompt": "Write a program to demonstrate dynamic typing, where the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that demonstrates dynamic typing:\n\n```python\n# Dynamic Typing in Python\n\n# Declare a variable with an initial integer value\nvar = 10\nprint(\"Initial Type:\", type(var))\n\n# Change the type to float\nvar = 10.5\nprint(\"Type after conversion to float:\", type(var))\n\n# Change the type to string\nvar = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(\"Type after conversion to string:\", type(var))\n\n# Change the type to list\nvar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Type after conversion to list:\", type(var))\n\n# Change the type to dictionary\nvar = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(\"Type after conversion to dictionary:\", type(var))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nInitial Type: <class 'int'>\nType after conversion to float: <class 'float'>\nType after conversion to string: <class 'str'>\nType after conversion to list: <class 'list'>\nType after conversion to dictionary: <class 'dict'>\n```\n\nThis program showcases dynamic typing by assigning different types of values to the same variable `var` at runtime. The `type()` function is used to get the current type of the variable, demonstrating how the type changes dynamically.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We start with a variable `var` assigned an integer value `10`.\n*   We then reassign `var` with different types of values: a float `10.5`, a string `\"Hello, World!\"`, a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and a dictionary `{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}`.\n*   After each reassignment, we use the `type()` function to print the current type of `var`.\n*   The output shows how the type of `var` changes dynamically based on the type of value assigned to it.\n\nThis is a key characteristic of dynamically-typed languages like Python, where you don't need to declare a variable's type before using it. The type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.",
