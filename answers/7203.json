  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program prints a weather forecast for the next 5 days using a while loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Define the weather forecast data\nweather_forecast = {\n    \"Monday\": \"Sunny\",\n    \"Tuesday\": \"Cloudy\",\n    \"Wednesday\": \"Rainy\",\n    \"Thursday\": \"Windy\",\n    \"Friday\": \"Sunny\"\n}\n\n# Initialize the day counter\nday = 0\n\n# Print the weather forecast using a while loop\nwhile day < len(weather_forecast):\n    # Get the current day and weather\n    current_day = list(weather_forecast.keys())[day]\n    current_weather = weather_forecast[current_day]\n\n    # Print the weather forecast for the current day\n    print(f\"Weather forecast for {current_day}: {current_weather}\")\n\n    # Increment the day counter\n    day += 1\n```\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nWeather forecast for Monday: Sunny\nWeather forecast for Tuesday: Cloudy\nWeather forecast for Wednesday: Rainy\nWeather forecast for Thursday: Windy\nWeather forecast for Friday: Sunny\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `weather_forecast` to store the weather forecast data for each day of the week.\n2. The program initializes a `day` counter variable to keep track of the current day.\n3. The program uses a while loop to iterate through the `weather_forecast` dictionary.\n4. Inside the loop, the program gets the current day and weather using the `list(weather_forecast.keys())[day]` and `weather_forecast[current_day]` expressions.\n5. The program prints the weather forecast for the current day using an f-string.\n6. The program increments the `day` counter variable to move to the next day.\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can customize the weather forecast data by modifying the `weather_forecast` dictionary.\n* You can add more days to the forecast by adding more entries to the `weather_forecast` dictionary.\n* You can use a different data structure, such as a list or a pandas DataFrame, to store the weather forecast data.",
