  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the output list should be [0, 2, 6].",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index. This will help you understand how to manipulate lists and perform operations on their elements. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_index(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with elements being the product of the corresponding element in the input list and its index.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over the input list with the index and value\n    for i, val in enumerate(lst):\n        # For each element, calculate the product of the element and its index\n        product = val * i\n        \n        # Append the product to the result list\n        result.append(product)\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(multiply_by_index([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [0, 2, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `multiply_by_index` initializes an empty list `result` to store the products of elements and their indices.\n*   It then iterates over the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `val` of each element. For each element, it calculates the product of the element and its index using `val * i`.\n*   The product is appended to the `result` list using `result.append(product)`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the products of the corresponding elements in the input list and their indices.",
