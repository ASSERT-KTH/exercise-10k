  "answer": "**Evaluating a Boolean Expression**\n=====================================\n\nIn this example, we will evaluate a boolean expression using Python.\n\n### Boolean Expression\n\nLet's consider the following boolean expression:\n```python\nexpression = (5 > 3) and (2 < 4) or (1 == 1)\n```\nThis expression can be broken down as follows:\n\n* `(5 > 3)` is `True`\n* `(2 < 4)` is `True`\n* `(1 == 1)` is `True`\n* The `and` operator has higher precedence than the `or` operator, so the expression is evaluated as `((5 > 3) and (2 < 4)) or (1 == 1)`\n\n### Evaluating the Expression\n\nWe can evaluate this expression using Python as follows:\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression():\n    expression = (5 > 3) and (2 < 4) or (1 == 1)\n    result = expression\n    print(f\"The result of the expression is: {result}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nevaluate_expression()\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will print out the result of the boolean expression.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe expression is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. `(5 > 3)` is `True`\n2. `(2 < 4)` is `True`\n3. `True and True` is `True`\n4. `(1 == 1)` is `True`\n5. `True or True` is `True`\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.",
