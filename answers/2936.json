  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their password until it meets a given set of criteria.\n\n**Criteria:**\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the given criteria.\n    \n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the regular expression patterns for each criterion\n    patterns = {\n        'uppercase': r'[A-Z]',\n        'lowercase': r'[a-z]',\n        'digit': r'\\d',\n        'special_char': r'[^A-Za-z0-9]'\n    }\n    \n    # Check if the password meets each criterion\n    if (len(password) < 8 or\n        not re.search(patterns['uppercase'], password) or\n        not re.search(patterns['lowercase'], password) or\n        not re.search(patterns['digit'], password) or\n        not re.search(patterns['special_char'], password)):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = None\n    \n    # Repeatedly ask the user for their password until it meets the criteria\n    while password is None or not validate_password(password):\n        password = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n        \n        if not validate_password(password):\n            print(\"Invalid password. Please ensure that it meets the following criteria:\")\n            print(\"* At least 8 characters long\")\n            print(\"* Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n            print(\"* Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n            print(\"* Contains at least one digit\")\n            print(\"* Contains at least one special character\")\n    \n    print(\"Password accepted.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program and enter a password that does not meet the criteria (e.g. \"password\").\n2. The program will display an error message and ask you to enter a new password.\n3. Continue entering passwords until you enter one that meets the criteria (e.g. \"P@ssw0rd\").\n4. The program will display a success message and exit.\n\nNote: This program uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The `validate_password` function returns `True` if the password meets all the criteria and `False` otherwise. The `main` function repeatedly asks the user for their password until it meets the criteria.",
