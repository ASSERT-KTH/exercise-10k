  "answer": "**Graph Connectivity Checker**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a given graph is connected or not. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and verify if all nodes are reachable from a given starting node.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, num_vertices):\n        self.num_vertices = num_vertices\n        self.adj_list = defaultdict(list)\n\n    def add_edge(self, v, w):\n        \"\"\"Add an edge between vertices v and w.\"\"\"\n        self.adj_list[v].append(w)\n        self.adj_list[w].append(v)\n\n    def is_connected(self):\n        \"\"\"Check if the graph is connected.\"\"\"\n        visited = [False] * self.num_vertices\n\n        # Start DFS from vertex 0\n        self._dfs(0, visited)\n\n        # If all vertices are visited, the graph is connected\n        return all(visited)\n\n    def _dfs(self, vertex, visited):\n        \"\"\"Perform DFS from a given vertex.\"\"\"\n        visited[vertex] = True\n\n        for neighbor in self.adj_list[vertex]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                self._dfs(neighbor, visited)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a graph with 5 vertices\n    graph = Graph(5)\n\n    # Add edges to the graph\n    graph.add_edge(0, 1)\n    graph.add_edge(1, 2)\n    graph.add_edge(2, 3)\n    graph.add_edge(3, 4)\n\n    # Check if the graph is connected\n    if graph.is_connected():\n        print(\"The graph is connected.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The graph is not connected.\")\n\n    # Create a disconnected graph\n    graph2 = Graph(5)\n\n    # Add edges to the graph\n    graph2.add_edge(0, 1)\n    graph2.add_edge(1, 2)\n    graph2.add_edge(3, 4)\n\n    # Check if the graph is connected\n    if graph2.is_connected():\n        print(\"The graph is connected.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The graph is not connected.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The program defines a `Graph` class with methods to add edges and check if the graph is connected.\n2.  The `add_edge` method adds an edge between two vertices in the graph.\n3.  The `is_connected` method checks if the graph is connected by performing a DFS traversal from a given starting vertex (in this case, vertex 0).\n4.  The `_dfs` method is a helper function that performs the DFS traversal recursively.\n5.  In the example usage, we create two graphs: one connected and one disconnected. We then check if each graph is connected using the `is_connected` method and print the result.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because we visit each vertex and edge once during the DFS traversal.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(V), as we need to store the visited status of each vertex.",
