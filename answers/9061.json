  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks a person's age and prints out a message based on their age group.\n\n```python\ndef check_age(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks a person's age and prints out a message based on their age group.\n\n    Args:\n    age (int): The person's age.\n\n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    if age < 0:\n        print(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n    elif age <= 12:\n        print(\"You are a kid.\")\n    elif age <= 19:\n        print(\"You are a teenager.\")\n    elif age <= 64:\n        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are a senior citizen.\")\n\ndef main():\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    check_age(age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the program works\n\n1. The `check_age` function takes an integer `age` as an argument and uses if/else statements to determine the age group.\n2. If the age is less than 0, it prints an error message.\n3. If the age is 12 or less, it prints \"You are a kid.\"\n4. If the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), it prints \"You are a teenager.\"\n5. If the age is between 20 and 64 (inclusive), it prints \"You are an adult.\"\n6. If the age is 65 or more, it prints \"You are a senior citizen.\"\n7. The `main` function asks the user for their age, converts it to an integer, and calls the `check_age` function.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print \"You are a kid.\"\n* If the user enters `16`, the program will print \"You are a teenager.\"\n* If the user enters `30`, the program will print \"You are an adult.\"\n* If the user enters `70`, the program will print \"You are a senior citizen.\"",
