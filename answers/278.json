  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the discount amount and selling price of a product given its original price and discount percentage.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount amount and selling price of a product.\n\n    Args:\n    original_price (float): The original price of the product.\n    discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the discount amount and the selling price.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage\n\n    # Calculate the selling price\n    selling_price = original_price - discount_amount\n\n    return discount_amount, selling_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount and selling price\n    discount_amount, selling_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Selling Price: ${selling_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_discount` function takes the original price and discount percentage as arguments and returns a tuple containing the discount amount and the selling price.\n*   The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage divided by 100.\n*   The selling price is calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user for the original price and discount percentage, calls the `calculate_discount` function, and prints the results.\n*   The program uses f-strings to format the output with two decimal places for the prices.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the original price and discount percentage. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the original price: 100\nEnter the discount percentage: 20\nOriginal Price: $100.00\nDiscount Percentage: 20.0%\nDiscount Amount: $20.00\nSelling Price: $80.00\n```\n\nThis indicates that the original price is $100, the discount percentage is 20%, the discount amount is $20, and the selling price is $80.",
