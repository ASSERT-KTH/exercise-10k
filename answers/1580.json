  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that catches and handles exceptions raised by another function, providing a clear and actionable guide to help you implement this functionality. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef catch_exceptions(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator function to catch and handle exceptions raised by a given function.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be decorated.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A wrapper function that catches and handles exceptions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a wrapper function that will wrap the original function\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # Try to execute the original function\n        try:\n            # Call the original function with the provided arguments\n            return func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Catch all exceptions\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Print the exception message\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n            \n            # You can also log the exception or perform any other action\n            # For example, you can raise a custom exception or return a default value\n            \n            # Return None to indicate that an exception occurred\n            return None\n    \n    # Return the wrapper function\n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n\n# Define a function that may raise an exception\n@catch_exceptions\ndef divide(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The dividend.\n        b (float): The divisor.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The quotient.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a / b\n\n# Test the function\nprint(divide(10, 2))  # Should print: 5.0\nprint(divide(10, 0))  # Should print: An error occurred: division by zero\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `catch_exceptions` function is defined as a decorator, which takes another function `func` as an argument and returns a wrapper function. This wrapper function is used to catch and handle exceptions raised by `func`.\n*   Inside the `wrapper` function, a try-except block is used to catch any exceptions that occur when calling `func`. If an exception is caught, an error message is printed, and `None` is returned to indicate that an exception occurred.\n*   To use this decorator, you can apply it to any function that may raise exceptions, such as the `divide` function in the example. When an exception occurs, the decorator will catch it and print an error message instead of crashing the program.\n*   The `@catch_exceptions` syntax before the `divide` function definition is a Python decorator that applies the `catch_exceptions` decorator to the `divide` function. This allows the `divide` function to be executed within the try-except block defined in the `catch_exceptions` decorator.",
