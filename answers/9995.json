  "prompt": "Understand the concept of dynamic typing and use it correctly",
  "answer": "Dynamic Typing\n===============\n\n### Introduction\n\nDynamic typing is a feature of programming languages where the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. This means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n*   **No explicit type declaration**: Variables do not require an explicit type declaration before use.\n*   **Type determined at runtime**: The type of a variable is determined when the code is executed, not when it is compiled.\n*   **Type can change**: The type of a variable can change during the execution of the code.\n\n### Advantages\n\n*   **Flexibility**: Dynamic typing allows for more flexibility in coding, as you don't need to worry about the type of a variable before using it.\n*   **Easier code reuse**: Dynamic typing makes it easier to reuse code, as you don't need to modify the type of a variable when reusing it in a different context.\n*   **Faster development**: Dynamic typing can speed up development, as you don't need to spend time declaring the type of every variable.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n*   **Error detection**: Dynamic typing can make it harder to detect type-related errors, as they may only be detected at runtime.\n*   **Performance**: Dynamic typing can result in slower performance, as the type of a variable needs to be determined at runtime.\n*   **Code readability**: Dynamic typing can make code harder to read, as the type of a variable may not be immediately clear.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Python**: Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.\n*   **JavaScript**: JavaScript is also dynamically-typed, which makes it easy to write code without worrying about the type of a variable.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n*   **Use type hints**: Many dynamically-typed languages, such as Python, support type hints, which can help make your code more readable and self-documenting.\n*   **Use a linter**: A linter can help detect type-related errors and improve code quality.\n*   **Write unit tests**: Unit tests can help ensure that your code works correctly, even in the absence of explicit type declarations.\n\n### Code Example (Python)\n\n```python\n# Dynamic typing in Python\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# Using the function with a string\ngreet(\"John\")  # Output: Hello, John!\n\n# Using the function with an integer\ngreet(123)  # Output: Hello, 123!\n```\n\nIn this example, the `greet` function can take either a string or an integer as an argument, without the need for explicit type declarations. This demonstrates the flexibility of dynamic typing in Python.",
