The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a dictionary `student_grades` as input, where keys are student names and values are dictionaries containing their grades in different subjects.\n2. It initializes variables to store the overall sum of grades, the count of grades, the highest average grade, and the student with the highest average grade.\n3. It iterates over each student in the input dictionary, calculates the sum of grades for the current student, and calculates the average grade for the current student.\n4. It updates the overall sum of grades, the count of grades, and the average grade for the current student in the dictionary.\n5. It checks if the current student has the highest average grade and updates the highest average grade and the student with the highest average grade accordingly.\n6. It calculates the overall average grade for the class by dividing the overall sum of grades by the count of grades.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_average_grade` function with an example dictionary `student_grades`.\n8. It prints the average grades for each student, the overall average grade for the class, and the student with the highest average grade.",
