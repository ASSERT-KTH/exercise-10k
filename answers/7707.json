  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter**\n================================\n\nThis code snippet counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `count_character_frequency` function initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the frequency of each character.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the `frequency_dict`, it increments the frequency by 1. Otherwise, it adds the character to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. The function returns the `frequency_dict` containing the frequency of each character.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a string.\n6. The `count_character_frequency` function is called with the input string, and the resulting frequency dictionary is printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nEnter a string: Hello World\nCharacter Frequency:\nH: 1\ne: 1\nl: 3\no: 2\n : 1\nW: 1\nr: 1\nd: 1\n\nNote: This code is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want to ignore case, spaces, or punctuation, you can modify the code accordingly.",
