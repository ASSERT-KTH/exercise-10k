  "answer": "**Baseball Game Simulator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program simulates a game of Baseball where the user can pitch and swing until they choose to quit. The game keeps track of the number of strikes, balls, and outs.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef pitch():\n    \"\"\"Simulate a pitch\"\"\"\n    pitch_type = random.choice([\"Strike\", \"Ball\", \"Foul Ball\"])\n    return pitch_type\n\ndef swing():\n    \"\"\"Simulate a swing\"\"\"\n    swing_result = random.choice([\"Hit\", \"Miss\", \"Foul Ball\"])\n    return swing_result\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"Simulate a game of Baseball\"\"\"\n    strikes = 0\n    balls = 0\n    outs = 0\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1.

Choose to pitch or swing by entering the corresponding number.\n3. The program will simulate the pitch or swing and display the result.\n4. Continue pitching and swinging until you choose to quit or three outs are reached.\n5. The program will keep track of the number of strikes, balls, and outs throughout the game.",
