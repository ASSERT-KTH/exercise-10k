  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a password until they enter a valid one.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a password based on the following rules:\n    - The password should be at least 8 characters long.\n    - The password should have at least one uppercase letter.\n    - The password should have at least one lowercase letter.\n    - The password should have at least one digit.\n    - The password should have at least one special character.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False, \"Password should be at least 8 characters long.\"\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\n        return False, \"Password should have at least one uppercase letter.\"\n    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):\n        return False, \"Password should have at least one lowercase letter.\"\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n        return False, \"Password should have at least one digit.\"\n    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):\n        return False, \"Password should have at least one special character.\"\n    return True, \"Password is valid.\"\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n        is_valid, message = validate_password(password)\n        print(message)\n        if is_valid:\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `validate_password` function checks if the password meets the required criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character).\n*   The `main` function uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for a password until a valid one is entered.\n*   Once a valid password is entered, the loop breaks, and the program ends.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Run the program, and enter an invalid password (e.g., \"password123\"). The program will display an error message indicating what's wrong with the password.\n*   Run the program, and enter a valid password (e.g., \"Password123!\"). The program will display a success message and exit the loop.\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple yet effective way to validate user passwords using a `while` loop in Python. You can modify the `validate_password` function to add or remove validation rules as needed.",
