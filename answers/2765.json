  "answer": "**Story Filler Program**\n================================\n\nThis program takes a story with missing words as input and asks the user to fill in the missing words.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Gets user input for a specific prompt.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(prompt)\n        if user_input:\n            return user_input\n        else:\n            print(\"Please enter a value.\")\n\ndef fill_in_story(story):\n    \"\"\"Fills in the missing words in a story.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Please fill in the missing words in the story:\")\n    words = story.split()\n    filled_in_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word.startswith(\"{\") and word.endswith(\"}\"):\n            word_type = word[1:-1]\n            user_input = get_user_input(f\"Enter a {word_type}: \")\n            filled_in_words.append(user_input)\n        else:\n            filled_in_words.append(word)\n    return \" \".join(filled_in_words)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    story = input(\"Enter a story with missing words (use {word_type} for missing words): \")\n    filled_in_story_text = fill_in_story(story)\n    print(\"\\nFilled-in story:\")\n    print(filled_in_story_text)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a story with missing words, using `{word_type}` for missing words. For example: \"Once upon a time, there was a {adjective} {noun} who lived in a {location}.\"\n3. The program will ask you to fill in the missing words one by one.\n4. Enter a value for each missing word.\n5. The program will display the filled-in story.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* The program uses `{word_type}` to denote missing words in the story.\n* The `get_user_input` function ensures that the user enters a non-empty value for each missing word.\n* The `fill_in_story` function replaces the missing words with the user's input and returns the filled-in story.",
