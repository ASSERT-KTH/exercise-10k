  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled in kilometers.\n        fuel_consumed (float): Fuel consumed in liters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter (km/L).\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumed <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Fuel consumed must be greater than zero.\")\n\n    fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumed\n    return fuel_efficiency\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Fuel Efficiency Calculator\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled (km): \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the fuel consumed (L): \"))\n\n    try:\n        fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)\n        print(f\"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} km/L\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `fuel_consumed`.\n2. It checks if the `fuel_consumed` is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. It calculates the fuel efficiency by dividing the `distance` by the `fuel_consumed`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n5. It calls the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function and prints the result.\n6. It handles any errors that may occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle that traveled 250 km and consumed 20 L of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 250`, `fuel_consumed = 20`\n\t+ Output: `Fuel efficiency: 12.50 km/L`\n* Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle that traveled 500 km and consumed 30 L of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 500`, `fuel_consumed = 30`\n\t+ Output: `Fuel efficiency: 16.67 km/L`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `fuel_efficiency.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python fuel_efficiency.py`). Follow the prompts to input the distance traveled and fuel consumed, and the program will display the calculated fuel efficiency.",
