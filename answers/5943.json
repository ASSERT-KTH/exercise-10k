  "prompt": "Create a program that asks for the user's name and age, and then prints out a personalized greeting with their name and a message based on their age group (e.g., 'child', 'teen', 'adult').",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specification:\n```\n# Import the datetime module\nimport datetime\n\n# Ask for the user's name and age\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n\n# Define age groups and corresponding messages\nif age < 13:\n    age_group = \"child\"\nelif 13 <= age < 20:\n    age_group = \"teen\"\nelse:\n    age_group = \"adult\"\n\n# Print a greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are a {age_group}.\")\n```\nI've followed the specification exactly, using the `input()` function to get the user's name and age, defining the age groups and corresponding messages using `if-elif-else` statements, and printing a greeting message using an f-string. Let me know if this meets your requirements!",
