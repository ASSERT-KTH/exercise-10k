  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(numbers):\n        total += numbers[i]\n        i += 1\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input. We then use a while loop to iterate over the list, adding each number to a running total. Finally, we return the total divided by the length of the list, which gives us the average.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError. You might want to add a check for this case, depending on your requirements.\n\nHere's an updated version of the program that handles the case where the input list is empty:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers, or None if the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return None\n    total = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(numbers):\n        total += numbers[i]\n        i += 1\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nif average is not None:\n    print(\"The average is:\", average)\nelse:\n    print(\"The input list is empty.\")\n```",
