  "answer": "**Leap Year Determination**\n================================\n\nA leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.\n\n**Algorithm**\n-------------\n\n1. Check if the year is a century year (i.e., the year is divisible by 100).\n2. If the year is a century year, check if it is divisible by 400. If it is, then it is a leap year.\n3. If the year is not a century year, check if it is divisible by 4. If it is, then it is a leap year.\n\n**Example Code (Python)**\n-------------------------\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n# Example usage\nyear = 2020\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe code defines a function `is_leap_year` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility.\n\nThe logic is as follows:\n\n* `year % 4 == 0` checks if the year is divisible by 4.\n* `year % 100 != 0` checks if the year is not a century year.\n* `year % 400 == 0` checks if the year is a century year and divisible by 400.\n\nBy combining these conditions using logical operators, the function accurately determines whether a given year is a leap year.",
