  "answer": "**Date to Day of the Week Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a date as input and determines the day of the week using the `datetime` module in Python.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef date_to_day_of_week(year, month, day):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the day of the week for the given date.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year of the date.\n        month (int): The month of the date.\n        day (int): The day of the date.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The day of the week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    date = datetime.date(year, month, day)\n    return date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month: \"))\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day: \"))\n\n    # Get the day of the week\n    day_of_week = date_to_day_of_week(year, month, day)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The day of the week for {year}-{month}-{day} is {day_of_week}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the year, month, and day when prompted.\n3. The program will print the day of the week for the given date.\n\nExample:\n```\nEnter the year: 2022\nEnter the month: 12\nEnter the day: 25\nThe day of the week for 2022-12-25 is Sunday.\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses the `datetime` module, which is part of the Python standard library. The `strftime` method is used to format the date as a string, with the `%A` format code returning the full weekday name.",
