  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   If `n` is less than 0, it raises a `ValueError` since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1, as these are the base cases for the factorial.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, it recursively calls `factorial(n-1)` and multiplies the result by `n`.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the factorial of a number.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This function uses recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow for large values of `n`. For large values, an iterative approach is recommended.\n*   The function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you will need to modify the function accordingly.",
