  "answer": "**Set Union Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two sets as input and prints their union.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef set_union(set1, set2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two sets.\n\n    Args:\n        set1 (set): The first set.\n        set2 (set): The second set.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: The union of set1 and set2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set1.union(set2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n\n    union = set_union(set1, set2)\n    print(\"Union:\", union)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `set_union` function takes two sets as input and returns their union using the built-in `union` method.\n2. In the `main` function, we define two example sets and print them.\n3. We then call the `set_union` function with the two sets and print the result.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nSet 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses Python's built-in `set` data type and its `union` method to find the union of two sets.\n* The `union` method returns a new set containing all elements from both sets, without duplicates.\n* This program assumes that the input sets are valid Python sets. If the input sets are not valid, the program may raise an error.",
