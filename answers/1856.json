  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing pairs of corresponding elements from the two input lists.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef pair_elements(list1, list2):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        result.append((list1[i], list2[i]))\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    result = pair_elements(list1, list2)\n    for i in range(len(result)):\n        print(f\"Pair {i+1}: {result[i]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `pair_elements` function, which takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing pairs of corresponding elements. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `pair_elements` by creating two lists, calling the function, and printing the resulting pairs.\n\nNote that I've used the same syntax and structure as the specification, including the use of `range` and indexing to iterate over the lists, and the use of a `for` loop to print the resulting pairs. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
