  "answer": "**Comparing Two Arrays of Integers**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python program that compares two arrays of integers and determines if they are equal.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef compare_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compare two arrays of integers and determine if they are equal.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array of integers.\n        arr2 (list): The second array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the arrays are equal, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the lengths of the arrays are equal\n    if len(arr1) != len(arr2):\n        return False\n\n    # Compare the elements of the arrays\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        if arr1[i] != arr2[i]:\n            return False\n\n    # If no differences are found, the arrays are equal\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]\n\n    print(compare_arrays(arr1, arr2))  # Output: True\n    print(compare_arrays(arr1, arr3))  # Output: False\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `compare_arrays` function takes two lists of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are equal.\n2. It first checks if the lengths of the two arrays are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`.\n3. If the lengths are equal, it compares the elements of the two arrays using a for loop. If it finds any pair of elements that are not equal, it returns `False`.\n4. If it finishes comparing all elements without finding any differences, it returns `True`, indicating that the arrays are equal.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Comparing two lists of exam scores to determine if they are identical.\n* Verifying that two arrays of data are identical before performing further processing.\n* Checking if two lists of integers are equal in a unit test.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use the built-in `==` operator in Python to compare two lists directly:\n```python\ndef compare_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    return arr1 == arr2\n```\nThis is a more concise and efficient way to compare two lists, but it may not be as educational for understanding the underlying comparison logic.",
