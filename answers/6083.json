  "prompt": "Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return fib_sequence[:n]\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\nHowever, this program uses a while loop instead of a for loop. If you want to use a for loop, you can use the following program:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\nThis program initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0 and 1) and then uses a for loop to generate the remaining terms. The loop iterates from 2 to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two terms to the sequence. Finally, it returns the generated sequence.",
