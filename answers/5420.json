  "prompt": "Write a function called 'count_vowels' that counts and returns the number of vowels in a given string.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string, providing a clear and step-by-step solution to your problem. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef count_vowels(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels present in it.\n\n    Parameters:\n    input_string (str): The string to be checked for vowels.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of vowels in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a counter variable to store the count of vowels\n    vowel_count = 0\n    \n    # Define all the vowels in a string\n    # We are considering both lowercase and uppercase vowels\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is a vowel\n        if char in vowels:\n            # If the character is a vowel, increment the vowel count\n            vowel_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of vowels\n    return vowel_count\n\n# Test the function\nprint(count_vowels(\"Hello World\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `count_vowels` is defined with a parameter `input_string` to accept the string to be checked for vowels. It also includes a docstring that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n* A counter variable `vowel_count` is initialized to store the count of vowels, and a string `vowels` is defined to include all lowercase and uppercase vowels.\n* The function iterates over each character `char` in the `input_string` using a for loop, checking if `char` is present in the `vowels` string. If it is, the `vowel_count` is incremented by 1.\n* Finally, the function returns the total `vowel_count`, providing the number of vowels in the input string.",
