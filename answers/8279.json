  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the LCM of two numbers:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(num1*num2) // math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input, `num1` and `num2`.\n2. It uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num1` and `num2`.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: `lcm = (num1 * num2) / gcd`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates the LCM using the `calculate_lcm` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n* Enter the first number: 12\n* Enter the second number: 15\n* The LCM of 12 and 15 is 60.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can calculate the GCD using a different method, such as the Euclidean algorithm.",
