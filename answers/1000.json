The function uses the `statistics` module to calculate these measures.\n\n*   The function first checks if the input is a list, if the list is empty, and if all elements in the list are numbers. If any of these checks fail, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   It then calculates the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation using the `statistics` module. If there is no unique mode, it catches the `StatisticsError` and sets the mode to \"No unique mode found\". If the list contains only one element, it sets the standard deviation to \"Standard deviation is not defined for a single data point\".\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_statistics` function with an example list of numbers.\n*   The program prints the calculated statistical measures to the console.\n\n### Advice\nTo use this program, simply replace the `numbers` list in the `main` function with your own list of numbers. The program will calculate and print the statistical measures for your list.\n\nRemember to handle any potential errors that may occur during the calculation of statistical measures, such as an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values.",
