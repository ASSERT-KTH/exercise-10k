  "answer": "**Sphere Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius using the formula: `V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3`, where `V` is the volume and `r` is the radius.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sphere_volume(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)\n        print(f\"The volume of the sphere with radius {radius} is: {volume:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_sphere_volume` function takes the radius as input and returns the calculated volume.\n2. The formula `V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3` is used to calculate the volume.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates example usage, prompting the user to enter the radius and printing the calculated volume.\n4. Error handling is included to ensure the radius is not negative.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `sphere_volume.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python sphere_volume.py`).\n3. Enter the radius of the sphere when prompted.\n4. The program will print the calculated volume.",
