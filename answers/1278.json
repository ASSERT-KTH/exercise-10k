  "answer": "**Merge Sort Algorithm Implementation**\n======================================\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm. This program defines a function `merge_sort` that recursively divides the input list into two halves until each sublist contains only one element, and then merges the sublists in sorted order.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list using the merge sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Find the middle of the list\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n\n    # Divide the list into two halves\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort both halves\n    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)\n\n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        left (list): The first sorted list.\n        right (list): The second sorted list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in either list, append them to the merged list\n    merged.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged.extend(right[right_index:])\n\n    return merged\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_arr)\n\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The `merge_sort` function takes a list as input and checks if it has one or zero elements. If so, it returns the list as it's already sorted.\n2.  The function finds the middle of the list and divides it into two halves: `left_half` and `right_half`.\n3.  It recursively calls `merge_sort` on both halves to sort them individually.\n4.  Once both halves are sorted, the `merge` function is called to merge them into a single sorted list.\n5.  The `merge` function compares elements from both lists and adds the smaller element to the `merged` list. This process continues until all elements from both lists are merged.\n6.  Finally, the `merge_sort` function returns the sorted list.\n\n**Time complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\n**Space complexity:** O(n), as the algorithm requires additional space to store the temporary sublists during the merge process.",
