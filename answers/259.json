  "prompt": "Write a program that takes multiple lists as input, and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are common to all lists.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code that implements the common elements finder as per your specifications:\n\n```python\n# Create lists\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nlist3 = [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# Find the intersection of the lists\ncommon_elements = set(list1) & set(list2) & set(list3)\n\n# Print the common elements\nprint(common_elements)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `set()` because there are no elements that are common to all three lists.\n\nIf you want to find the common elements between any two lists, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\n# Create lists\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nlist3 = [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# Find the intersection of list1 and list2\ncommon_elements_12 = set(list1) & set(list2)\nprint(common_elements_12)\n\n# Find the intersection of list1 and list3\ncommon_elements_13 = set(list1) & set(list3)\nprint(common_elements_13)\n\n# Find the intersection of list2 and list3\ncommon_elements_23 = set(list2) & set(list3)\nprint(common_elements_23)\n```\n\nThis code will output the common elements between each pair of lists.",
