  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])\n    return fib_sequence\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of terms from the user\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence\n    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\n\n    # Print the Fibonacci sequence\n    print(\"Fibonacci Sequence:\")\n    for i, num in enumerate(fib_sequence):\n        print(f\"F({i}) = {num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a function `generate_fibonacci(n)` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number. We initialize the sequence with the first two numbers (0 and 1) and then use a for loop to generate the rest of the sequence. In each iteration of the loop, we append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the sequence.\n\nIn the `main()` function, we prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want in the sequence, generate the sequence using the `generate_fibonacci(n)` function, and then print the sequence.\n\nTo run the program, simply copy and paste it into a Python file (e.g., `fibonacci.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python fibonacci.py`). When prompted, enter the number of terms you want in the sequence, and the program will print the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.",
