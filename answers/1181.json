  "answer": "**Voting Eligibility Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their age and determines whether they are eligible to vote or not. In most countries, the voting age is 18.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the user is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The user's age.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the user is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    voting_age = 18\n    return age >= voting_age\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for their age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    # Check if the user is eligible to vote\n    if check_voting_eligibility(age):\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters an age of 25, the program will print \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* If the user enters an age of 17, the program will print \"You are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\"\n\n### How to Run\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `voting_eligibility.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python voting_eligibility.py` and pressing Enter.\n4.
