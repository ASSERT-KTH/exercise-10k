  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an input string and determines the data type of the value represented by the string. The data types to consider are integers, floats, and strings. If the string represents an integer, output 'int'. If it represents a float, output 'float'. If it represents neither an integer nor a float, output 'string'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that corresponds to the detailed specification you provided:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Description: This program determines the data type of a value represented by an input string.\n\ndef check_type(s):\n    try:\n        int(s)\n        return 'int'\n    except ValueError:\n        try:\n            float(s)\n            return 'float'\n        except ValueError:\n            return 'string'\n\ndef main():\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    print(check_type(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date comments blank, as you'll want to fill those in with your own information. Also, I've used `input()` to get the input string from the user, but if you want to use a hardcoded string instead, you can simply replace the `input()` call with the string itself, like this: `s = \"123.45\"`.",
