  "answer": "### Caesar Cipher Function\n#### Description\nThe Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each character in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. This function implements the Caesar cipher encryption.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher_encrypt(text: str, shift: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Encrypts the input text using the Caesar cipher with the given shift.\n\n    Args:\n    text (str): The input text to be encrypted.\n    shift (int): The number of positions to shift the alphabet.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The encrypted text.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for char in text:\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character, and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + shift) % 26 + ord('A'))\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character, and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))\n        # If the character is not a letter, leave it unchanged\n        else:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = \"Hello, World!\"\n    shift = 3\n    encrypted_text = caesar_cipher_encrypt(text, shift)\n    print(f\"Text: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Shift: {shift}\")\n    print(f\"Encrypted Text: {encrypted_text}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `caesar_cipher_encrypt` takes two parameters: `text` (the input string) and `shift` (the number of positions to shift the alphabet).\n2. It iterates over each character in the input text.\n3. If the character is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase), it calculates the new character by shifting the current character's position in the alphabet by the specified amount.\n4. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., 'z' shifted by 1 becomes 'a').\n5. If the character is not a letter, it leaves the character unchanged.\n6. The encrypted characters are appended to the `result` string, which is returned at the end of the function.",
