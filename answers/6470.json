  "answer": "### Copying a Dictionary in Python\n#### Function Description\nThe following function creates a deep copy of a given dictionary. This means it will recursively copy all nested dictionaries, lists, and other mutable objects.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef copy_dictionary(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a deep copy of a given dictionary.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be copied.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A deep copy of the input dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return copy.deepcopy(input_dict)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    original_dict = {\n        \"key1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key2\": [1, 2, 3],\n        \"key3\": {\"nested_key1\": \"nested_value1\"}\n    }\n    \n    copied_dict = copy_dictionary(original_dict)\n    \n    # Modify the original dictionary to verify the copy\n    original_dict[\"key1\"] = \"new_value1\"\n    original_dict[\"key2\"].append(4)\n    original_dict[\"key3\"][\"nested_key1\"] = \"new_nested_value1\"\n    \n    print(\"Original Dictionary:\")\n    print(original_dict)\n    print(\"\\nCopied Dictionary:\")\n    print(copied_dict)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n- The `copy` module in Python provides functions to create copies of objects.\n- `copy.deepcopy()` is used to create a deep copy, which is necessary for dictionaries that contain mutable objects like lists or other dictionaries.\n- In the example usage, we first define a dictionary `original_dict` with various types of values, including a list and a nested dictionary.\n- We then create a copy of this dictionary using our `copy_dictionary` function.\n- To verify that the copy is indeed a separate object, we modify the original dictionary in several ways and print both the original and copied dictionaries.\n- The output will show that the modifications made to the original dictionary did not affect the copied dictionary, confirming that a deep copy was successfully created.",
