  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and an element as input and appends the element to the end of the list",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef append_to_list(input_list, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Appends an element to the end of a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to which the element is to be appended.\n        element: The element to be appended.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The list with the element appended.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_list.append(element)\n    return input_list\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nelement = 6\nprint(append_to_list(input_list, element))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `append_to_list` that takes two arguments: `input_list` (the list to which we want to append an element) and `element` (the element to be appended).\n2.  Inside the function, we use the built-in `append` method of Python lists to add the `element` to the end of `input_list`.\n3.  The function then returns the modified list.\n4.  We provide an example usage of the function, where we append the number `6` to the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The output is the modified list with `6` appended to the end.\n\nNote that the `append` method modifies the list in place, meaning that it changes the original list. If you want to preserve the original list and return a new list with the element appended, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate the list with a list containing the element, like this: `return input_list + [element]`.",
