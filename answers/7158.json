  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a new dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of student names who received that grade.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that organizes students by their grades. This function will take a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input and return a new dictionary with grades as keys and lists of student names as values. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef group_students_by_grade(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input.\n    It returns a new dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of student names who received that grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with grades as keys and lists of student names as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the result\n    result = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():\n        # Check if the grade is already a key in the result dictionary\n        if grade not in result:\n            # If not, add it as a key with an empty list as its value\n            result[grade] = []\n        \n        # Append the student's name to the list of students with the same grade\n        result[grade].append(student)\n\n    # Return the resulting dictionary\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"Alice\": 90,\n    \"Bob\": 85,\n    \"Charlie\": 90,\n    \"David\": 80,\n    \"Eve\": 85\n}\n\nprint(group_students_by_grade(grades))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `group_students_by_grade` initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the grades and corresponding student names.\n* It then iterates over each student and their grade in the input dictionary `grades_dict`, checking if the grade is already a key in the `result` dictionary. If not, it adds the grade as a key with an empty list as its value.\n* The function appends each student's name to the list of students with the same grade in the `result` dictionary.\n* Finally, it returns the resulting dictionary, which contains the grades as keys and lists of student names as values.",
