  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program to simulate a quiz show:\n\n```python\n# Quiz Show Simulator\n\n# Dictionary of questions, answers, and prizes\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\"A\": \"Paris\", \"B\": \"London\", \"C\": \"Berlin\", \"D\": \"Rome\", \"Answer\": \"A\", \"Prize\": 100},\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"B\": \"Michelangelo\", \"C\": \"Raphael\", \"D\": \"Caravaggio\", \"Answer\": \"A\", \"Prize\": 200},\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\"A\": \"Earth\", \"B\": \"Saturn\", \"C\": \"Jupiter\", \"D\": \"Uranus\", \"Answer\": \"C\", \"Prize\": 300},\n    \"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?\": {\"A\": \"William Shakespeare\", \"B\": \"Jane Austen\", \"C\": \"Charles Dickens\", \"D\": \"J.K. Rowling\", \"Answer\": \"A\", \"Prize\": 400},\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\"A\": \"Ag\", \"B\": \"Au\", \"C\": \"Hg\", \"D\": \"Pb\", \"Answer\": \"B\", \"Prize\": 500},\n}\n\ndef quiz_show():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Quiz Show!\")\n    print(\"You will be asked a series of questions, and for each question you answer correctly, you will win a prize.\")\n    print(\"If you answer a question incorrectly, the game will end.\")\n    \n    total_prize = 0\n    for question, options in quiz_questions.items():\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion: {question}\")\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"Answer\" and option != \"Prize\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        \n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"Answer\"]:\n            print(f\"Correct! You won ${options['Prize']}.\")\n            total_prize += options[\"Prize\"]\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {options['Answer']}. Game over.\")\n            break\n    \n    print(f\"\\nYou won a total of ${total_prize}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz_show()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Read each question carefully and choose an answer from the options provided.\n3. Enter your answer (A, B, C, or D).\n4. If your answer is correct, you will win the prize for that question and move on to the next question.\n5. If your answer is incorrect, the game will end and your total prize will be displayed.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nWelcome to the Quiz Show!\nYou will be asked a series of questions, and for each question you answer correctly, you will win a prize.\nIf you answer a question incorrectly, the game will end.\n\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nB: London\nC: Berlin\nD: Rome\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): A\nCorrect! You won $100.\n\nQuestion: Who painted the Mona Lisa?\nA: Leonardo da Vinci\nB: Michelangelo\nC: Raphael\nD: Caravaggio\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): A\nCorrect! You won $200.\n\n...\n```\n\nNote: This is a simple text-based quiz show simulator. You can modify and extend the program to add more features, such as scoring, timer, and multiple rounds.",
