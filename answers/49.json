  "answer": "**Validating an IP Address**\n\nTo validate an IP address, you can check if it matches the standard IP address format. Here are the rules:\n\n### IPv4\n\n*   Consists of four numbers separated by dots (`.`)\n*   Each number is between 0 and 255 (inclusive)\n*   Each number does not have leading zeros (unless the number is 0)\n\n### IPv6\n\n*   Consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (`:`)\n*   Each group can be zero-suppressed (e.g., `0001` can be written as `1`)\n*   Consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced with `::` (but only once)\n\nHere's a Python function to validate an IP address:\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef validate_ip(address):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an IP address.\n\n    Args:\n        address (str): The IP address to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the IP address is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        ipaddress.ip_address(address)\n        return True\n    except ValueError:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(validate_ip(\"192.168.1.1\"))  # True\nprint(validate_ip(\"256.1.1.1\"))  # False\nprint(validate_ip(\"2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\"))  # True\nprint(validate_ip(\"2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:733g\"))  # False\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We use the `ipaddress` module in Python, which provides classes for manipulating IP addresses.\n*   The `validate_ip` function takes an IP address as input and tries to create an `ip_address` object from it.\n*   If the IP address is valid, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `False`.\n\nThis code supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and follows the standard IP address format rules.",
