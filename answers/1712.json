  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a To-Do list app using a while loop:\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty list to store tasks\ntasks = []\n\n# Initialize a variable to store user's choice\nchoice = \"\"\n\n# Loop until user chooses to quit\nwhile choice.lower() != \"quit\":\n    # Print the menu\n    print(\"\\nTo-Do List App\")\n    print(\"1. Add Task\")\n    print(\"2. View Tasks\")\n    print(\"3. Quit\")\n\n    # Ask user for their choice\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, or 'quit'): \")\n\n    # Handle user's choice\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        # Ask user for task description\n        task = input(\"Enter task description: \")\n        # Add task to the list\n        tasks.append(task)\n        print(f\"Task '{task}' added successfully!\")\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        # Check if tasks list is empty\n        if not tasks:\n            print(\"No tasks in the list.\")\n        else:\n            # Print tasks\n            print(\"\\nYour Tasks:\")\n            for i, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):\n                print(f\"{i}. {task}\")\n    elif choice.lower() == \"quit\":\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n# End of program\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Run the program and choose option 1 to add tasks.\n*   Choose option 2 to view the tasks you've added.\n*   Type 'quit' to exit the program.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1.  We start by initializing an empty list `tasks` to store user-added tasks.\n2.  The program enters a while loop, which continues until the user types 'quit'.\n3.  Inside the loop, we print a menu with options to add tasks, view tasks, or quit the program.\n4.  We ask the user for their choice and handle it accordingly:\n    *   If the user chooses to add a task (option 1), we prompt them to enter a task description, add it to the `tasks` list, and display a success message.\n    *   If the user chooses to view tasks (option 2), we check if the `tasks` list is empty. If it is, we display a message indicating that there are no tasks. Otherwise, we print the tasks with their corresponding numbers.\n    *   If the user chooses to quit (option 3 or types 'quit'), we display a goodbye message and exit the loop, ending the program.\n    *   If the user enters an invalid choice, we display an error message and prompt them to try again.",
