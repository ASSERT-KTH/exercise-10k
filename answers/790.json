  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial principal amount.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal).\n        years (int): The number of years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final amount after compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    final_amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** years\n    return final_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The final amount after {years} years is: ${final_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The compound interest earned is: ${final_amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $1,000, an interest rate of 5%, and 10 years.\n* Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $5,000, an interest rate of 3%, and 5 years.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `compound_interest.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python compound_interest.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n5. The program will calculate and display the final amount and compound interest earned.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the interest rate is constant over the given period.\n* The interest rate is expected to be entered as a percentage value (e.g., 5 for 5%).\n* The program uses the formula for compound interest: `A = P * (1 + r) ^ n`, where `A` is the final amount, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `n` is the number of years.",
