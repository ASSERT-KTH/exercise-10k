  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"\\nOperations:\")\n    print(\"1.

Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `arithmetic_operations.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python arithmetic_operations.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and select an operation.\n5. The program will display the result of the selected operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and select `1` for addition. The program will display `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n* Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and select `2` for subtraction. The program will display `10 - 5 = 5.0`.\n* Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and select `3` for multiplication. The program will display `10 * 5 = 50.0`.\n* Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and select `4` for division. The program will display `10 / 5 = 2.0`.",
