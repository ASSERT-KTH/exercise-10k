  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that checks the data type of a variable and performs different actions based on its type.\n\n```python\ndef check_data_type(var):\n    \"\"\"\n    Dynamically checks the data type of a variable and performs actions based on its type.\n\n    Args:\n        var: The variable to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the variable is an integer\n    if isinstance(var, int):\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is an integer.\")\n        print(\"Performing integer-specific action...\")\n        print(f\"The square of {var} is {var ** 2}\")\n\n    # Check if the variable is a float\n    elif isinstance(var, float):\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is a float.\")\n        print(\"Performing float-specific action...\")\n        print(f\"The square root of {var} is {var ** 0.5}\")\n\n    # Check if the variable is a string\n    elif isinstance(var, str):\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is a string.\")\n        print(\"Performing string-specific action...\")\n        print(f\"The length of the string {var} is {len(var)}\")\n\n    # Check if the variable is a list\n    elif isinstance(var, list):\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is a list.\")\n        print(\"Performing list-specific action...\")\n        print(f\"The length of the list {var} is {len(var)}\")\n\n    # Check if the variable is a dictionary\n    elif isinstance(var, dict):\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is a dictionary.\")\n        print(\"Performing dictionary-specific action...\")\n        print(f\"The keys of the dictionary {var} are {list(var.keys())}\")\n\n    # If the variable is of any other type, print a message\n    else:\n        print(f\"The variable {var} is of type {type(var)}\")\n        print(\"No specific action defined for this type.\")\n\n# Test the function with different types of variables\ncheck_data_type(10)  # Integer\ncheck_data_type(10.5)  # Float\ncheck_data_type(\"Hello\")  # String\ncheck_data_type([1, 2, 3])  # List\ncheck_data_type({\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2})  # Dictionary\ncheck_data_type((1, 2, 3))  # Tuple\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `check_data_type` that takes a variable as an argument. It uses the `isinstance` function to check the type of the variable and performs different actions based on its type. The function supports integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries, and prints a message for variables of other types. The program then tests the function with variables of different types.",
