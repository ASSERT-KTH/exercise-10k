  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses a sliding window approach along with a set to track the unique characters in the current substring:\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_set = set()\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_substring(\"abcabcbb\"))  # Output: \"abc\"\nprint(longest_substring(\"bbbbb\"))  # Output: \"b\"\nprint(longest_substring(\"pwwkew\"))  # Output: \"wke\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string. We also initialize a set `char_set` to store the unique characters in the current substring.\n2. We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer. For each character, we check if it's already in the `char_set`. If it is, we remove the character at the `left` pointer from the set and increment the `left` pointer until the repeating character is removed from the set.\n3. We add the character at the `right` pointer to the `char_set`.\n4. We update the `max_length` and `max_substring` variables if the current substring (from `left` to `right`) is longer than the previous maximum.\n5. Finally, we return the `max_substring` variable, which stores the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set. In the worst case, the set will store all unique characters in the string.",
