  "answer": "**Input Redirection Program**\n================================\n\nThis program will take input from a source file and redirect it to a destination file. It will also handle any errors that may occur during the process.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef redirect_input(src, dst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Redirects input from src to dst.\n\n    Args:\n        src (str): The source file path.\n        dst (str): The destination file path.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Open the source file in read mode\n        with open(src, 'r') as f_in:\n            # Read the contents of the source file\n            data = f_in.read()\n        \n        # Open the destination file in write mode\n        with open(dst, 'w') as f_out:\n            # Write the contents of the source file to the destination file\n            f_out.write(data)\n        \n        print(f\"Input successfully redirected from {src} to {dst}\")\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Source file {src} not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if the correct number of arguments are provided\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python input_redirect.py <source_file> <destination_file>\")\n        return\n    \n    # Get the source and destination file paths from the command line arguments\n    src = sys.argv[1]\n    dst = sys.argv[2]\n    \n    # Call the redirect_input function\n    redirect_input(src, dst)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The program uses the `sys` module to access command line arguments.\n2. The `redirect_input` function takes two arguments: `src` (the source file path) and `dst` (the destination file path).\n3. It attempts to open the source file in read mode and reads its contents.\n4. It then attempts to open the destination file in write mode and writes the contents of the source file to it.\n5. If any errors occur during this process (e.g., the source file is not found), it catches the exception and prints an error message.\n6. The `main` function checks if the correct number of command line arguments are provided and calls the `redirect_input` function with the provided source and destination file paths.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo use this program, save it to a file named `input_redirect.py` and run it from the command line like this:\n```bash\npython input_redirect.py source.txt destination.txt\n```\nThis will redirect the input from `source.txt` to `destination.txt`. Make sure to replace `source.txt` and `destination.txt` with the actual file paths you want to use.",
