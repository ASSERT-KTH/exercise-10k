  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest increasing subsequence of a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    - lis (list): The longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nums:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize lists to store lengths and subsequences\n    lengths = [1] * len(nums)\n    subsequences = [[num] for num in nums]\n\n    # Compute lengths and subsequences\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if nums[i] > nums[j] and lengths[i] < lengths[j] + 1:\n                lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1\n                subsequences[i] = subsequences[j] + [nums[i]]\n\n    # Find the longest subsequence\n    max_length = max(lengths)\n    longest_subsequence = [sub for sub in subsequences if len(sub) == max_length]\n\n    return longest_subsequence[0]\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\nprint(\"Original list:\", nums)\nprint(\"Longest increasing subsequence:\", longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Initialize lists `lengths` and `subsequences` to store the lengths and subsequences of increasing sequences ending at each position.\n2.  **Dynamic Programming**: Iterate through the list, updating `lengths` and `subsequences` based on whether the current number can extend an existing increasing subsequence.\n3.  **Find Longest Subsequence**: Identify the maximum length and the corresponding subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the lengths and subsequences for each position in the input list.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor the input list `[10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]`, the program outputs:\n\n```\nOriginal list: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\nLongest increasing subsequence: [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80]\n```",
