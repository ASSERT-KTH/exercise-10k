  "answer": "### Variable Scopes in Python\nIn Python, variables can have different scopes depending on where they are defined. The scope of a variable determines its accessibility and lifetime.\n\n### Types of Variable Scopes in Python\n\n1. **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside any function or class have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n2. **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function or method have local scope. They can only be accessed within that function or method.\n3. **Enclosing Scope**: Variables defined inside a nested function have enclosing scope. They can be accessed within the outer function and the inner function.\n4. **Built-in Scope**: Variables and functions defined in the Python standard library have built-in scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n\n### Example Code\n\n```python\n# Global scope\nglobal_variable = \"I am a global variable\"\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing scope\n    enclosing_variable = \"I am an enclosing variable\"\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local scope\n        local_variable = \"I am a local variable\"\n\n        # Accessing variables from different scopes\n        print(\"Accessing global variable:\", global_variable)\n        print(\"Accessing enclosing variable:\", enclosing_variable)\n        print(\"Accessing local variable:\", local_variable)\n\n    inner_function()\n\n# Accessing global variable from global scope\nprint(\"Accessing global variable from global scope:\", global_variable)\n\n# Trying to access enclosing variable from global scope will raise an error\ntry:\n    print(enclosing_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Error: Enclosing variable is not accessible from global scope\")\n\n# Calling the outer function\nouter_function()\n```\n\n### Output\n```\nAccessing global variable from global scope: I am a global variable\nError: Enclosing variable is not accessible from global scope\nAccessing global variable: I am a global variable\nAccessing enclosing variable: I am an enclosing variable\nAccessing local variable: I am a local variable\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `global_variable` is defined in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n*   The `enclosing_variable` is defined in the enclosing scope and can only be accessed within the `outer_function` and the `inner_function`.\n*   The `local_variable` is defined in the local scope and can only be accessed within the `inner_function`.\n*   Trying to access the `enclosing_variable` from the global scope raises a `NameError` because it is not defined in the global scope.",
