  "prompt": "Create a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. The program should ask for user input, and then print out whether the number is even or odd.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is even or odd.\"\"\"\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        return \"even\"\n    else:\n        return \"odd\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask for user input\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number. Please try again.\")\n\n    # Check if the number is even or odd\n    result = check_even_odd(num)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The number {num} is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **User Input**: The program asks the user to enter a number. It uses a `while` loop to keep asking until a valid integer is entered.\n2. **Checking Even/Odd**: The `check_even_odd` function takes an integer as input and returns a string indicating whether it's even or odd. It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the number when divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.\n3. **Printing Result**: The `main` function calls `check_even_odd` with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print: `The number 10 is even.`\n* If the user enters `11`, the program will print: `The number 11 is odd.`\n\nYou can run this program, enter a number when prompted, and it will tell you whether the number is even or odd.",
