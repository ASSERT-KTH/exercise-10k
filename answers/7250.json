  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the given operation on the two numbers. The program should then output the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef main():\n    print(\"Arithmetic Operations Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    x = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    y = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    z = input(\"Enter the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    if z == \"+\":\n        print(\"Result:\", x + y)\n    elif z == \"-\":\n        print(\"Result:\", x - y)\n    elif z == \"*\":\n        print(\"Result:\", x * y)\n    elif z == \"/\":\n        if y == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Result:\", x / y)\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI hope this meets the requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any modifications.",
