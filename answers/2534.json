The `longest_common_subsequence` function takes two input strings, `str1` and `str2`, and returns their longest common subsequence.\n2.  It initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n3.  The function fills the `dp` table by iterating over the characters of `str1` and `str2`. If the current characters match, it increments the diagonal value in the table. Otherwise, it takes the maximum value from the top or left cell.\n4.  After building the `dp` table, the function reconstructs the LCS by tracing back the table from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n5.  Finally, it returns the LCS as a string by joining the characters in the `lcs` list in reverse order.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(m \\* n), which is the size of the dynamic programming table.",
