  "prompt": "Create a program that classifies a student's grade based on their score. The program should take an integer score between 0 and 100 as input and output the corresponding grade. The grading scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60). Use conditional statements to implement this logic.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\ndef grade(score):\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:\n        return 'D'\n    elif score >= 0 and score <= 59:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    score = int(input(\"Enter your score (0-100): \"))\n    grade_letter = grade(score)\n    print(f\"Your grade is: {grade_letter}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `grade` function, which takes an integer score as input and returns the corresponding grade letter based on the conditions specified. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their score, calls the `grade` function with the user's score, and prints the result. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.",
