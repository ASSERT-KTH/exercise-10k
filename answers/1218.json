  "answer": "**Perfect Square Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [16, 20, 25, 30, 36]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is a perfect square: {is_perfect_square(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_perfect_square(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is negative, it immediately returns `False`, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares.\n3. It calculates the square root of `n` using `math.sqrt(n)`.\n4. It checks if the square root is equal to its integer value (i.e., `sqrt == int(sqrt)`). If this condition is true, then `n` is a perfect square.\n5. The function returns `True` if `n` is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* `is_perfect_square(16)` returns `True` because 16 is a perfect square (4^2).\n* `is_perfect_square(20)` returns `False` because 20 is not a perfect square.\n* `is_perfect_square(25)` returns `True` because 25 is a perfect square (5^2).",
