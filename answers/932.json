  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that creates a student information system using if/else statements:\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, grade):\n        self.name = name\n        self.roll_number = roll_number\n        self.grade = grade\n\ndef add_student():\n    name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n    roll_number = input(\"Enter student roll number: \")\n    grade = input(\"Enter student grade: \")\n    student = Student(name, roll_number, grade)\n    return student\n\ndef display_student(student):\n    print(f\"Name: {student.name}\")\n    print(f\"Roll Number: {student.roll_number}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {student.grade}\")\n\ndef search_student():\n    roll_number = input(\"Enter roll number to search: \")\n    # Assuming we have a list of students\n    students = [\n        Student(\"John Doe\", \"R123\", \"A\"),\n        Student(\"Jane Doe\", \"R456\", \"B\"),\n        Student(\"Bob Smith\", \"R789\", \"C\")\n    ]\n    for student in students:\n        if student.roll_number == roll_number:\n            display_student(student)\n            return\n    print(\"Student not found\")\n\ndef update_student():\n    roll_number = input(\"Enter roll number to update: \")\n    students = [\n        Student(\"John Doe\", \"R123\", \"A\"),\n        Student(\"Jane Doe\", \"R456\", \"B\"),\n        Student(\"Bob Smith\", \"R789\", \"C\")\n    ]\n    for student in students:\n        if student.roll_number == roll_number:\n            print(\"1.

The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the system.\n\nPlease note that this program uses a list of students for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would likely use a database to store student information.",
