  "prompt": "Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two integer variables.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Addition: \", add(num1, num2))\n    print(\"Subtraction: \", subtract(num1, num2))\n    print(\"Multiplication: \", multiply(num1, num2))\n\n    try:\n        print(\"Division: \", divide(num1, num2))\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(\"Error: \", e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define four functions for the basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.\n*   In the `divide` function, we check if the divisor (`num2`) is zero to prevent a division by zero error. If it is, we raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   In the `main` function, we take two integer inputs from the user, perform the arithmetic operations, and print the results.\n*   We use a try-except block to catch and handle any `ZeroDivisionError` that might occur during division.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. Let's say you enter `10` and `2`. The program will then print the results of the arithmetic operations:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 2\nAddition:  12\nSubtraction:  8\nMultiplication:  20\nDivision:  5.0\n```",
