The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n1. **Add Student**: Select option 1, enter the student's name and grade, and the student will be added to the system.\n2. **Remove Student**: Select option 2, enter the student's name, and the student will be removed from the system if they exist.\n3. **Update Student Grade**: Select option 3, enter the student's name and new grade, and the student's grade will be updated if they exist.\n4. **Display Student Records**: Select option 4 to view all student records in the system.\n5. **Quit**: Select option 5 to exit the program.\n\nNote that this program uses a simple dictionary to store student records, which means it does not persist data between sessions. For a more robust solution, consider using a database to store student records.",
