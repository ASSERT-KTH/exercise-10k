  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a dictionary with the student names as keys and their grades as values, but only include students who have a grade above 80.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters a dictionary of student grades to include only those with grades above 80. This function will take a dictionary as input and return a new dictionary with the filtered results. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_students(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters a dictionary of student grades and returns a new dictionary \n    with only the students who have a grade above 80.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with student names as keys and their grades as values, \n        but only includes students with a grade above 80.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students\n    filtered_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades.items():\n        # Check if the student's grade is above 80\n        if grade > 80:\n            # If the grade is above 80, add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_grades[student] = grade\n\n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_grades\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    'John': 85,\n    'Alice': 70,\n    'Bob': 90,\n    'Charlie': 75,\n    'David': 95\n}\n\nprint(filter_students(grades))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `filter_students` initializes an empty dictionary `filtered_grades` to store the filtered student grades.\n* It then iterates over each student in the input dictionary `grades` using a for loop, checking if the student's grade is above 80.\n* If a student's grade is above 80, they are added to the `filtered_grades` dictionary with their name as the key and grade as the value.\n* Finally, the function returns the `filtered_grades` dictionary, which contains only the students with grades above 80.",
