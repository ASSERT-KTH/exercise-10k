  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a geometric sequence of a given length with a given common ratio.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that generates a geometric sequence of a given length with a given common ratio.\n\n```python\ndef geometric_sequence(length, ratio, start=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a geometric sequence of a given length with a given common ratio.\n\n    Parameters:\n    length (int): The length of the sequence.\n    ratio (float): The common ratio of the sequence.\n    start (float): The starting value of the sequence. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The generated geometric sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [start]\n    for _ in range(length - 1):\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] * ratio)\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    length = 10  # length of the sequence\n    ratio = 2    # common ratio\n    sequence = geometric_sequence(length, ratio)\n    print(f\"Geometric sequence with length {length} and common ratio {ratio}:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `geometric_sequence` that generates the sequence. It starts with a single-element list containing the start value (which defaults to 1). Then it enters a loop to generate the rest of the sequence. In each iteration of the loop, it appends a new element to the sequence by multiplying the last element by the common ratio. The generated sequence is then returned.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `geometric_sequence` function. It generates a geometric sequence of length 10 with a common ratio of 2 and prints the result. You can adjust the `length` and `ratio` variables to generate different sequences.",
