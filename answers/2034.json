  "answer": "**Credit Score Program**\n========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program determines a person's credit score based on their credit history and income. It uses if/else statements to evaluate the input data and assign a credit score.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_credit_score(credit_history, income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a person's credit score based on their credit history and income.\n\n    Args:\n        credit_history (str): 'good', 'fair', or 'poor'\n        income (int): Annual income\n\n    Returns:\n        int: Credit score (300-850)\n    \"\"\"\n    if credit_history == 'good':\n        if income >= 50000:\n            credit_score = 750\n        elif income >= 30000:\n            credit_score = 700\n        else:\n            credit_score = 650\n    elif credit_history == 'fair':\n        if income >= 50000:\n            credit_score = 650\n        elif income >= 30000:\n            credit_score = 600\n        else:\n            credit_score = 550\n    else:\n        if income >= 50000:\n            credit_score = 550\n        elif income >= 30000:\n            credit_score = 500\n        else:\n            credit_score = 450\n\n    return credit_score\n\ndef main():\n    credit_history = input(\"Enter your credit history (good, fair, or poor): \")\n    income = int(input(\"Enter your annual income: \"))\n\n    credit_score = calculate_credit_score(credit_history, income)\n    print(f\"Your credit score is: {credit_score}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_credit_score` function takes two arguments: `credit_history` and `income`.\n2. It uses if/else statements to evaluate the `credit_history` and `income` and assign a credit score.\n3. The credit score is based on the following ranges:\n\t* Good credit history: 650-750\n\t* Fair credit history: 550-650\n\t* Poor credit history: 450-550\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input their credit history and income, calls the `calculate_credit_score` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Good credit history, high income: `credit_history = 'good', income = 60000` -> Credit score: 750\n* Fair credit history, medium income: `credit_history = 'fair', income = 40000` -> Credit score: 600\n* Poor credit history, low income: `credit_history = 'poor', income = 20000` -> Credit score: 450\n\nNote: This is a simplified example and actual credit score calculations are more complex and involve multiple factors.",
