For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to the Mad Libs game!\nI will ask you for some words, and then I will create a story with them.\nEnter a name: John\nEnter an adjective: happy\nEnter another adjective: tall\nEnter one more adjective: brave\nEnter a noun: book\nEnter another noun: car\nEnter an animal: dragon\nEnter a food: pizza\n```\n\nThe game will then generate a story with the given words and print it to the console.",
