  "answer": "Here's a Python program that determines a flight's status based on its departure and arrival times.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef determine_flight_status(departure_time, arrival_time, current_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine a flight's status based on its departure and arrival times.\n\n    Args:\n        departure_time (str): The flight's departure time in 'HH:MM' format.\n        arrival_time (str): The flight's arrival time in 'HH:MM' format.\n        current_time (str): The current time in 'HH:MM' format.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The flight's status.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert times to datetime objects for comparison\n    departure_time = datetime.strptime(departure_time, '%H:%M')\n    arrival_time = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, '%H:%M')\n    current_time = datetime.strptime(current_time, '%H:%M')\n\n    # Check if the flight has departed\n    if current_time >= departure_time:\n        # Check if the flight has arrived\n        if current_time >= arrival_time:\n            return \"Arrived\"\n        else:\n            return \"In Flight\"\n    else:\n        # Check if the flight is scheduled to depart today\n        if departure_time > current_time:\n            return \"Scheduled\"\n        else:\n            return \"Departure Time Passed\"\n\n# Example usage\ndeparture_time = \"08:00\"\narrival_time = \"10:00\"\ncurrent_time = \"09:00\"\nprint(determine_flight_status(departure_time, arrival_time, current_time))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `determine_flight_status` that takes three arguments:\n\n*   `departure_time`: The flight's departure time in 'HH:MM' format.\n*   `arrival_time`: The flight's arrival time in 'HH:MM' format.\n*   `current_time`: The current time in 'HH:MM' format.\n\nIt converts these times to `datetime` objects for comparison and uses if/else statements to determine the flight's status based on the current time relative to the departure and arrival times.\n\nThe function returns one of the following statuses:\n\n*   \"Scheduled\" if the flight is scheduled to depart today and the current time is before the departure time.\n*   \"In Flight\" if the flight has departed and the current time is before the arrival time.\n*   \"Arrived\" if the flight has arrived.\n*   \"Departure Time Passed\" if the flight's departure time has passed and the current time is before the arrival time (this status is not typically used in real-world applications but is included for completeness).\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Scheduling flights: This program can be used to determine the status of flights based on their scheduled departure and arrival times.\n*   Tracking flight progress: By updating the `current_time` argument, the program can be used to track the progress of flights in real-time.\n*   Notifying passengers: The program's output can be used to notify passengers of flight status updates, such as when a flight is scheduled to depart, in flight, or has arrived.",
