  "answer": "**2D Distance Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): (x1, y1) coordinates of the first point\n        point2 (tuple): (x2, y2) coordinates of the second point\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It calculates the distance using the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n4. The program prints the calculated distance to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). The program will output the distance between the two example points. You can modify the `point1` and `point2` variables in the `main` function to calculate distances between different points.",
