  "answer": "**Exponential Growth Calculator**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the exponential growth of a population based on the initial population, growth rate, and time period.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef exponential_growth(initial_population, growth_rate, time_period):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the exponential growth of a population.\n\n    Args:\n        initial_population (float): The initial population size.\n        growth_rate (float): The growth rate of the population (in percent).\n        time_period (int): The time period over which the growth occurs (in years).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final population size after the specified time period.\n    \"\"\"\n    growth_rate = growth_rate / 100  # convert growth rate from percent to decimal\n    final_population = initial_population * (1 + growth_rate) ** time_period\n    return final_population\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Exponential Growth Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    initial_population = float(input(\"Enter the initial population size: \"))\n    growth_rate = float(input(\"Enter the growth rate (in percent): \"))\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    final_population = exponential_growth(initial_population, growth_rate, time_period)\n\n    print(f\"The final population size after {time_period} years is: {final_population:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\nThis program uses the formula for exponential growth:\n\n`P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t`\n\nwhere:\n\n* `P(t)` is the population size at time `t`\n* `P0` is the initial population size\n* `r` is the growth rate (in decimal form)\n* `t` is the time period (in years)\n\nThe program prompts the user to input the initial population size, growth rate, and time period. It then calculates the final population size using the `exponential_growth` function and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the initial population size: `1000`\n3. Enter the growth rate: `5` (in percent)\n4. Enter the time period: `10` (in years)\n5. The program will output the final population size after 10 years: `1628.89`\n\nNote: This program assumes a constant growth rate and does not account for any external factors that may affect population growth.",
