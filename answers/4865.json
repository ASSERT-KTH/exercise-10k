  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        i = 1\n        result = 1\n        while i <= n:\n            result *= i\n            i += 1\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n```\n\nIn this program, the `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers. If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nFor `n` greater than 1, it uses a while loop to calculate the factorial. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and `result` equal to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies `result` by `i` and increments `i` by 1. The loop continues until `i` is greater than `n`, at which point it returns `result`.\n\nFinally, it asks the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using the `factorial` function, and prints the result.",
