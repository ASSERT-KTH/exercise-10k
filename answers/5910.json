  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list of strings and a separator as input and returns a single string with the strings joined by the separator",
  "answer": "Here is a Python function that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef join_strings(string_list, separator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Join a list of strings into a single string using a separator.\n\n    Args:\n        string_list (list): A list of strings to be joined.\n        separator (str): The separator to use between strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A single string with the input strings joined by the separator.\n    \"\"\"\n    return separator.join(string_list)\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\nseparator = \", \"\nprint(join_strings(strings, separator))\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `join()` method of Python strings, which concatenates all the strings in the input list with the separator in between. The result is a single string with the input strings joined by the separator.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example, it will output:\n\n```\nHello, world, this, is, a, test\n```\n\nNote that the `join()` method requires all elements in the input list to be strings. If the list contains non-string elements, you may need to convert them to strings before joining. For example:\n\n```python\ndef join_strings(string_list, separator):\n    return separator.join(map(str, string_list))\n```",
