  "answer": "**Simple Interest and Compound Interest Calculator**\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest and compound interest based on the principal amount, rate, and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n    principal (float): The principal amount.\n    rate (float): The interest rate in percentage.\n    time (int): The time in years.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n    principal (float): The principal amount.\n    rate (float): The interest rate in percentage.\n    time (int): The time in years.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_interest = principal * ((1 + (rate / 100)) ** time) - principal\n    return compound_interest\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate in percentage: \"))\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time in years: \"))\n\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    print(f\"Simple Interest: {simple_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound Interest: {compound_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the simple interest and compound interest.\n\n### Formulae\n\n* Simple Interest: `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`\n* Compound Interest: `CI = P * ((1 + (R / 100)) ^ T) - P`\n\nWhere:\n* `P` is the principal amount\n* `R` is the interest rate in percentage\n* `T` is the time in years\n* `SI` is the simple interest\n* `CI` is the compound interest",
