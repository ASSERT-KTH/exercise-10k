  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes a number as input and uses if/else statements to check if it's a large number.\n\n```python\ndef check_large_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is large (greater than 1000).\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating whether the number is large or not.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num > 1000:\n        return f\"{num} is a large number.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{num} is not a large number.\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Check if the number is large\n    result = check_large_number(num)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function `check_large_number`**: This function takes an integer `num` as input and checks if it's greater than 1000 using an if statement.\n2. **If/else statement**: If the number is greater than 1000, it returns a message indicating that the number is large. Otherwise, it returns a message indicating that the number is not large.\n3. **`main` function**: This function gets user input, checks if the input is a valid whole number, and calls the `check_large_number` function to determine if the number is large.\n4. **Error handling**: The program includes error handling to ensure that the user enters a valid whole number. If the input is invalid, it prompts the user to enter a number again.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `500`, the program will output: `500 is not a large number.`\n* If the user enters `1500`, the program will output: `1500 is a large number.`",
