  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef my_pow(base, exponent):\n    return base ** exponent\n\n# Test the function\nprint(my_pow(2, 3))\n```\nI've written the code in Python, as it's a popular and easy-to-use language. The `my_pow` function takes two arguments, `base` and `exponent`, and returns the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n\nThe test code at the end calls the `my_pow` function with the arguments `2` and `3`, and prints the result to the console. This should output `8`, which is the result of raising 2 to the power of 3.",
