The `distance` function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.\n2. The `brute_force_closest_pair` function finds the closest pair of points using the brute force approach, which has a time complexity of O(n^2).\n3. The `closest_pair` function uses the divide-and-conquer approach to find the closest pair of points. It recursively divides the points into two halves until there are three or fewer points, and then uses the brute force approach to find the closest pair.\n4. The `find_closest_pair` function sorts the points by their x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then calls the `closest_pair` function to find the closest pair of points.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input points are distinct and non-degenerate (i.e., no three points are collinear).
