  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += i\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nresult = sum_of_numbers(n)\nprint(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, the function `sum_of_numbers(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. The `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), adding each number to the `total`. The result is then returned.\n\nYou can replace `n` with any positive integer to calculate the sum for a different range.\n\n**Note:** This program has a time complexity of O(n), which means the running time increases linearly with the size of the input. For large values of `n`, a more efficient formula-based approach can be used, such as the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which calculates the sum in constant time O(1).",
