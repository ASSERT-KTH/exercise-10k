  "answer": "**Linear Equation Solver Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program will take a linear equation of the form `ax + b = c` as input, and return the solution for `x`.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef solve_linear_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a linear equation of the form ax + b = c for x.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The coefficient of x.\n        b (float): The constant term on the left side of the equation.\n        c (float): The constant term on the right side of the equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The solution for x.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If a is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        if b == c:\n            return \"Infinite solutions\"\n        else:\n            return \"No solution\"\n    else:\n        return (c - b) / a\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Linear Equation Solver\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the coefficient of x (a): \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the constant term on the left side of the equation (b): \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the constant term on the right side of the equation (c): \"))\n\n    solution = solve_linear_equation(a, b, c)\n    print(f\"The solution for x is: {solution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n1. Solve the equation `2x + 3 = 7`:\n    * Input: `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 7`\n    * Output: `x = 2.0`\n2. Solve the equation `x - 2 = 4`:\n    * Input: `a = 1`, `b = -2`, `c = 4`\n    * Output: `x = 6.0`\n3. Solve the equation `0x + 2 = 2`:\n    * Input: `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 2`\n    * Output: `Infinite solutions`\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `linear_equation_solver.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python linear_equation_solver.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to input the coefficients and constants of the linear equation.\n5. The program will display the solution for `x`.",
