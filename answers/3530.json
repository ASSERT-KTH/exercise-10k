  "answer": "**Printing a Triangle of Stars using a While Loop**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that prints a triangle of stars (*) using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef print_triangle(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a triangle of stars (*) with the given height.\n\n    Args:\n        height (int): The height of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    row = 0\n    while row < height:\n        # Print spaces before the stars\n        space_count = height - row - 1\n        print(' ' * space_count, end='')\n        \n        # Print the stars\n        star_count = 2 * row + 1\n        print('*' * star_count)\n        \n        row += 1\n\n# Example usage\nheight = 5\nprint_triangle(height)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `print_triangle` function takes the height of the triangle as an argument.\n2. The `while` loop iterates over each row of the triangle, starting from the top.\n3. Inside the loop, it first prints the necessary number of spaces before the stars.\n4. Then, it prints the stars for the current row. The number of stars increases by 2 for each row.\n5. The loop continues until all rows have been printed.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nIf you run the program with a height of 5, it will print the following triangle:\n```\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n```",
