  "prompt": "Write a program to print a pattern of asterisks (*) using nested for loops, where the number of asterisks in each row increases by one.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        print()\n\nprint_pattern(5)\n```\nThis code defines a function `print_pattern(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints a pattern of asterisks (*) using two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and the inner loop prints `i + 1` asterisks in each row, where `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop. The `end=\"\"` argument in the `print()` function is used to prevent a newline character from being printed after each asterisk, so that all the asterisks in a row are printed on the same line. Finally, the function is called with the argument `5` to print a pattern with 5 rows.",
