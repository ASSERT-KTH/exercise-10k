  "prompt": "Create a function that takes in a dictionary and a mapping function, and returns a new dictionary containing the results of applying the mapping function to each value",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a mapping function to each value in a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with the results. This function will take in a dictionary and a mapping function as inputs. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef map_dict_values(input_dict, mapping_func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a dictionary and a mapping function, \n    and returns a new dictionary containing the results of applying \n    the mapping function to each value.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary.\n        mapping_func (function): A function that takes one argument and returns one value.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, \n              but with values that are the result of applying the mapping function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results\n    result_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        \n        # Apply the mapping function to the current value\n        new_value = mapping_func(value)\n        \n        # Store the new value in the result dictionary with the same key\n        result_dict[key] = new_value\n    \n    # Return the result dictionary\n    return result_dict\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `map_dict_values` is defined with two parameters: `input_dict` and `mapping_func`. It initializes an empty dictionary `result_dict` to store the results of applying the mapping function.\n* It then iterates over each key-value pair in `input_dict` using a for loop, applying the `mapping_func` to the current value and storing the new value in `result_dict` with the same key.\n* The function returns `result_dict`, which contains the same keys as `input_dict` but with values that are the result of applying the `mapping_func`.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it easier for users to understand how to use it.",
