  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the modulus of two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_modulus(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the modulus of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n        modulus = calculate_modulus(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The modulus of {dividend} and {divisor} is {modulus}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_modulus` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their modulus.\n*   Inside this function, we check if the divisor is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n*   We use the modulus operator `%` to calculate the remainder of the division operation.\n*   In the `main` function, we take two numbers as input from the user, calculate their modulus, and print the result.\n*   We also include error handling to catch and handle any potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. After entering the numbers, it will display their modulus. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the dividend: 17\nEnter the divisor: 5\nThe modulus of 17 and 5 is 2.\n```",
