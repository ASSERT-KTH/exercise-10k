  "prompt": "Write a program to declare and use a complex variable to store a complex number value.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# Complex Number Program\n\n# Declare a complex variable\ncomplex_num = complex(3, 2)\n\n# Print the complex number\nprint(\"Complex Number: \", complex_num)\n\n# Access real and imaginary parts\nreal_part = complex_num.real\nimaginary_part = complex_num.imag\n\n# Print the real and imaginary parts\nprint(\"Real Part: \", real_part)\nprint(\"Imaginary Part: \", imaginary_part)\n\n# Perform operations with complex numbers\nnum1 = complex(1, 2)\nnum2 = complex(2, 3)\n\n# Addition\naddition = num1 + num2\nprint(\"Addition: \", addition)\n\n# Subtraction\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", subtraction)\n\n# Multiplication\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", multiplication)\n\n# Division\ndivision = num1 / num2\nprint(\"Division: \", division)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by declaring a complex variable `complex_num` using the `complex()` function, passing in the real and imaginary parts as arguments.\n*   We then print the complex number and access its real and imaginary parts using the `real` and `imag` attributes.\n*   Next, we perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using complex numbers and print the results.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Electrical Engineering**: Complex numbers are used to represent AC circuit analysis, filter design, and signal processing.\n*   **Physics**: Complex numbers are used to describe wave functions, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism.\n*   **Navigation and Surveying**: Complex numbers can be used to represent positions and directions in 2D space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Declare a complex variable using the `complex()` function.\n2.  Access the real and imaginary parts of the complex number using the `real` and `imag` attributes.\n3.  Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers using standard operators (+, -, \\*, /).\n4.  Use the results of these operations in your application, such as plotting complex numbers or using them in mathematical formulas.",
