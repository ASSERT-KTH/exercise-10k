  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print a given pattern (e.g. a square of asterisks).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a for loop to print a square of asterisks:\n\n```python\ndef print_square(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a square of asterisks of a given size.\n    \n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the square.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nprint_square(5)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_square` function takes an integer `size` as input and prints a square of asterisks of that size. The outer for loop iterates over the rows of the square, and the inner for loop iterates over the columns. The `print(\"*\", end=\" \")` statement prints an asterisk followed by a space, and the `print()` statement after the inner loop prints a newline to move to the next row.\n\nWhen you run this program with `print_square(5)`, it will output:\n```\n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n```\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of nested for loops to print a two-dimensional pattern. You can modify the `print_square` function to print different patterns by changing the inner loop's logic.",
