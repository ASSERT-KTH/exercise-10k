  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year or not.\n\n    Args:\n    year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.\n2. The function uses the following rules to determine if a year is a leap year:\n\t* The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n\t* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `is_leap_year` function by asking the user to input a year and then printing whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 2020\nOutput: 2020 is a leap year.\n* Input: 2021\nOutput: 2021 is not a leap year.\n* Input: 1900\nOutput: 1900 is not a leap year.\n* Input: 2000\nOutput: 2000 is a leap year.",
