  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, a well-known number pattern:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return fib_sequence\n\ndef print_pattern(pattern):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the numbers in a given pattern.\n    \n    Args:\n        pattern (list): A list of numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for num in pattern:\n        print(num)\n\ndef main():\n    # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    fib_numbers = fibonacci(10)\n    \n    # Print the Fibonacci numbers\n    print(\"The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are:\")\n    print_pattern(fib_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, which are: \n\n```\nThe first 10 Fibonacci numbers are:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n34\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `fibonacci(n)` to generate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers, a function `print_pattern(pattern)` to print the numbers in a given pattern, and a `main()` function to generate and print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. The `main()` function is called when the program is run. \n\nNote that the Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This program uses a while loop to generate the Fibonacci numbers and a for loop to print them. \n\nYou can modify the `fibonacci(n)` function to generate a different number pattern by changing the logic inside the while loop. For example, you could generate the first `n` numbers of the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, ... by changing the line `fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])` to `fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] * 2)`.",
