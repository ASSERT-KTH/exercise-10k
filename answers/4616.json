  "answer": "**Circle Circumference Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius using the formula `C = 2 * \u03c0 * r`, where `C` is the circumference, `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and `r` is the radius of the circle.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\n    return circumference\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n        print(f\"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses the `math` module to access the `pi` constant.\n2. The `calculate_circumference` function takes the radius as input and returns the calculated circumference.\n3. The function checks if the radius is negative and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_circumference` function by prompting the user to enter a radius and printing the calculated circumference.\n5. The program uses a `try`-`except` block to handle any errors that may occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 5: `calculate_circumference(5)` returns approximately `31.42`.\n* Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10: `calculate_circumference(10)` returns approximately `62.83`.",
