  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a variable number of arguments and prints out their sum. This function will be able to handle any number of input values. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes a variable number of arguments\ndef print_sum(*args):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all input arguments and prints it.\n\n    Args:\n        *args: A variable number of arguments\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each argument\n    for arg in args:\n        # Add the current argument to the sum\n        total_sum += arg\n    \n    # Print the total sum\n    print(total_sum)\n\n# Test the function with some numbers\nprint_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_sum` is defined with `*args` as its parameter, allowing it to accept a variable number of arguments. These arguments are collected into a tuple called `args`.\n* Inside the function, a `for` loop iterates over each argument in `args`, adding it to the `total_sum` variable. This variable is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n* After all arguments have been added to `total_sum`, the function prints out the total sum.\n* The function is then tested with a call to `print_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, demonstrating how to use it with multiple input values.",
