  "answer": "**Currency Converter Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that converts currency from USD to EUR or vice versa based on the provided exchange rates.\n\n```python\ndef convert_usd_to_eur(amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts USD to EUR using the exchange rate 1 USD = 0.88 EUR.\n\n    Args:\n    amount (float): The amount in USD to be converted.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The converted amount in EUR.\n    \"\"\"\n    return amount * 0.88\n\ndef convert_eur_to_usd(amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts EUR to USD using the exchange rate 1 EUR = 1.14 USD.\n\n    Args:\n    amount (float): The amount in EUR to be converted.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The converted amount in USD.\n    \"\"\"\n    return amount * 1.14\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Currency Converter Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"1. Convert USD to EUR\")\n        print(\"2. Convert EUR to USD\")\n        print(\"3. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3): \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount in USD: \"))\n            converted_amount = convert_usd_to_eur(amount)\n            print(f\"{amount} USD is equal to {converted_amount:.2f} EUR\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount in EUR: \"))\n            converted_amount = convert_eur_to_usd(amount)\n            print(f\"{amount} EUR is equal to {converted_amount:.2f} USD\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program and select the conversion type (1 for USD to EUR or 2 for EUR to USD).\n2. Enter the amount to be converted.\n3. The program will display the converted amount.\n\nNote: The exchange rates used in this program are hardcoded and may not reflect the current market rates. In a real-world application, you would typically fetch the latest exchange rates from a reliable source, such as an API.",
