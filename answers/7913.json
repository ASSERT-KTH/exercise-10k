  "answer": "**Division Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two integers as input, divides the first number by the second, and prints the quotient and remainder.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get input from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        # Divide the numbers and print the result\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the dividend: 17\nEnter the divisor: 5\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2.\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `//` operator for integer division (i.e., division that returns the quotient as an integer) and the `%` operator to calculate the remainder.\n* The program checks for division by zero and prints an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.",
