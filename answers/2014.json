  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the temperature and humidity as input and returns the corresponding weather forecast using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that takes temperature and humidity as input and returns the corresponding weather forecast:\n\n```python\ndef weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the weather forecast based on the given temperature and humidity.\n\n    Parameters:\n    temperature (float): The current temperature in degree Celsius.\n    humidity (float): The current humidity in percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check for extreme temperatures\n    if temperature < 0:\n        return \"It's freezing! Wear warm clothes.\"\n    elif temperature > 40:\n        return \"It's scorching hot! Stay hydrated and wear light clothes.\"\n\n    # Check for different types of weather\n    if temperature >= 25 and humidity < 60:\n        return \"It's a sunny day! Perfect for outdoor activities.\"\n    elif temperature >= 15 and temperature < 25 and humidity < 80:\n        return \"It's a pleasant day! Ideal for a walk or a picnic.\"\n    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 80:\n        return \"It's a cool day! Wear a light jacket and enjoy the outdoors.\"\n    elif humidity >= 80:\n        return \"It's a humid day! Be prepared for rain or thunderstorms.\"\n\n    # If none of the above conditions are met, return a default message\n    return \"The weather is normal. No special precautions needed.\"\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature in degree Celsius: \"))\n    humidity = float(input(\"Enter the humidity in percentage: \"))\n\n    forecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)\n    print(forecast)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `weather_forecast` function takes the temperature and humidity as input and uses conditional statements to determine the corresponding weather forecast. The function returns a string describing the weather forecast.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the program prompts the user to enter the temperature and humidity, calls the `weather_forecast` function with the user's input, and prints the returned weather forecast.\n\nYou can modify the conditions and the corresponding weather forecasts to suit your needs. This is a basic example and actual weather forecasting is much more complex and involves many other factors.",
