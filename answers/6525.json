  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nHere's a simple implementation of a random number guessing game in Python.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `number_guessing_game` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint`.\n2. The function then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the function reveals the number and ends the game.\n4. The function tries to convert the user's guess to an integer. If this fails, it prints an error message and asks for another guess.\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the function congratulates the user and ends the game.\n6. If the user's guess is too low or too high, the function provides a hint and asks for another guess.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the game, simply execute the `number_guessing_game` function. The game will guide the user through the guessing process. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nToo low! Try again.\nTake a guess: 75\nToo low! Try again.\nTake a guess: 87\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
