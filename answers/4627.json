  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a rotation amount as input, and returns the rotated array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses list slicing to rotate the array:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_array(arr, rotation_amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate the input array by the specified amount.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be rotated.\n        rotation_amount (int): The amount of rotation. Can be positive or negative.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n    rotation_amount = rotation_amount % len(arr)  # Handle cases where rotation_amount is greater than len(arr)\n    return arr[-rotation_amount:] + arr[:-rotation_amount]\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nrotation_amount = 2\nrotated_arr = rotate_array(arr, rotation_amount)\nprint(rotated_arr)  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis program works by using Python's list slicing feature. The expression `arr[-rotation_amount:]` gets the last `rotation_amount` elements of the array, and `arr[:-rotation_amount]` gets all elements except the last `rotation_amount` elements. By concatenating these two parts, we effectively rotate the array.\n\nNote that this program handles cases where `rotation_amount` is greater than the length of the array by taking the modulus of `rotation_amount` with the length of the array. This is because rotating an array of length `n` by `n` or more positions is equivalent to rotating it by the remainder of the division of the rotation amount by `n`.",
