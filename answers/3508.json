  "answer": "Here's a Python program that demonstrates the difference between integer division and floating-point division:\n\n```python\n# Integer Division\ndef integer_division(dividend, divisor):\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend // divisor\n\n# Floating-point Division\ndef float_division(dividend, divisor):\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend / divisor\n\n# Test the functions\ndividend = 10\ndivisor = 3\n\nprint(f\"Integer division of {dividend} by {divisor}: {integer_division(dividend, divisor)}\")\nprint(f\"Floating-point division of {dividend} by {divisor}: {float_division(dividend, divisor)}\")\n\n# Another example with a different dividend and divisor\ndividend = 7\ndivisor = 2\n\nprint(f\"\\nInteger division of {dividend} by {divisor}: {integer_division(dividend, divisor)}\")\nprint(f\"Floating-point division of {dividend} by {divisor}: {float_division(dividend, divisor)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `integer_division` function performs integer division using the `//` operator, which returns the quotient without the remainder. In other words, it rounds down to the nearest whole number.\n*   The `float_division` function performs floating-point division using the `/` operator, which returns a floating-point number representing the exact quotient.\n*   The program tests these functions with different dividend and divisor values to demonstrate the difference between integer and floating-point division.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   When you need to calculate the number of whole items that can be obtained from a certain quantity, integer division is suitable (e.g., calculating the number of boxes that can be filled with a certain number of items).\n*   When you need to calculate a precise ratio or proportion, floating-point division is more suitable (e.g., calculating the average score or the ratio of a quantity to another).",
