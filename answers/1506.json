  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. It uses Python as the programming language and provides a simple, efficient solution.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if the sorted strings are equal\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It removes any whitespace from the strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It sorts the characters in each string and checks if the sorted strings are equal. If they are, the original strings are anagrams.\n4. The `main` function provides example usage of the `are_anagrams` function.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) as the program creates new sorted lists of characters.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the input strings only contain alphabetic characters. If you need to handle strings with other characters, you may need to modify the program accordingly.\n* This program is case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character. If you need a case-sensitive comparison, you can remove the `lower()` calls.",
