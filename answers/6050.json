  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in the current weather conditions and provides a forecast using conditional statements, considering factors such as temperature and humidity.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that takes in the current weather conditions and provides a forecast based on the temperature and humidity:\n\n```python\ndef weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a weather forecast based on the current temperature and humidity.\n\n    Args:\n    temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n    humidity (float): The current humidity as a percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string representing the weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return \"It's going to be a hot and humid day. Expect thunderstorms in the evening.\"\n    elif temperature > 25 and humidity < 60:\n        return \"It's going to be a hot day. Expect clear skies and sunshine.\"\n    elif temperature < 15 and humidity > 80:\n        return \"It's going to be a cold and rainy day. Expect fog in the morning.\"\n    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 80:\n        return \"It's going to be a cold day. Expect clear skies and sunshine.\"\n    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return \"It's going to be a mild and humid day. Expect light rain showers.\"\n    else:\n        return \"It's going to be a mild day. Expect clear skies and sunshine.\"\n\n# Test the function\ntemperature = float(input(\"Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\nhumidity = float(input(\"Enter the current humidity as a percentage: \"))\n\nforecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)\nprint(f\"The weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The `weather_forecast` function takes in two parameters: `temperature` and `humidity`.\n2. **Conditional Statements**: The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity.\n3. **Temperature and Humidity Ranges**: The function checks for different ranges of temperature and humidity to provide a forecast. For example:\n   - High temperature and high humidity: Hot and humid day with thunderstorms.\n   - High temperature and low humidity: Hot day with clear skies.\n   - Low temperature and high humidity: Cold and rainy day with fog.\n   - Low temperature and low humidity: Cold day with clear skies.\n4. **Default Forecast**: If none of the conditions are met, the function returns a default forecast for a mild day with clear skies.\n5. **Testing the Function**: The program prompts the user to enter the current temperature and humidity, calls the `weather_forecast` function, and prints the forecast.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the temperature is 30\u00b0C and the humidity is 70%, the forecast will be: \"It's going to be a hot and humid day. Expect thunderstorms in the evening.\"\n* If the temperature is 10\u00b0C and the humidity is 90%, the forecast will be: \"It's going to be a cold and rainy day. Expect fog in the morning.\"\n* If the temperature is 20\u00b0C and the humidity is 50%, the forecast will be: \"It's going to be a mild day. Expect clear skies and sunshine.\"",
