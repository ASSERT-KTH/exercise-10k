  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and calculates the result. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Handle invalid operations and division by zero.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the result of two numbers based on the given arithmetic operation.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        'addition': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtraction': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiplication': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'division': lambda x, y: x / y\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation.

It uses a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions, which makes the code concise and easy to extend.\n\nThe function checks if the operation is valid and if the operation is division and the second number is zero, raising exceptions accordingly.\n\nThe `main` function gets the numbers and operation from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result. It also catches and handles any exceptions that may occur.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: `calculate(5, 3, 'addition')` returns `8.0`\n*   Subtraction: `calculate(5, 3, 'subtraction')` returns `2.0`\n*   Multiplication: `calculate(5, 3, 'multiplication')` returns `15.0`\n*   Division: `calculate(6, 3, 'division')` returns `2.0`\n*   Invalid operation: `calculate(5, 3, 'modulus')` raises a `ValueError`\n*   Division by zero: `calculate(5, 0, 'division')` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`",
