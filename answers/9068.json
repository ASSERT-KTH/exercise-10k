  "answer": "**Simple Banking System Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a simple banking system. It allows users to deposit and withdraw money using if statements.\n\n```python\n# Define a class for the bank account\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    # Method to deposit money\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. Current balance: ${self.balance}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    # Method to withdraw money\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            if amount <= self.balance:\n                self.balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. Current balance: ${self.balance}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    # Method to check the balance\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n# Main function to simulate the banking system\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nSimple Banking System\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the banking system. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu (e.g., Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, or Exit).\n3. Follow the prompts to perform the chosen action.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you choose to exit the program.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `BankAccount` class is defined with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n2. The `deposit` method checks if the deposit amount is positive and updates the balance accordingly.\n3. The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount is positive and if there are sufficient funds in the account.\n4. The `check_balance` method displays the current balance.\n5. The `main` function simulates the banking system using a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.\n6. The user's choice is read and used to perform the corresponding action.",
