The correct answer was {options['answer']}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function\"\"\"\n    score = run_quiz(quiz_questions)\n    print(f\"Quiz finished! Your score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by entering the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n4. After all questions have been answered, the program will print out your final score.\n\nNote: This is a simple quiz program and does not include any error checking or validation for user input. In a real-world application, you would want to add this to ensure the program runs smoothly and handles unexpected input.",
