  "answer": "**Word Splitter Program**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks for a sentence and splits it into individual words.\n\n```python\ndef split_sentence_into_words(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits a sentence into individual words.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of words in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()\n    return words\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask for a sentence\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")\n\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = split_sentence_into_words(sentence)\n\n    # Print the words\n    print(\"Words in the sentence:\")\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask for a sentence. Enter a sentence, and it will print out the individual words.\n\n```\nPlease enter a sentence: This is a test sentence\nWords in the sentence:\n1. This\n2. is\n3. a\n4. test\n5. sentence\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `split_sentence_into_words` function takes a sentence as input and uses the `split` method to divide it into individual words.\n2. The `main` function asks for a sentence using the `input` function.\n3. It then calls the `split_sentence_into_words` function to split the sentence into words.\n4. Finally, it prints out the words using a `for` loop.",
