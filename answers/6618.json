  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a sentence as input from the user and prints it in sentence case (first letter capitalized, rest lowercase).",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_sentence_case(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a sentence to sentence case (first letter capitalized, rest lowercase).\n    \n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence in sentence case.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sentence.capitalize()\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")\n    \n    # Convert to sentence case\n    sentence_case = convert_to_sentence_case(sentence)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Sentence in sentence case: \", sentence_case)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the built-in `capitalize()` method in Python, which converts the first character of a string to uppercase and makes all other characters in the string lowercase. \n\nHere's how you can use this program:\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a sentence.\n3. The program will print the sentence in sentence case. \n\nFor example, if you enter \"tHiS IS a TeSt SeNtEnCe\", the program will output \"This is a test sentence\".",
