  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the code and enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n2. The computer will generate a random choice and display both choices.\n3. The game will determine the winner based on the game rules and display the result.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter \"yes\" to play again or \"no\" to exit the game.\n\nNote: This code uses a simple `random` module to generate the computer's choice. You can modify the `get_computer_choice` function to use a more complex algorithm if desired.",
