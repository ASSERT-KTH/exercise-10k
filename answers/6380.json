  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the cartesian product of the two lists",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that calculates the cartesian product of two lists.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef cartesian_product(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cartesian product of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the cartesian product of the two lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.product(list1, list2))\n\n# Example usage\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nprint(cartesian_product(list1, list2))\n```\n\nThis program uses the `itertools.product` function from Python's standard library, which generates the cartesian product of input iterables. The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple is a pair of elements, one from each input list.\n\nWhen you run this program with the provided example lists, it will output:\n\n```python\n[(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'c'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\nThis shows all possible pairs of elements from the two input lists.\n\nIf you want to implement the cartesian product from scratch without using `itertools`, you can use nested loops to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef cartesian_product(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cartesian product of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the cartesian product of the two lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for elem1 in list1:\n        for elem2 in list2:\n            result.append((elem1, elem2))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nprint(cartesian_product(list1, list2))\n```\n\nThis version of the function manually generates the cartesian product by iterating over each element in the first list and pairing it with each element in the second list, resulting in the same output as the previous example.",
