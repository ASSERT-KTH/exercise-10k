  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing the elements that are in the first list but not in the second.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_uniq(list1, list2):\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\n\n# Test\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(find_uniq(list1, list2))\n```\nThis code defines the `find_uniq` function, which takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are in `list1` but not in `list2`. The list comprehension iterates over each element `x` in `list1` and checks if it is not present in `list2`. If the condition is true, the element is included in the new list.\n\nThe test at the end creates two lists `list1` and `list2`, calls the `find_uniq` function with these lists as arguments, and prints the result. The output should be `[1, 2, 3]`, which are the elements that are in `list1` but not in `list2`.",
