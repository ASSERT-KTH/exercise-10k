  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle\ndef calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle\n    area = length * width\n\n    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n    return area, perimeter\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle\n    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Area: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_rectangle_properties` that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns a tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n2. The `main` function gets the length and width of the rectangle from the user, calls the `calculate_rectangle_properties` function to calculate the area and perimeter, and prints the results.\n3. The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width.\n4. The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the sum of the length and width by 2.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example, if you enter a length of 5 and a width of 3, the program will output:\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nArea: 15.00\nPerimeter: 16.00\n```\n\nThis indicates that the area of the rectangle is 15 square units and the perimeter is 16 units.",
