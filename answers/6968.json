  "answer": "### Mode Calculation Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following function calculates the mode of a given list of numbers. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all are returned.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    frequency = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]\nmodes = calculate_mode(numbers)\nprint(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the list.\n3. It finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the frequency values.\n4. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency by using a list comprehension.\n5. It returns a list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all are returned.\n\nNote: This function returns all modes if there are multiple modes with the same maximum frequency. If you want to return only one mode in such cases, you would need to decide on a tie-breaker strategy (e.g., return the smallest mode).",
