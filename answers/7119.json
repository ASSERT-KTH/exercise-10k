  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), and score < 60 (F).",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the function get_grade that takes a score as input\ndef get_grade(score):\n    # Use if-elif-else statements to determine the grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif 80 <= score < 90:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif 70 <= score < 80:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif 60 <= score < 70:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user to enter their score\n    score = input(\"Please enter your score: \")\n    \n    # Call the get_grade function with the user's score\n    grade = get_grade(int(score))\n    \n    # Print the grade to the console\n    print(\"Your grade is:\", grade)\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `get_grade` function to determine the grade based on the input score, and the `main` function to prompt the user for their score, call `get_grade`, and print the result. The `main` function is called at the end to start the program.\n\nNote that I used `input` to read the user's input as a string, and then converted it to an integer using `int(score)` before passing it to `get_grade`. This is because `input` returns a string by default, and we need to convert it to an integer to perform numerical comparisons.",
