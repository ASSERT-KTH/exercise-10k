  "answer": "### Function Composition Example\n#### Overview\nIn this example, we will create two simple functions, `double_number` and `square_number`, and then compose them to create a new function, `double_and_square`.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef double_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Doubles the input number.\n    \n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number to double.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int or float: The doubled number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num * 2\n\ndef square_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Squares the input number.\n    \n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number to square.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int or float: The squared number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num ** 2\n\ndef double_and_square(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Doubles and then squares the input number.\n    \n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number to double and square.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int or float: The result of doubling and squaring the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return square_number(double_number(num))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = double_and_square(num)\n    print(f\"The result of doubling and squaring {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We define two functions: `double_number` and `square_number`.\n2. The `double_and_square` function composes these two functions by first doubling the input number using `double_number`, and then squaring the result using `square_number`.\n3. In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the `double_and_square` function with the number 5. The output will be the result of doubling 5 (which gives 10) and then squaring 10 (which gives 100).",
