  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a year as input and returns whether it is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, False otherwise.\n\n    :param year: The year to check\n    :return: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `is_leap_year` function checks if a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar. \n  - A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. \n  - This is implemented in the line `return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)`.\n- The `main` function asks for user input, checks if the input year is a leap year, and then prints the result. \n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `leap_year.py`), then run it from the command line with `python leap_year.py`. When prompted, enter a year to see if it's a leap year.",
