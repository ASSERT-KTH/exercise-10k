  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The game continues until the user decides to quit.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(\"You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice by typing 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n4. To quit the game, type 'q'.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. The `main` function runs the game in a loop, prompting the user for input and displaying the results.\n4. The game continues until the user decides to quit by typing 'q'.",
