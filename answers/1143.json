  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice and compare it to the user's choice.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's choice.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer from the list `[\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]`.\n2. The `get_user_choice` function prompts the user to enter their choice and validates the input to ensure it's one of the allowed choices.\n3. The `determine_winner` function compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n4. The `play_game` function orchestrates the game by getting the user's and computer's choices, printing them out, and announcing the winner.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your choice. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nYou win!\n```",
