  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses another loop to print out the numbers from 10 to 1. Use a for loop for the first part and a while loop for the second part.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\n# First loop: print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Second loop: print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop\ni = 10\nwhile i > 0:\n    print(i)\n    i -= 1\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  The first loop uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using the `range(1, 11)` function. It prints each number in this range.\n2.  The second loop uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 to 1. It starts with `i = 10` and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it prints the current value of `i` and then decrements `i` by 1 using `i -= 1`.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will first print the numbers from 1 to 10, and then print the numbers from 10 to 1.",
