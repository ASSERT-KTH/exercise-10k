  "answer": "**First Duplicate Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far and their indices.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The first duplicate number, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen[num] = i\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    nums = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(nums)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is {duplicate}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_first_duplicate` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty dictionary `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far and their indices.\n3. It iterates over the list of numbers using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and the value of each element.\n4. For each number, it checks if the number is already in the `seen` dictionary. If it is, it means we've found a duplicate, so it returns the number.\n5. If the number is not in the `seen` dictionary, it adds the number and its index to the dictionary.\n6. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a duplicate, it returns `None`.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `find_first_duplicate` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it iterates over the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, it needs to store all numbers in the `seen` dictionary.",
