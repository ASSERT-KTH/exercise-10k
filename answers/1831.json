  "answer": "**Merging Two Arrays**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that merges two given arrays into one.\n\n```python\ndef merge_arrays(array1, array2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two given arrays into one.\n\n    Args:\n        array1 (list): The first array to merge.\n        array2 (list): The second array to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array containing all elements from both input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return array1 + array2\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    array2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    merged_array = merge_arrays(array1, array2)\n    print(\"Merged Array:\", merged_array)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `merge_arrays` function takes two input arrays, `array1` and `array2`.\n2. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two arrays into a new array.\n3. The merged array is then returned by the function.\n4. In the example usage, we define two arrays, `array1` and `array2`, and pass them to the `merge_arrays` function.\n5. The merged array is printed to the console.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nMerged Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple way to merge two arrays in Python. You can modify the `merge_arrays` function to handle more complex merge scenarios or error cases as needed.",
