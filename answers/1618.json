  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and outputs the simple interest.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates simple interest based on principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate simple interest\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates simple interest based on principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n\n    Args:\n    principal (float): The initial amount of money\n    rate (float): The interest rate (in percent)\n    time (int): The time period (in years)\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The calculated simple interest\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert interest rate from percent to decimal\n    rate = rate / 100\n    \n    # Calculate simple interest\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    \n    return simple_interest\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Take input from user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in percent): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Display result\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount (e.g., `1000`).\n3. Enter the interest rate (in percent, e.g., `5`).\n4. Enter the time period (in years, e.g., `2`).\n5. The program will display the calculated simple interest.\n\n### How It Works:\n\n*   The `calculate_simple_interest` function takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input.\n*   It converts the interest rate from percent to decimal by dividing it by `100`.\n*   It calculates the simple interest using the formula `principal * rate * time`.\n*   The `main` function takes input from the user, calls the `calculate_simple_interest` function, and displays the result.\n*   The program uses `float` to handle decimal values and `input` to get user input.\n*   The result is formatted to display two decimal places using `:.2f`.",
