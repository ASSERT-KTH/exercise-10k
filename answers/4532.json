  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef filter_list(lst, condition):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if condition(lst[i]):\n            result.append(lst[i])\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult = filter_list(lst, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\nprint(result)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\nThis code defines a function `filter_list` that takes a list `lst` and a condition `condition` as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input list, and checks each element against the condition using the `condition` function. If the condition is true, the element is added to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list.\n\nThe example usage shows how to use the `filter_list` function to filter a list of numbers and keep only the even numbers. The `lambda` function is used to define a condition that checks whether a number is even (i.e., whether it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). The resulting list contains only the even numbers from the original list.",
