  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and returns the number rounded to the nearest integer.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef round_to_nearest_integer(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number rounded to the nearest integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\n# Test the function\nnum = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The number rounded to the nearest integer is: \", round_to_nearest_integer(num))\n```\n\nThis program uses the built-in `round` function in Python, which rounds a number to the nearest integer. If the decimal part of the number is .5 or greater, it rounds up. If the decimal part is less than .5, it rounds down. \n\nFor example, if you input 3.7, the output will be 4. If you input 3.2, the output will be 3. If you input 3.5, the output will be 4.",
