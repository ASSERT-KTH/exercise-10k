  "prompt": "You are given a dictionary containing student information where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary with keys 'age' and 'grades' which is a list of their grades. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and return the result as a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades.",
  "answer": "### Student Average Grade Calculator\n#### Program Description\nThis program calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary of student information.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student.\n\n    Args:\n    student_info (dict): A dictionary containing student information.\n                         Each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary\n                         with keys 'age' and 'grades' which is a list of their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grades = {}\n    for student, info in student_info.items():\n        # Check if the student has any grades\n        if info['grades']:\n            # Calculate the average grade\n            average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])\n            average_grades[student] = average_grade\n        else:\n            average_grades[student] = None  # or any other value to indicate no grades\n\n    return average_grades\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    student_info = {\n        'John': {'age': 20, 'grades': [90, 85, 95]},\n        'Alice': {'age': 22, 'grades': [88, 92, 89]},\n        'Bob': {'age': 21, 'grades': []}\n    }\n\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grades(student_info)\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        if average_grade is not None:\n            print(f\"The average grade for {student} is {average_grade:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{student} has no grades\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_average_grades` function takes a dictionary `student_info` as input.\n2. It iterates over each student in the dictionary and calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n3. If a student has no grades, it sets the average grade to `None`.\n4. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades.\n5. In the example usage, we create a dictionary `student_info` with three students and calculate their average grades using the `calculate_average_grades` function.\n6. We then print out the average grade for each student, rounded to two decimal places. If a student has no grades, we print a message indicating that.",
