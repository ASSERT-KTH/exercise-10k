  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a looping pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks and spaces. The number of asterisks in each row should increase by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces should decrease by 1, starting from the input number minus 1. The program should use a loop to generate the pattern.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int i, n, j;\n    int space;\n\n    printf(\"Enter the number of rows: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    space = n - 1;\n\n    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (j = 1; j <= space; j++) {\n            printf(\" \");\n        }\n        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {\n            printf(\"*\");\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n        space--;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've followed the specification carefully and implemented the code as described. The code prompts the user to enter the number of rows, initializes the `space` variable, and then uses a nested loop structure to generate the pattern of asterisks and spaces. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and the inner loop prints the spaces and asterisks for each row. Finally, the code decrements the `space` variable and prints a newline character after each row.",
