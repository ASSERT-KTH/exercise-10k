  "answer": "**Circle Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the radius from the user\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the area\n    try:\n        area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_circle_area` function takes the radius as input and returns the area.\n2. The area is calculated using the formula `\u03c0 * r^2`, where `r` is the radius.\n3. The `main` function gets the radius from the user, calculates the area, and prints the result.\n4. Error handling is included to ensure the radius is not negative.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a radius, for example, `5`.\n3. The program will output the area of the circle, for example, `The area of the circle is: 78.54`.",
