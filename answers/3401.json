  "prompt": "Create a dictionary with the names of 5 fruits as keys and their corresponding prices as values.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python code snippet that creates a dictionary with 5 fruits and their prices:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary with fruit names as keys and prices as values\nfruit_prices = {\n    \"Apple\": 1.99,\n    \"Banana\": 0.59,\n    \"Mango\": 2.49,\n    \"Orange\": 1.29,\n    \"Grapes\": 3.99\n}\n\n# Print the dictionary\nprint(fruit_prices)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```python\n{'Apple': 1.99, 'Banana': 0.59, 'Mango': 2.49, 'Orange': 1.29, 'Grapes': 3.99}\n```\n\nThis dictionary can be used to store and retrieve the prices of different fruits. You can access a fruit's price by using its name as the key, like this: `fruit_prices[\"Apple\"]`.",
