  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers and sum them up.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the average\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the numbers using a for loop\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Add each number to the total\n        total += num\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Return the average\n    return average\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\nThis program defines a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input, iterates over the numbers using a `for` loop, and sums them up using the `total` variable. The average is then calculated by dividing the total by the number of elements in the list, which is obtained using the `len` function. Finally, the average is returned and printed to the console.\n\nYou can run this program with different lists of numbers to calculate their averages. For example, you can replace the `numbers` list with `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` to calculate the average of those numbers.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average. You may want to add a check for an empty list and handle it accordingly, for example:\n```\nif len(numbers) == 0:\n    return None  # or some other value to indicate an error\n```",
