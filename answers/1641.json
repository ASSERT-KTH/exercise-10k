  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing Student Information\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that declares variables for a student's name and age, then prints out the values:\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\nYou can also use f-strings for a more readable output:\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(f\"Student Name: {student_name}\")\nprint(f\"Student Age: {student_age}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach: Using a Dictionary\n\nIf you need to store more information about the student, you can use a dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Declare a dictionary\nstudent_info = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 20\n}\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_info[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_info[\"age\"])\n```\n\nThis approach provides more flexibility and scalability for storing and accessing student information.",
