  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays of integers as input, and returns a new array containing only the elements that are in exactly one of the two arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef sym(*args):\n    if len(args) == 1:\n        return args[0]\n    elif len(args) == 2:\n        return [x for x in args[0] if x not in args[1]] + [x for x in args[1] if x not in args[0]]\n    else:\n        return sym(args[0], sym(*args[1:]))\n\n# Test cases\nprint(sym([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4]))  # Output: [3, 5, 4]\nprint(sym([1, 2, 3, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4]))  # Output: [3, 3, 5, 4]\nprint(sym([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4, 4]))  # Output: [3, 5, 4, 4]\n```\nThis code defines a function `sym` that takes a variable number of arguments using the `*args` syntax. It first checks the number of arguments passed to the function. If only one argument is passed, it returns that argument. If two arguments are passed, it uses list comprehensions to find the symmetric difference between the two lists. If more than two arguments are passed, it recursively calls the `sym` function with the first argument and the result of calling `sym` on the remaining arguments.\n\nThe test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs. The function correctly returns the symmetric difference between the input lists, which are the elements that are in exactly one of the lists.",
