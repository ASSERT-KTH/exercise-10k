  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. The average is calculated by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the list length.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n5. It handles any potential errors that may occur during the calculation.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the example list. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
