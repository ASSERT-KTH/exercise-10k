  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that counts the occurrences of a specific element within a list, addressing your request for a straightforward counting solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(lst, elem):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given element in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        elem: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the element in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a counter variable to store the count of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for i in lst:\n        \n        # Check if the current element matches the given element\n        if i == elem:\n            \n            # If it matches, increment the counter\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]\nelem = 2\nprint(count_occurrences(lst, elem))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `count_occurrences` that takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to search in) and `elem` (the element to search for). This function iterates over each element in `lst`.\n*   Inside the function, we initialize a counter variable `count` to keep track of the occurrences of `elem`. We then iterate over each element `i` in `lst`, checking if `i` matches `elem`. If a match is found, we increment `count` by 1.\n*   After iterating over all elements in `lst`, the function returns the total count of occurrences of `elem`, providing the desired count.\n*   An example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a list `lst` and an element `elem`, printing the count of occurrences of `elem` in `lst`.",
