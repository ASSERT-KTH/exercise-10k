If it's a letter, it checks if the letter has already been guessed, if it's in the word, or if it's not in the word. If it's the full word, it checks if the word has already been guessed or if it matches the word to guess.\n4. **Feedback and Updates**: Based on the guess, the program provides feedback and updates the display accordingly. If the guess is correct, it fills in the corresponding blanks. If the guess is incorrect, it reduces the number of tries left.\n5. **Game End Conditions**: The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display a hangman figure and a series of underscores representing the word to guess. You can guess a letter or the full word, and the program will provide feedback and update the display accordingly. The game continues until you guess the word or run out of tries.",
