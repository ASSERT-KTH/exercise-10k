  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints 'Even' if the number is even, and 'Odd' if the number is odd.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Java. Here is the code:\n```\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = s.nextInt();\n        if (n % 2 == 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Even\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Odd\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified:\n\n1. It imports the `java.util.Scanner` class.\n2. It defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that takes an array of `String` arguments.\n3. It creates a `Scanner` object `s` to read input from the standard input stream.\n4. It reads an integer input from the user using `s.nextInt()`.\n5. It checks if the input number `n` is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, it prints \"Even\".\n6. If the number is not even, it prints \"Odd\".\n\nNote that this code does not include any error handling or input validation. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to ensure that the input is a valid integer.",
