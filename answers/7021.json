  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user and performs two operations: it reverses the order of characters in the string and converts all characters to uppercase. The program should then print the modified string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ns = input()\ns = s[::-1]\nprint(s.upper())\n```\nThis code takes a string input from the user, reverses the string using slicing, and then converts the reversed string to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
