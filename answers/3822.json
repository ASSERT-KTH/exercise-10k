  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints out their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers():\n    # Get two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the sum\n    total = num1 + num2\n\n    # Print the sum\n    print(\"The sum is: \", total)\n\n# Call the function\nadd_numbers()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Get user input**: We use the `input` function to get two numbers from the user. We use `float` to allow for decimal numbers.\n2. **Calculate the sum**: We add the two numbers together using the `+` operator and store the result in the `total` variable.\n3. **Print the result**: We use `print` to display the sum to the user.\n\n### Example usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 5\nEnter the second number: 3\nThe sum is:  8.0\n```\n\nNote: This program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers, so the result will be a decimal number even if the inputs are integers. If you only want to work with integers, you can replace `float` with `int`.",
