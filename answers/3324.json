  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers and a target value as input and returns the index of the target value in the array, or -1 if it's not found.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def search(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:\n        return nums.index(target) if target in nums else -1\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a single method `search` that takes two parameters: `nums` (a list of integers) and `target` (an integer). The method checks if `target` is in the `nums` list and returns its index if found, or -1 if not found.\n\nYou can test this code with the following examples:\n```\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(solution.search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6))  # Output: -1\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
