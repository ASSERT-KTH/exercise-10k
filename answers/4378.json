  "prompt": "Write a program that aggregates the values associated with a given key in multiple dictionaries.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that aggregates the values associated with a given key in multiple dictionaries:\n\n```python\ndef aggregate_values(dicts, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Aggregates the values associated with a given key in multiple dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dicts (list): A list of dictionaries.\n        key (str): The key to aggregate values for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of values associated with the given key in the dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    aggregated_values = [d.get(key) for d in dicts if key in d]\n    return aggregated_values\n\n# Example usage:\ndicts = [\n    {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2},\n    {\"a\": 3, \"c\": 4},\n    {\"a\": 5, \"b\": 6},\n    {\"c\": 7}\n]\n\nkey = \"a\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n\nkey = \"b\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [2, 6]\n\nkey = \"c\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [4, 7]\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `aggregate_values` that takes a list of dictionaries and a key as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the dictionaries and extract the values associated with the given key. The `get` method is used to safely retrieve the value for the given key, and the `if key in d` condition is used to filter out dictionaries that do not contain the key.\n\nIn the example usage, we define a list of dictionaries and a key, and then call the `aggregate_values` function to aggregate the values associated with the key. The output is a list of values associated with the given key in the dictionaries.\n\nYou can also use the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module to aggregate the values:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef aggregate_values(dicts, key):\n    aggregated_values = defaultdict(list)\n    for d in dicts:\n        if key in d:\n            aggregated_values[key].append(d[key])\n    return aggregated_values.get(key, [])\n\n# Example usage:\ndicts = [\n    {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2},\n    {\"a\": 3, \"c\": 4},\n    {\"a\": 5, \"b\": 6},\n    {\"c\": 7}\n]\n\nkey = \"a\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n\nkey = \"b\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [2, 6]\n\nkey = \"c\"\nprint(aggregate_values(dicts, key))  # Output: [4, 7]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a `defaultdict` to store the aggregated values, where the key is the given key and the value is a list of values associated with that key. The `get` method is used to safely retrieve the list of values for the given key, and the `defaultdict` is used to handle the case where the key is not present in any of the dictionaries.",
