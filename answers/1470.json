  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two floating-point inputs from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations, and prints the results.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs the specified operations:\n\n```python\n# Get input from user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Perform arithmetic operations\nsum_result = num1 + num2\nproduct_result = num1 * num2\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum_result)\nprint(\"The product of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", product_result)\n```\n\nThis program prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates their sum and product, and then prints the results. The `float` function is used to convert the user's input into floating-point numbers, allowing for decimal values. The `input` function reads the user's input, and the `print` function displays the results.",
