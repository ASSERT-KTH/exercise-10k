  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the total cost of items after adding tax, given the original price and tax rate.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# This is a program to calculate the total cost of items after adding tax.\n# The program is written by [Your Name].\n\n# Section 1: Importing Modules\nimport random\n\n# Section 2: Defining Variables\nprice = 0\ntax = 0\n\n# Section 3: Getting User Input\nprice = float(input(\"Enter the price of an item: \"))\ntax = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (in decimals, e.g. 5% = 0.05): \"))\n\n# Section 4: Calculating the Total Cost\ntotal = price + (price * tax)\n\n# Section 5: Printing the Result\nprint(\"The total cost of the item is: \", total)\n```\nNote that I've left out the author's name, as it was not specified. You can replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name. Also, I've used the `float` function to convert the user input to floating-point numbers, as the `input` function returns a string by default.",
