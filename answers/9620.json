  "answer": "**Trivia Question Generator Program**\n======================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random trivia question based on user input. The program uses a dictionary to store questions, options, and answers for different categories.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Dictionary to store questions, options, and answers\ntrivia_questions = {\n    \"History\": {\n        \"What was the name of the first president of the United States?\": {\n            \"A\": \"George Washington\",\n            \"B\": \"Thomas Jefferson\",\n            \"C\": \"Abraham Lincoln\",\n            \"D\": \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\",\n            \"Answer\": \"A\"\n        },\n        \"Which ancient civilization built the Great Pyramid of Giza?\": {\n            \"A\": \"Egyptians\",\n            \"B\": \"Greeks\",\n            \"C\": \"Romans\",\n            \"D\": \"Mesopotamians\",\n            \"Answer\": \"A\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"Science\": {\n        \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n            \"A\": \"Earth\",\n            \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n            \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n            \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n            \"Answer\": \"C\"\n        },\n        \"What is the process by which plants make their own food?\": {\n            \"A\": \"Respiration\",\n            \"B\": \"Photosynthesis\",\n            \"C\": \"Decomposition\",\n            \"D\": \"Fermentation\",\n            \"Answer\": \"B\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"Sports\": {\n        \"Which team has won the most Super Bowl titles in the NFL?\": {\n            \"A\": \"New England Patriots\",\n            \"B\": \"Dallas Cowboys\",\n            \"C\": \"Pittsburgh Steelers\",\n            \"D\": \"Green Bay Packers\",\n            \"Answer\": \"A\"\n        },\n        \"Who is the all-time leading scorer in the NBA?\": {\n            \"A\": \"Michael Jordan\",\n            \"B\": \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\",\n            \"C\": \"LeBron James\",\n            \"D\": \"Kevin Durant\",\n            \"Answer\": \"B\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef generate_trivia_question(category):\n    \"\"\"Generate a random trivia question based on the user's category choice\"\"\"\n    questions = list(trivia_questions[category].keys())\n    question = random.choice(questions)\n    options = trivia_questions[category][question]\n    return question, options\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Trivia Question Generator!\")\n    print(\"Choose a category:\")\n    print(\"1. History\")\n    print(\"2. Science\")\n    print(\"3. Sports\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter the number of your chosen category: \")\n    \n    if choice == \"1\":\n        category = \"History\"\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        category = \"Science\"\n    elif choice == \"3\":\n        category = \"Sports\"\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n        return\n    \n    question, options = generate_trivia_question(category)\n    print(\"\\nHere's your trivia question:\")\n    print(question)\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if option != \"Answer\":\n            print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n    \n    answer = input(\"\\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, or D): \")\n    if answer.upper() == options[\"Answer\"]:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {options['Answer']}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\n1. Run the program and choose a category by entering the corresponding number.\n2. The program will generate a random trivia question based on your chosen category and display it to you.\n3. Read the question and options carefully, then enter your answer (A, B, C, or D).\n4. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not. If not, it will display the correct answer.\n\n**Note**\n\n* This program uses a simple dictionary to store questions, options, and answers. You can easily add more categories, questions, and options to the dictionary to expand the program's capabilities.\n* The program uses a random number generator to select a question from the chosen category, so you'll get a different question each time you run the program.",
