  "answer": "Here's a Python program that reads a story template with blanks from the user and fills in the blanks with user-provided words:\n\n```python\ndef get_template():\n    \"\"\"Get the story template from the user.\"\"\"\n    template = input(\"Please enter a story template with blanks (use {} for blanks): \")\n    return template\n\ndef get_words(num_blanks):\n    \"\"\"Get the words to fill in the blanks from the user.\"\"\"\n    words = []\n    for i in range(num_blanks):\n        word_type = input(f\"Please enter a type of word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for blank {i+1}: \")\n        word = input(f\"Please enter a {word_type}: \")\n        words.append(word)\n    return words\n\ndef fill_in_blanks(template, words):\n    \"\"\"Fill in the blanks in the template with the given words.\"\"\"\n    story = template.format(*words)\n    return story\n\ndef main():\n    template = get_template()\n    num_blanks = template.count(\"{}\")\n    words = get_words(num_blanks)\n    story = fill_in_blanks(template, words)\n    print(\"Here is the completed story:\")\n    print(story)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `get_template` function prompts the user to enter a story template with blanks, where the blanks are represented by `{}`.\n2. The `get_words` function prompts the user to enter a type of word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and then the word itself for each blank in the template.\n3. The `fill_in_blanks` function uses the `format` method to replace the `{}` in the template with the given words.\n4. The `main` function calls the above functions and prints out the completed story.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nPlease enter a story template with blanks (use {} for blanks): Once upon a time, there was a {} who loved to {} in the {}.\nPlease enter a type of word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for blank 1: noun\nPlease enter a noun: princess\nPlease enter a type of word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for blank 2: verb\nPlease enter a verb: dance\nPlease enter a type of word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for blank 3: location\nPlease enter a location: forest\nHere is the completed story:\nOnce upon a time, there was a princess who loved to dance in the forest.\n```",
