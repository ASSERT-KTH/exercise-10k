  "prompt": "Create a program to generate Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows using a basic algorithm",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows in Pascal's triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n    return triangle\n\ndef print_pascals_triangle(triangle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print Pascal's triangle in a readable format.\n\n    Args:\n        triangle (list): A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - len(row)), end='')\n        for num in row:\n            print(f'{num} ', end='')\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\n    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `generate_pascals_triangle` function initializes a 2D list (or matrix) where each row represents a row in Pascal's triangle. \n- It then fills in the values for each row based on the rule that each number is the sum of the two numbers above it.\n- The `print_pascals_triangle` function prints the triangle in a readable format by adding spaces to align the numbers.\n- In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the number of rows they want in Pascal's triangle, and then the triangle is generated and printed.\n\n### Example Use Case:\nWhen you run this program and enter `5` as the number of rows, it will output:\n```\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```",
