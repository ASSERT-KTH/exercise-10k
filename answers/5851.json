  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for the amount of money they want to give as change and the denominations of the coins they want to use. Then, calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change and print it out",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(amount, denominations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change.\n\n    Args:\n    amount (float): The amount of money to give as change.\n    denominations (list): A list of coin denominations available.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary where the keys are the coin denominations and the values are the number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the denominations in descending order\n    denominations.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the number of coins of each denomination\n    coins_needed = {denomination: 0 for denomination in denominations}\n\n    # Convert the amount to cents to avoid floating point precision issues\n    amount_cents = int(amount * 100)\n\n    # Iterate over the denominations\n    for denomination in denominations:\n        # Convert the denomination to cents\n        denomination_cents = int(denomination * 100)\n\n        # Calculate the number of coins of the current denomination needed\n        coins_needed[denomination] = amount_cents // denomination_cents\n\n        # Update the remaining amount\n        amount_cents %= denomination_cents\n\n    return coins_needed\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the amount of money they want to give as change\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount of money you want to give as change: \"))\n\n    # Ask the user for the denominations of the coins they want to use\n    num_denominations = int(input(\"Enter the number of coin denominations you want to use: \"))\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the coin denominations\n    denominations = []\n\n    # Iterate over the number of denominations\n    for i in range(num_denominations):\n        # Ask the user for the denomination\n        denomination = float(input(f\"Enter denomination {i+1} (in dollars): \"))\n\n        # Add the denomination to the list\n        denominations.append(denomination)\n\n    # Calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed\n    coins_needed = calculate_change(amount, denominations)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Number of coins of each denomination needed:\")\n    for denomination, num_coins in coins_needed.items():\n        print(f\"{denomination:.2f} dollars: {num_coins}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The user is asked to input the amount of money they want to give as change and the number of coin denominations they want to use.\n2. The user is then asked to input each denomination.\n3. The `calculate_change` function calculates the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change.\n4. The result is printed out.\n\n### Example use case\n\nIf the user wants to give $1.37 as change and they want to use $1, $0.25, $0.10, $0.05, and $0.01 denominations, the program will output:\n\n```\nNumber of coins of each denomination needed:\n1.00 dollars: 1\n0.25 dollars: 1\n0.10 dollars: 1\n0.05 dollars: 0\n0.01 dollars: 2\n```",
