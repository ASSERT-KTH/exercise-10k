  "prompt": "Write a program to remove duplicate elements from a given array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses a set to remove duplicate elements from an array.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate elements from a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array with duplicate elements removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(array))\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(array))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. The `remove_duplicates` function takes an array as input.\n2. It converts the array to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values.\n3. It then converts the set back to a list and returns it.\n\nHowever, this solution does not preserve the original order of elements in the array. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_ordered(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate elements from a given array, preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array with duplicate elements removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in array if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates_ordered(array))\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far, and a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the first occurrence of each element. The `or seen.add(x)` part is a trick to add `x` to the set and return `True` if `x` was not already in the set, and `False` otherwise. This allows the list comprehension to filter out duplicate elements while preserving the original order.",
