  "answer": "**Bank Account Management Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to manage a bank account. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an optional initial balance.\n        \n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints the current balance of the account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter the amount to deposit.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the amount to withdraw.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to exit.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance. The `main` function implements the menu-driven interface using a while loop.",
