  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a year as input and prints 'leap year' if the year is a leap year and 'not a leap year' otherwise using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: 'leap year' if the year is a leap year, 'not a leap year' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return 'leap year'\n            else:\n                return 'not a leap year'\n        else:\n            return 'leap year'\n    else:\n        return 'not a leap year'\n\n# Take year as input from user\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n# Print whether the year is a leap year or not\nprint(check_leap_year(year))\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a function `check_leap_year(year)` that checks if a year is a leap year. According to the Gregorian calendar rules, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\nWe then take a year as input from the user, pass it to the `check_leap_year(year)` function, and print the result.",
