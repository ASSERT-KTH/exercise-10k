  "prompt": "Write a program to print the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])\n    return fib_sequence[:n]\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: \"))\nprint(\"The first {} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: \".format(n))\nprint(fibonacci(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.\n*   It starts with a list `fib_sequence` containing the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).\n*   The function uses a for loop to generate the remaining numbers in the sequence, appending the sum of the last two numbers to the `fib_sequence` list.\n*   Finally, it returns the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.\n*   The user is prompted to enter the number of terms they want, and the program prints the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters `5`, the program will print: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`\n*   If the user enters `8`, the program will print: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to generate the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop in Python.",
