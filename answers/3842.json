  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, skipping the number 5:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the counter variable\ni = 1\n\n# Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10\nwhile i <= 10:\n    # Check if the current number is 5\n    if i == 5:\n        # If it is 5, skip to the next iteration of the loop\n        i += 1\n        continue\n    # If it's not 5, print the number\n    print(i)\n    # Increment the counter variable\n    i += 1\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It starts with `i = 1`.\n2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is equal to 5. If it is, it skips to the next iteration of the loop using the `continue` statement.\n4. If `i` is not 5, it prints the current value of `i`.\n5. It increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n6. Steps 2-5 repeat until `i` is greater than 10.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```",
