  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes two points as input and returns the distance between them. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with two example points. The result is printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\nYou can replace the example points with your own coordinates to calculate the distance between any two points.",
