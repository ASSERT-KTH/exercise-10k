  "answer": "### Moving Zeroes to the End of an Array\n\nHere's a Python function that accomplishes this task. This function uses a two-pointer approach to track the position of the next non-zero element.\n\n```python\ndef move_zeroes_to_end(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Move all zeroes to the end of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The array with all zeroes at the end.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the array\n    non_zero_ptr = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # If the current element is not zero, swap it with the element at the non_zero_ptr\n        if arr[i] != 0:\n            arr[non_zero_ptr], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[non_zero_ptr]\n            # Move the non_zero_ptr forward\n            non_zero_ptr += 1\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12, 0]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Array with zeroes at the end:\", move_zeroes_to_end(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  Initialize a pointer `non_zero_ptr` to the beginning of the array. This pointer will track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.\n2.  Iterate over the array. For each element, check if it's not zero.\n3.  If the element is not zero, swap it with the element at the `non_zero_ptr`. This effectively moves the non-zero element to the front of the array.\n4.  After swapping, increment the `non_zero_ptr` to point to the next position where a non-zero element should be placed.\n5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array has been processed.\n6.  The resulting array will have all zeroes at the end.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n*   The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we're doing a single pass over the array.\n\n### Space Complexity:\n\n*   The space complexity is O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the `non_zero_ptr` and other variables, regardless of the size of the input array.",
