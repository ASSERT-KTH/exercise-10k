  "answer": "**Counting Element Occurrences in a List**\n==============================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `count_element`, takes two parameters: a list and a target element. It returns the number of occurrences of the target element in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_element(lst, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.\n    \"\"\"\n    return lst.count(target)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    target_element = 3\n    count = count_element(my_list, target_element)\n    print(f\"The element {target_element} occurs {count} times in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `count_element` function uses the built-in `count` method of Python lists, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `count_element` with an example list and target element.\n*   The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because the `count` method iterates over the entire list in the worst case.\n*   This function works with any type of element that can be compared for equality, including strings, integers, floats, and custom objects.",
