  "answer": "**Pearson Correlation Coefficient Calculator**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two datasets. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. It has a value between +1 and \u22121, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and \u22121 is total negative linear correlation.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_pearson_correlation(dataset1, dataset2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two datasets.\n\n    Args:\n    - dataset1 (list or numpy array): The first dataset.\n    - dataset2 (list or numpy array): The second dataset.\n\n    Returns:\n    - correlation_coefficient (float): The Pearson correlation coefficient.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input data to numpy arrays\n    dataset1 = np.array(dataset1)\n    dataset2 = np.array(dataset2)\n\n    # Calculate the means of the datasets\n    mean1 = np.mean(dataset1)\n    mean2 = np.mean(dataset2)\n\n    # Calculate the deviations from the means\n    deviations1 = dataset1 - mean1\n    deviations2 = dataset2 - mean2\n\n    # Calculate the covariance and variances\n    covariance = np.sum(deviations1 * deviations2)\n    variance1 = np.sum(deviations1 ** 2)\n    variance2 = np.sum(deviations2 ** 2)\n\n    # Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient\n    correlation_coefficient = covariance / np.sqrt(variance1 * variance2)\n\n    return correlation_coefficient\n\ndef check_correlation(correlation_coefficient):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the correlation coefficient indicates strong correlation.\n\n    Args:\n    - correlation_coefficient (float): The Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n    Returns:\n    - correlation_status (str): A message indicating the correlation status.\n    \"\"\"\n    if np.abs(correlation_coefficient) > 0.7:\n        correlation_status = \"The datasets are strongly correlated.\"\n    else:\n        correlation_status = \"The datasets are not strongly correlated.\"\n\n    return correlation_status\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dataset1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    dataset2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\n    correlation_coefficient = calculate_pearson_correlation(dataset1, dataset2)\n    correlation_status = check_correlation(correlation_coefficient)\n\n    print(f\"Pearson correlation coefficient: {correlation_coefficient:.4f}\")\n    print(correlation_status)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `calculate_pearson_correlation` function takes two datasets as input and returns the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n2.  It calculates the means of the datasets and the deviations from the means.\n3.  Then, it calculates the covariance and variances of the datasets.\n4.  Finally, it calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient using the covariance and variances.\n5.  The `check_correlation` function checks if the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.7, indicating strong correlation.\n6.  In the example usage, we create two sample datasets and calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using the `calculate_pearson_correlation` function.\n7.  We then check the correlation status using the `check_correlation` function and print the results.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to handle potential errors, such as division by zero, when calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n*   Consider using a library like SciPy, which provides an implementation of the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation.\n*   Always check the correlation status based on the absolute value of the correlation coefficient to account for both positive and negative correlations.",
