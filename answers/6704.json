  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes an integer as input and returns whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number.\n2. If the number is divisible by any of these values, it is not prime, and the function returns False.\n3. If the number is not divisible by any of these values, it is prime, and the function returns True.\n4. The `main` function takes user input, checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 25\nOutput: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Input: 23\nOutput: 23 is a prime number.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized integers.\n* For larger integers, more advanced algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
