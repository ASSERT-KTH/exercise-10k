  "prompt": "Write a program that generates the first n neon numbers, where n is a user-inputted value. A neon number is a number whose sum of digits is equal to the number itself. Use a while loop to generate the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates the first n neon numbers:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of digits of a number.\n    \n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to calculate the sum of digits for.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of digits of the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))\n\n\ndef generate_neon_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the first n neon numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of neon numbers to generate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n neon numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    neon_numbers = []\n    num = 1\n    while len(neon_numbers) < n:\n        if num == sum_of_digits(num):\n            neon_numbers.append(num)\n        num += 1\n    return neon_numbers\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of neon numbers to generate: \"))\n    \n    # Generate neon numbers\n    neon_numbers = generate_neon_numbers(n)\n    \n    # Print the neon numbers\n    print(\"The first {} neon numbers are:\".format(n))\n    print(neon_numbers)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines two functions: `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits of a number, and `generate_neon_numbers` to generate the first n neon numbers. The `main` function gets user input, generates the neon numbers, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the number of neon numbers to generate. For example, if you enter `5`, it will print the first 5 neon numbers.\n\nNote: The program uses a while loop to generate the numbers, as per your request. However, please note that neon numbers are not a well-known mathematical concept, and the definition used in this program may not be universally accepted.",
