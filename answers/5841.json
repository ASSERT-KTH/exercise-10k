  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Parameters:\n    score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    elif score < 60 and score >= 0:\n        return 'F'\n    else:\n        return 'Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.'\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function gets the score from the user and prints out their grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    \n    print(\"The student's grade is:\", calculate_grade(score))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n*   It uses if-elif statements to check the score against the given conditions and returns the grade accordingly.\n*   The `main` function gets the score from the user, calls the `calculate_grade` function, and prints out the grade.\n*   It also includes error checking to ensure the user enters a valid score.\n*   If the user enters an invalid score, it prompts them to enter a score between 0 and 100.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of 'A'.\n*   Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of 'B'.\n*   Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of 'D'.\n*   Enter a score of 40 to get a grade of 'F'.\n*   Enter a score of 105 to get an 'Invalid score' message.",
