  "answer": "**Median Calculation**\n=======================\n\nThe median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n-----------------------------\n\n1. **Sort the list**: Arrange the numbers in ascending order.\n2. **Check the length**: Determine if the list has an odd or even number of elements.\n3. **Find the median**:\n\t* If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value.\n\t* If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n**Example**\n-----------\n\nSuppose we have the following list of numbers: `[3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 4]`\n\n1. Sort the list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]`\n2. Check the length: The list has 6 elements (even).\n3. Find the median: The two middle values are 3 and 4. The median is the average of these values: `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`\n\n**Code Implementation**\n-----------------------\n\nHere is a Python function to calculate the median:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n    # Check the length\n    n = len(sorted_numbers)\n\n    # Find the median\n    if n % 2 == 0:  # Even number of elements\n        mid1 = sorted_numbers[n // 2 - 1]\n        mid2 = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n        median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n    else:  # Odd number of elements\n        median = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n\n    return median\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 4]\nmedian = calculate_median(numbers)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `calculate_median` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median. The function sorts the list, checks the length, and finds the median according to the rules above. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample list of numbers.",
