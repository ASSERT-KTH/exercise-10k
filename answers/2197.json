  "prompt": "Write a function to compress a given string by replacing repeated characters with a single character and a count of the repetitions. The function should return the compressed string.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to help you implement a function that compresses a given string by replacing repeated characters with a single character and a count of the repetitions. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef compress_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function compresses a given string by replacing repeated characters with a single character and a count of the repetitions.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string to be compressed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The compressed string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the compressed string\n    compressed_str = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize counters for the current character and its count\n    curr_char = \"\"\n    curr_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_str:\n        \n        # If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the count\n        if char == curr_char:\n            curr_count += 1\n        # If the current character is different from the previous one, update the compressed string and reset the count\n        else:\n            # If this is not the first character, update the compressed string\n            if curr_char:\n                compressed_str += curr_char + str(curr_count)\n            # Update the current character and reset the count\n            curr_char = char\n            curr_count = 1\n\n    # Update the compressed string for the last character\n    if curr_char:\n        compressed_str += curr_char + str(curr_count)\n\n    return compressed_str\n\n# Test the function\nprint(compress_string(\"AAABBBCCC\"))  # Output: \"A3B3C3\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by initializing an empty string `compressed_str` to store the compressed string, and two variables `curr_char` and `curr_count` to keep track of the current character and its count.\n*   We then iterate over each character in the input string. If the current character is the same as the previous one, we increment the count `curr_count`. If it's different, we update the compressed string `compressed_str` and reset the count.\n*   After the loop, we update the compressed string for the last character by appending it to `compressed_str` along with its count `curr_count`.\n*   Finally, we return the compressed string `compressed_str`.",
