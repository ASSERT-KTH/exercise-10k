  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a while loop to simulate a game of rock paper scissors between the user and the computer:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"User wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    user_score = 0\n    computer_score = 0\n    play_again = 'y'\n\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice.

(y/n): \")\n\n    print(\"\\nThanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n1. Run the program and enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n2. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n3. The score will be updated and displayed.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to play another round or 'n' to exit the game.",
