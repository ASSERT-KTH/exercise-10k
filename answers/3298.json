  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in a List of Numbers**\n\nHere's a Python program that finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    The first duplicate number in the list, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    numbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate in the list is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We define a function `find_first_duplicate` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  Inside the function, we create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we've encountered so far.\n3.  We iterate through the list of numbers using a for loop.\n4.  For each number, we check if it's already in the `seen` set. If it is, that means we've encountered this number before, so we return it as the first duplicate.\n5.  If the number is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue with the next number.\n6.  If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `None`.\n7.  In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `find_first_duplicate` with an example list of numbers and print the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each number in the list. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all numbers in the `seen` set.",
