  "answer": "### Average Calculation Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following is a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It includes input validation to ensure the input is a list and contains only numbers.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list.\n        ValueError: If the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if input is a list\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty.\")\n\n    # Check if all elements in the list are numbers\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):\n        raise ValueError(\"List must contain only numbers.\")\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    return average\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of these numbers.\n*   It first checks if the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.\n*   Then it checks if the list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n*   Next, it verifies that all elements in the list are numbers (either integers or floats) and raises a `ValueError` if any non-numeric values are found.\n*   Finally, it calculates the average by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers, then returns this average.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_average` with a sample list of numbers and handles any potential errors that might occur during the calculation.",
