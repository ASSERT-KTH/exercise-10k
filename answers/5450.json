  "answer": "**Reversing Sentence Words**\n================================\n\nHere's a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the order of words in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence with words in reverse order.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()\n    reversed_words = ' '.join(reversed(words))\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef main():\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    reversed_sentence = reverse_sentence(sentence)\n    print(\"Reversed sentence:\", reversed_sentence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `reverse_sentence` function splits the input sentence into words using the `split()` method.\n2. It then reverses the order of the words using the `reversed()` function.\n3. Finally, it joins the reversed words back into a sentence using the `join()` method.\n4. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a sentence.\n5. It then calls the `reverse_sentence` function with the input sentence and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence. For example, if you enter \"Hello world this is Python\", the program will output:\n\n```\nReversed sentence: Python is this world Hello\n```",
