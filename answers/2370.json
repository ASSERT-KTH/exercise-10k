  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time_period (int): The time period of the investment (in years).\n        compounding_frequency (int): The frequency of compounding per year (e.g., 1 for annual, 2 for semi-annual, 4 for quarterly).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final amount after compound interest has been applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + interest_rate / compounding_frequency) ** (compounding_frequency * time_period)\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    compounding_frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency per year (1 for annual, 2 for semi-annual, 4 for quarterly): \"))\n\n    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency)\n    interest_earned = final_amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Amount: ${final_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount (e.g., 1000).\n3. Enter the annual interest rate (e.g., 4).\n4. Enter the time period (e.g., 5).\n5. Enter the compounding frequency per year (e.g., 1 for annual compounding).\n6. The program will calculate and display the final amount and interest earned.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The interest rate is assumed to be a decimal value (e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n* The compounding frequency is assumed to be an integer value (e.g., 1 for annual, 2 for semi-annual, 4 for quarterly).\n* The program uses the formula for compound interest: `A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where:\n\t+ A is the final amount.\n\t+ P is the principal amount.\n\t+ r is the annual interest rate.\n\t+ n is the compounding frequency per year.\n\t+ t is the time period in years.",
