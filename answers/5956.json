  "answer": "**Shape Drawing Program**\n==========================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program draws different shapes based on user input. It asks for the shape type, size, and then prints out the drawn shape.\n\n### Supported Shapes\n\n* Square\n* Circle\n* Triangle\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef draw_square(size):\n    \"\"\"Draws a square of a given size.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\ndef draw_circle(size):\n    \"\"\"Draws a circle of a given size.\"\"\"\n    radius = size // 2\n    for y in range(size):\n        for x in range(size):\n            distance = math.sqrt((x - radius) ** 2 + (y - radius) ** 2)\n            if distance <= radius:\n                print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                print(\" \", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\ndef draw_triangle(size):\n    \"\"\"Draws a triangle of a given size.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Shape Drawing Program\")\n    print(\"1. Square\")\n    print(\"2. Circle\")\n    print(\"3. Triangle\")\n\n    shape_type = input(\"Enter the shape type (1/2/3): \")\n    size = int(input(\"Enter the size: \"))\n\n    if shape_type == \"1\":\n        draw_square(size)\n    elif shape_type == \"2\":\n        draw_circle(size)\n    elif shape_type == \"3\":\n        draw_triangle(size)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid shape type.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Select the shape type by entering `1` for square, `2` for circle, or `3` for triangle.\n3. Enter the size of the shape.\n4. The program will print out the drawn shape.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The circle drawing function uses a simple distance-based approach to determine whether a point is within the circle or not.\n* The triangle drawing function uses a nested loop to print out the triangle shape.\n* The program uses `*` characters to represent the shape and spaces to represent empty areas.",
