  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter**\n================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a string, count the frequency of each character and return a dictionary with the characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in frequency:\n            frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[char] = 1\n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(char_frequency(string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the character frequencies.\n2. Iterate over each character `char` in the input string.\n3. Check if `char` is already a key in the `frequency` dictionary.\n   * If it is, increment its value by 1.\n   * If it's not, add `char` as a key with a value of 1.\n4. Return the `frequency` dictionary.\n\n### Alternative Solution using `collections` Module\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(Counter(string))\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(char_frequency(string))\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which provides a convenient way to count the frequency of elements in a collection. The `dict` function is used to convert the `Counter` object to a dictionary.",
