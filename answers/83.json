  "answer": "**Binary Search Algorithm Implementation**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by dividing the array in half and searching for the element in one of the two halves.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `(left + right) // 2`.\n3.  Compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target element `target`.\n    *   If they are equal, return the middle index `mid`.\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is greater than `right`.\n5.  If the target element is not found, return -1 to indicate its absence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a time complexity of **O(log n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it much faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a space complexity of **O(1)**, as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the pointers and variables, regardless of the size of the input array.",
