  "answer": "**Calculating Interest Earned on an Investment**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the interest earned on an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the interest earned on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The interest earned on the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef calculate_total_amount(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total amount after a given time period.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount after the given time period.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_amount = principal + calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    return total_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the interest earned and total amount\n    interest_earned = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    total_amount = calculate_total_amount(principal, rate, time)\n\n    print(f\"Interest earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount after {time} years: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount (e.g., $1000).\n3. Enter the interest rate (e.g., 5%).\n4. Enter the time period (e.g., 5 years).\n5. The program will display the interest earned and the total amount after the given time period.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program assumes simple interest, where the interest rate remains constant over the time period.\n* The interest rate is converted to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n* The program uses two functions: `calculate_interest` to calculate the interest earned and `calculate_total_amount` to calculate the total amount after the given time period.",
