  "prompt": "Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the symmetric difference between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the dictionaries.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to find the symmetric difference between two dictionaries, which includes key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the dictionaries. This will help you understand how to implement the function. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n    \n    The symmetric difference of two dictionaries is a new dictionary containing \n    the key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the input dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the symmetric difference between dict1 and dict2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a new dictionary to store the symmetric difference\n    symmetric_diff = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the items in the first dictionary\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # If the key is not in the second dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict2:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the symmetric difference dictionary\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value\n\n    # Iterate over the items in the second dictionary\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # If the key is not in the first dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict1:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the symmetric difference dictionary\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value\n\n    # Return the symmetric difference dictionary\n    return symmetric_diff\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nprint(symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `symmetric_difference` takes two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` as input and returns a new dictionary containing the symmetric difference between them.\n*   It iterates over the items in both `dict1` and `dict2`, adding key-value pairs to the `symmetric_diff` dictionary if the key is not present in the other dictionary.\n*   The function returns the `symmetric_diff` dictionary, which contains the key-value pairs that exist in exactly one of the input dictionaries.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `symmetric_difference` function with two sample dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2`, and prints the resulting symmetric difference dictionary.",
