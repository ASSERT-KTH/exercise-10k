  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n```python\n# Import the required modules\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"Which planet is the largest in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"Which author wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\": {\n        \"A\": \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\",\n        \"B\": \"Harper Lee\",\n        \"C\": \"Jane Austen\",\n        \"D\": \"J.K. Rowling\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef ask_questions(questions):\n    \"\"\"Ask the user a series of questions and keep track of their score.\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {options['answer']}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz program!\")\n    score = ask_questions(questions)\n    print(f\"Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `quiz_program.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python quiz_program.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to answer the questions.\n5. Your final score will be displayed at the end of the program.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be presented with a series of questions. For example:\n```\nWelcome to the quiz program!\nWhat is the capital of France?\nA: Berlin\nB: Paris\nC: London\nD: Rome\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D):\n```\nYou can enter your answer by typing `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`. If you answer correctly, you will see a message indicating that your answer is correct. If you answer incorrectly, you will see a message indicating that your answer is incorrect and providing the correct answer. Your final score will be displayed at the end of the program.",
