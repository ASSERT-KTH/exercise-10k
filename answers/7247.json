  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, and then performs the specified operation on the numbers. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the specified arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Supported operations are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.\")\n\n    # Perform the specified operation\n    if operation == '+':\n        # If the operation is addition, add the two numbers\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        # If the operation is subtraction, subtract the second number from the first\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        # If the operation is multiplication, multiply the two numbers\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        # If the operation is division, divide the first number by the second\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers and the operation from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the operation and print the result\n        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        # Handle any errors that occur\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n*   The `perform_arithmetic_operation` function takes in two numbers and an operation, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n*   The function checks if the operation is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n*   It then performs the specified operation based on the input operation.\n*   If the operation is division, it checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.\n*   The `main` function gets the two numbers and the operation from the user, calls the `perform_arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also handles any errors that occur during the operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: `perform_arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '+')` returns `15.0`\n*   Subtraction: `perform_arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '-')` returns `5.0`\n*   Multiplication: `perform_arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '*')` returns `50.0`\n*   Division: `perform_arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '/')` returns `5.0`\n\nYou can run the program, enter the two numbers and the operation when prompted, and it will print the result of the operation.",
