  "answer": "**Diamond Pattern Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a for loop to print a diamond pattern based on user input. The user is prompted to enter the size of the diamond, and the program prints the corresponding diamond pattern.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_diamond(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a diamond pattern of a given size.\n    \n    Args:\n    size (int): The size of the diamond pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Print the top half of the diamond\n    for i in range(size):\n        # Print spaces before the asterisks\n        print(\" \" * (size - i - 1), end=\"\")\n        # Print asterisks\n        print(\"* \" * (i + 1))\n    \n    # Print the bottom half of the diamond\n    for i in range(size - 2, -1, -1):\n        # Print spaces before the asterisks\n        print(\" \" * (size - i - 1), end=\"\")\n        # Print asterisks\n        print(\"* \" * (i + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the size of the diamond from the user\n    size = int(input(\"Enter the size of the diamond: \"))\n    \n    # Print the diamond pattern\n    print_diamond(size)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the size of the diamond. For example, if you enter `5`, the program will print the following diamond pattern:\n```\n    * \n   * * \n  * * * \n * * * * \n* * * * * \n * * * * \n  * * * \n   * * \n    * \n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `diamond_pattern.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python diamond_pattern.py`.\n4. Enter the size of the diamond when prompted.",
