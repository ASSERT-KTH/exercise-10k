  "answer": "**Bracket Balance Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program checks if a given string of brackets is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they are properly closed.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string of brackets is balanced or not.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string of brackets.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the string is balanced, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char in bracket_map.values():\n            # If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in bracket_map.keys():\n            # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != bracket_map[char]:\n                return False\n\n    # If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, the string is balanced\n    return not stack\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_balanced(\"({[]})\"))  # True\n    print(is_balanced(\"({[}]\"))  # False\n    print(is_balanced(\"({[]\"))  # False\n    print(is_balanced(\"({}[])\"))  # True\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `is_balanced` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is balanced or not.\n2. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. It defines a dictionary `bracket_map` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.\n4. It iterates over the input string, and for each character:\n   * If the character is an opening bracket, it pushes it to the stack.\n   * If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False.\n5. After processing the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is balanced, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since it processes each character in the string once.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since in the worst case, it may need to push all characters to the stack.",
