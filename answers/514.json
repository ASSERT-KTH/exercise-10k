  "answer": "**Statistical Measures Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array of integers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistical_measures(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = np.mean(arr)\n    median = np.median(arr)\n    std_dev = np.std(arr)\n\n    return {\n        \"mean\": mean,\n        \"median\": median,\n        \"standard_deviation\": std_dev\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    stats = calculate_statistical_measures(arr)\n\n    print(\"Statistical Measures:\")\n    print(f\"Mean: {stats['mean']}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {stats['median']}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {stats['standard_deviation']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. Import the `numpy` library, which provides functions for calculating statistical measures.\n2. Define a function `calculate_statistical_measures` that takes a list of integers as input.\n3. Use `np.mean` to calculate the mean, `np.median` to calculate the median, and `np.std` to calculate the standard deviation.\n4. Return a dictionary containing the calculated statistical measures.\n5. In the `main` function, create an example array and call the `calculate_statistical_measures` function.\n6. Print the calculated statistical measures.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Use a library like `numpy` to simplify calculations and improve performance.\n* Consider using a more robust method for calculating the median, such as the `scipy.stats` library, if you need to handle large datasets.\n* Always validate user input to ensure it is a list of integers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Analyzing exam scores to determine the average performance of a class.\n* Calculating the median salary of employees in a company.\n* Determining the standard deviation of stock prices to assess market volatility.",
