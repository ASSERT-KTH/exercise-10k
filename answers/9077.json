  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints out the day of the year based on a given date using if/else statements. This program assumes that the input date is in the format of month and day.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_day_of_year(month, day):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the day of the year based on the given month and day.\n\n    Args:\n        month (int): The month of the year (1-12).\n        day (int): The day of the month (1-31).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The day of the year (1-365).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the number of days in each month\n    days_in_month = {\n        1: 31,  # January\n        2: 28,  # February (non-leap year)\n        3: 31,  # March\n        4: 30,  # April\n        5: 31,  # May\n        6: 30,  # June\n        7: 31,  # July\n        8: 31,  # August\n        9: 30,  # September\n        10: 31,  # October\n        11: 30,  # November\n        12: 31  # December\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the day of the year\n    day_of_year = 0\n\n    # Calculate the day of the year\n    for i in range(1, month):\n        if i == 2:  # February\n            day_of_year += 28\n        elif i in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:  # Months with 31 days\n            day_of_year += 31\n        else:  # Months with 30 days\n            day_of_year += 30\n\n    # Add the day of the month to the day of the year\n    day_of_year += day\n\n    return day_of_year\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the month and day from the user\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day (1-31): \"))\n\n    # Validate the input\n    if month < 1 or month > 12:\n        print(\"Invalid month. Please enter a number between 1 and 12.\")\n    elif day < 1 or day > 31:\n        print(\"Invalid day. Please enter a number between 1 and 31.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate and print the day of the year\n        day_of_year = calculate_day_of_year(month, day)\n        print(f\"The day of the year is: {day_of_year}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Note:** This program does not account for leap years, where February has 29 days. If you want to account for leap years, you would need to add additional logic to the `calculate_day_of_year` function to check if the year is a leap year and adjust the number of days in February accordingly.\n\nHere's an updated version of the `calculate_day_of_year` function that accounts for leap years:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_day_of_year(month, day, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the day of the year based on the given month, day, and year.\n\n    Args:\n        month (int): The month of the year (1-12).\n        day (int): The day of the month (1-31).\n        year (int): The year.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The day of the year (1-365 or 366 for leap years).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the number of days in each month\n    days_in_month = {\n        1: 31,  # January\n        2: 28,  # February (non-leap year)\n        3: 31,  # March\n        4: 30,  # April\n        5: 31,  # May\n        6: 30,  # June\n        7: 31,  # July\n        8: 31,  # August\n        9: 30,  # September\n        10: 31,  # October\n        11: 30,  # November\n        12: 31  # December\n    }\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):\n        days_in_month[2] = 29  # February has 29 days in a leap year\n\n    # Initialize the day of the year\n    day_of_year = 0\n\n    # Calculate the day of the year\n    for i in range(1, month):\n        day_of_year += days_in_month",
