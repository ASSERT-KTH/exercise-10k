  "answer": "**Stock Market Simulator Program**\n\nThis program simulates a simple stock market where users can buy and sell stocks. The program uses a dictionary to store the available stocks and their prices. The user can view the available stocks, buy stocks, sell stocks, and view their portfolio.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass StockMarket:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stocks = {\n            \"Apple\": 150.0,\n            \"Google\": 2500.0,\n            \"Amazon\": 3000.0,\n            \"Microsoft\": 200.0,\n            \"Facebook\": 250.0\n        }\n        self.user_portfolio = {}\n\n    def display_stocks(self):\n        print(\"Available Stocks:\")\n        for stock, price in self.stocks.items():\n            print(f\"{stock}: ${price:.2f}\")\n\n    def buy_stock(self):\n        self.display_stocks()\n        stock_name = input(\"Enter the stock name to buy: \")\n        if stock_name in self.stocks:\n            quantity = int(input(\"Enter the quantity to buy: \"))\n            price = self.stocks[stock_name]\n            total_cost = quantity * price\n            if stock_name in self.user_portfolio:\n                self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"quantity\"] += quantity\n                self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"total_cost\"] += total_cost\n            else:\n                self.user_portfolio[stock_name] = {\n                    \"quantity\": quantity,\n                    \"total_cost\": total_cost\n                }\n            print(f\"You bought {quantity} shares of {stock_name} at ${price:.2f} each.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Stock not found.\")\n\n    def sell_stock(self):\n        if not self.user_portfolio:\n            print(\"You don't have any stocks to sell.\")\n            return\n        print(\"Your Portfolio:\")\n        for stock, info in self.user_portfolio.items():\n            print(f\"{stock}: {info['quantity']} shares\")\n        stock_name = input(\"Enter the stock name to sell: \")\n        if stock_name in self.user_portfolio:\n            quantity = int(input(\"Enter the quantity to sell: \"))\n            if quantity > self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"quantity\"]:\n                print(\"You don't have enough shares to sell.\")\n                return\n            price = self.stocks[stock_name]\n            total_revenue = quantity * price\n            self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"quantity\"] -= quantity\n            self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"total_cost\"] -= total_revenue\n            if self.user_portfolio[stock_name][\"quantity\"] == 0:\n                del self.user_portfolio[stock_name]\n            print(f\"You sold {quantity} shares of {stock_name} at ${price:.2f} each.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"You don't own any shares of this stock.\")\n\n    def display_portfolio(self):\n        if not self.user_portfolio:\n            print(\"You don't have any stocks in your portfolio.\")\n            return\n        print(\"Your Portfolio:\")\n        for stock, info in self.user_portfolio.items():\n            print(f\"{stock}: {info['quantity']} shares, Total Cost: ${info['total_cost']:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    market = StockMarket()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nStock Market Simulator\")\n        print(\"1.

The program defines a `StockMarket` class that stores the available stocks and their prices in a dictionary.\n2. The `display_stocks` method displays the available stocks and their prices.\n3. The `buy_stock` method allows the user to buy stocks by entering the stock name and quantity. It updates the user's portfolio accordingly.\n4. The `sell_stock` method allows the user to sell stocks by entering the stock name and quantity. It updates the user's portfolio accordingly.\n5. The `display_portfolio` method displays the user's portfolio, including the stocks they own and the total cost.\n6. The `main` function creates an instance of the `StockMarket` class and provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the stock market simulator.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to display the available stocks.\n2. Select option 2 to buy stocks. Enter the stock name (e.g., \"Apple\") and quantity (e.g., 10).\n3. Select option 4 to display your portfolio. You should see",
