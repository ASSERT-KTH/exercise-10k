The `merge_sort` function recursively splits the input array into smaller subarrays until each subarray has one or fewer elements, and then merges these subarrays using the `merge` function. The `merge` function takes two sorted arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `merge_sort` function to sort an array of integers. The output will be the sorted array.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1.  The `merge_sort` function checks if the input array has one or fewer elements. If so, it returns the array as it's already sorted.\n2.  The array is split into two halves, `left_half` and `right_half`.\n3.  The `merge_sort` function is recursively called on both halves to sort them individually.\n4.  The sorted `left_half` and `right_half` are then merged using the `merge` function.\n5.  The `merge` function compares elements from both sorted arrays and appends the smaller element to the `merged` array.\n6.  Once one of the arrays is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other array are appended to the `merged` array.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\nThe time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the array is recursively split into smaller subarrays, resulting in a logarithmic number of levels. At each level, the elements are merged, resulting in a linear number of comparisons.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n\nThe space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n), as additional space is required to store the temporary subarrays during the sorting process.",
