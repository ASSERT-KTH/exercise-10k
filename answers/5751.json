  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python\n\nBelow is an example Python program that declares variables, performs basic arithmetic operations, and prints the results.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 5\n\n# Perform basic arithmetic operations\naddition = num1 + num2\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\ndivision = num1 / num2\nmodulus = num1 % num2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Arithmetic Operations Results:\")\nprint(\"-----------------------------\")\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\nprint(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\nprint(f\"Modulus: {num1} % {num2} = {modulus}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: `num1` and `num2` are declared with values `10` and `5`, respectively.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - `addition`: The `+` operator is used for addition.\n   - `subtraction`: The `-` operator is used for subtraction.\n   - `multiplication`: The `*` operator is used for multiplication.\n   - `division`: The `/` operator is used for division.\n   - `modulus`: The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.\n3. **Printing Results**: The results of each operation are printed using f-strings, which allow for embedding expressions inside string literals.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nArithmetic Operations Results:\n-----------------------------\nAddition: 10 + 5 = 15\nSubtraction: 10 - 5 = 5\nMultiplication: 10 * 5 = 50\nDivision: 10 / 5 = 2.0\nModulus: 10 % 5 = 0\n```",
