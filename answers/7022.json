  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank account transaction system. The system should allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Use a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit. Use a for loop to display the transaction history.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that simulates a bank account transaction system:\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the bank account with a balance of 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = balance\n        self.transaction_history = []\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit a specified amount into the bank account.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance += amount\n        self.transaction_history.append(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw a specified amount from the bank account if sufficient funds are available.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n            self.transaction_history.append(f\"Withdrawal of ${amount:.2f} failed\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            self.transaction_history.append(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Display the current balance of the bank account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def display_transaction_history(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Display the transaction history of the bank account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"\\nTransaction History:\")\n        for i, transaction in enumerate(self.transaction_history, start=1):\n            print(f\"{i}. {transaction}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Transaction System\")\n        print(\"1.

If yes, it updates the balance and transaction history; otherwise, it displays an error message.\n3.  **Check Balance**: The user chooses option 3, and the program displays the current balance.\n4.  **Display Transaction History**: The user chooses option 4, and the program displays the transaction history using a for loop.\n5.  **Exit**: The user chooses option 5, and the program exits the loop and terminates.",
