  "answer": "**Division Program**\n======================\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input, divides the first number by the second, and returns the quotient and remainder.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend: float, divisor: float) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n    - dividend (float): The number being divided.\n    - divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n    - tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    \n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    \n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"Quotient: {quotient}\")\n        print(f\"Remainder: {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `divide_numbers` function takes two arguments: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n3. The quotient is calculated using the floor division operator (`//`).\n4. The remainder is calculated using the modulus operator (`%`).\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `divide_numbers` function with user input.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Divide 17 by 5:\n\t+ Quotient: 3\n\t+ Remainder: 2\n* Divide 10 by 2:\n\t+ Quotient: 5\n\t+ Remainder: 0",
