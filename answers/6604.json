  "answer": "**Quote Printer Program**\n```python\ndef print_quote(quote: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a given quote to the console, including the quotation marks.\n\n    Args:\n        quote (str): The quote to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f'\"{quote}\"')\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main() -> None:\n    quote = \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\"\n    print_quote(quote)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Define a function `print_quote` that takes a string `quote` as input.\n2. Use an f-string to format the output with quotation marks around the quote.\n3. In the `main` function, specify the quote to be printed and call `print_quote`.\n4. Use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure `main` is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n\"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\"\n```",
