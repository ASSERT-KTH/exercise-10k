It allows users to add questions, view all questions, play the quiz game, and check their scores.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass QuizGame:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.questions = {}\n\n    def add_question(self, question, answer):\n        \"\"\"Add a question and answer to the quiz game\"\"\"\n        self.questions[question] = answer\n        print(f\"Question '{question}' added successfully!\")\n\n    def view_questions(self):\n        \"\"\"View all questions in the quiz game\"\"\"\n        if not self.questions:\n            print(\"No questions added yet!\")\n        else:\n            for question, answer in self.questions.items():\n                print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n                print(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n                print(\"------------------------\")\n\n    def play_quiz(self):\n        \"\"\"Play the quiz game\"\"\"\n        if not self.questions:\n            print(\"No questions added yet!\")\n        else:\n            score = 0\n            for question, answer in self.questions.items():\n                user_answer = input(f\"Question: {question}\\nYour answer: \")\n                if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n                    print(\"Correct answer!\\n\")\n                    score += 1\n                else:\n                    print(f\"Incorrect answer. The correct answer was {answer}.\\n\")\n            print(f\"Quiz finished! Your final score is {score} out of {len(self.questions)}.\")\n\n    def check_score(self, score):\n        \"\"\"Check the user's score\"\"\"\n        if score == len(self.questions):\n            print(\"Congratulations! You scored perfectly!\")\n        elif score / len(self.questions) >= 0.5:\n            print(\"Good job! You scored above average.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Better luck next time! You scored below average.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    quiz_game = QuizGame()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nQuiz Game Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Question\")\n        print(\"2.

Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            question = input(\"Enter your question: \")\n            answer = input(\"Enter the answer: \")\n            quiz_game.add_question(question, answer)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            quiz_game.view_questions()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            quiz_game.play_quiz()\n            score = sum(1 for q, a in quiz_game.questions.items() if input(f\"Question: {q}\\nYour answer: \").lower() == a.lower())\n            quiz_game.check_score(score)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice.
