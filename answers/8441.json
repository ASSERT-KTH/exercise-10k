  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the given income using conditional statements. The tax rates are assumed to be as follows:\n\n* 10% for income up to $10,000\n* 15% for income between $10,001 and $20,000\n* 20% for income between $20,001 and $50,000\n* 25% for income above $50,000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax amount based on the given income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif income <= 10000:\n        return income * 0.10\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 10000) * 0.15)\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + (10000 * 0.15) + ((income - 20000) * 0.20)\n    else:\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + (10000 * 0.15) + (30000 * 0.20) + ((income - 50000) * 0.25)\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax amount is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes an income amount as input and returns the calculated tax amount.\n2. The function uses conditional statements to determine the tax rate based on the income amount.\n3. The tax rate is applied to the corresponding income range, and the tax amount is calculated.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their income, calculates the tax amount using the `calculate_tax` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Enter your income: $25000\n* Your tax amount is: $3500.00\n\nNote: This program assumes a simple tax structure and does not account for other factors that may affect tax calculations, such as deductions, exemptions, or state taxes.",
