  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the multiplication table of a given number up to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number for which the multiplication table is to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{num} x {i} = {num * i}\")\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    print_multiplication_table(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `print_multiplication_table` function takes an integer `num` as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.\n*   The `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using `range(1, 11)`.\n*   Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication of `num` with the current iteration number `i` using an f-string.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `print_multiplication_table` function to print its multiplication table.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a number. Let's say you enter `5`. The program will then print the multiplication table of 5 up to 10:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```",
