  "answer": "Variable Scope in Python\n=========================\n\n### Introduction\n\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and accessible. In Python, variables can be defined at different scopes, including global and local.\n\n### Code Demonstration\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = \"I am global\"\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Local variable\n    local_variable = \"I am local\"\n    \n    # Accessing global variable\n    print(\"Inside function: Global variable =\", global_variable)\n    \n    # Accessing local variable\n    print(\"Inside function: Local variable =\", local_variable)\n\n# Accessing global variable\nprint(\"Outside function: Global variable =\", global_variable)\n\n# Trying to access local variable outside function will result in error\ntry:\n    print(\"Outside function: Local variable =\", local_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Error: Local variable is not defined outside function\")\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We start by declaring a global variable `global_variable` with the value `\"I am global\"`.\n2.  We define a function `my_function()` where we declare a local variable `local_variable` with the value `\"I am local\"`.\n3.  Inside the function, we can access both the global variable `global_variable` and the local variable `local_variable`.\n4.  Outside the function, we can access the global variable `global_variable` but trying to access the local variable `local_variable` results in a `NameError` because it is not defined in the global scope.\n5.  Finally, we call the `my_function()` to demonstrate the variable scope.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOutside function: Global variable = I am global\nError: Local variable is not defined outside function\nInside function: Global variable = I am global\nInside function: Local variable = I am local\n```\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   **Global variables** are defined outside any function and are accessible throughout the program.\n*   **Local variables** are defined inside a function and are only accessible within that function.\n*   Trying to access a local variable outside its function will result in a `NameError`.",
