  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI based on the following formula: BMI = weight / height^2.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the BMI of a person.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): The weight of the person in kg.\n        height (float): The height of the person in meters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated BMI.\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef get_bmi_category(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the BMI category based on the calculated BMI.\n\n    Args:\n        bmi (float): The calculated BMI.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding BMI category.\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal\"\n    elif bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for weight and height\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n    # Determine the BMI category\n    category = get_bmi_category(bmi)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your BMI category is: {category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines three functions: `calculate_bmi`, `get_bmi_category`, and `main`. The `calculate_bmi` function calculates the BMI based on the provided weight and height. The `get_bmi_category` function determines the BMI category based on the calculated BMI. The `main` function gets the user's weight and height as input, calculates the BMI, determines the BMI category, and prints the results.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your weight and height. After you enter the values, it will calculate and display your BMI and the corresponding BMI category.\n\n```\nEnter your weight in kg: 70\nEnter your height in meters: 1.75\nYour BMI is: 22.86\nYour BMI category is: Normal\n```",
