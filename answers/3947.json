  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program validates a password based on the following rules:\n\n* At least 8 characters long\n* Contains at least one uppercase letter\n* Contains at least one lowercase letter\n* Contains at least one number\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the given rules.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the rules\n    rules = [\n        lambda x: len(x) >= 8,  # At least 8 characters long\n        lambda x: any(c.isupper() for c in x),  # At least one uppercase letter\n        lambda x: any(c.islower() for c in x),  # At least one lowercase letter\n        lambda x: any(c.isdigit() for c in x)  # At least one number\n    ]\n\n    # Check each rule\n    for rule in rules:\n        if not rule(password):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    passwords = [\n        \"weak\",  # Too short\n        \"Strong\",  # No number\n        \"Strong1\",  # Valid\n        \"weak123\"  # No uppercase letter\n    ]\n\n    for password in passwords:\n        print(f\"Password: {password}, Valid: {validate_password(password)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses a list of lambda functions to define the validation rules. Each lambda function checks a specific rule, such as the length of the password or the presence of an uppercase letter. The `validate_password` function iterates over these rules and returns False as soon as any rule is not met. If all rules are met, the function returns True.\n\nThe `main` function tests the `validate_password` function with a list of example passwords and prints the results.\n\n### Alternative Solution using Regular Expressions\n\nYou can also use regular expressions to validate the password in a single line of code:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    return bool(re.match(r\"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).{8,}$\", password))\n```\nThis regular expression checks for the presence of at least one lowercase letter (`[a-z]`), one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`), one number (`\\d`), and a minimum length of 8 characters (`.{8,}`) using positive lookaheads (`(?=...)`).",
