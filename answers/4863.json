  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random number and gives the user 5 chances to guess it. After each guess, it provides feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\".\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 5\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    print(\"You have 5 attempts to guess it.\")\n    \n    for attempt in range(attempts):\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1} of {attempts}: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempt + 1} attempts.\")\n            return\n        \n        # Provide feedback to the user\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n    \n    # If the user has used up all their attempts, reveal the number\n    print(f\"Sorry, you didn't guess the number. The number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `number_guessing_game` function. The program will guide the user through the game, prompting them for their guesses and providing feedback after each attempt. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program will congratulate them and end. If the user uses up all their attempts without guessing the number, the program will reveal the correct answer.",
