The area is calculated using Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths `a`, `b`, `c` and semi-perimeter `s` is given by `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the input sides can form a triangle. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. **Calculate Semi-Perimeter**: The semi-perimeter `s` is calculated as `(a + b + c) / 2`.\n3. **Calculate Area**: The area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula.\n4. **Calculate Circumradius**: The circumradius `R` is calculated using the formula `R = abc / (4 * area)`.\n5. **Test the Function**: The program tests the function with user input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   If you input the sides of an equilateral triangle (e.g., `a = 5`, `b = 5`, `c = 5`), the program will output the length of the circumradius, which is `5 * sqrt(3) / 3`.\n*   If you input the sides of a right-angled triangle (e.g., `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 5`), the program will output the length of the circumradius, which is `5 / 2`.",
