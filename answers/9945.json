  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should define two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. Both functions should take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef area_rect(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef perimeter_rect(length, width):\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return perimeter\n\n# Example usage:\nlength = 10\nwidth = 20\nprint(\"Area:\", area_rect(length, width))\nprint(\"Perimeter:\", perimeter_rect(length, width))\n```\n\nThis code defines the two functions, `area_rect` and `perimeter_rect`, which calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, respectively. The example usage demonstrates how to use these functions with specific values for the length and width of the rectangle.",
