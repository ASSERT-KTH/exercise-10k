  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Squares**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the sum of the squares of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of the squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the squares of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([x**2 for x in numbers])\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of the squares is:\", result)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `sum_of_squares` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to square each number in the list.\n3. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of the squared numbers.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n**Alternative Solution**\n------------------------\n\nYou can also use the `map` function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    return sum(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `map` function to apply the lambda function `x**2` to each number in the list, and then uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the results.",
