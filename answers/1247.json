  "answer": "### Function with Annotations\n\nHere's an example of a function that takes two integers as input, adds them together, and returns the result. This function includes type annotations for the input arguments and return value.\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two integers together.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = add_numbers(5, 7)\n    print(f\"The sum is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, both of which are annotated as `int`.\n*   The function returns an `int` value, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.\n*   The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, the input arguments, and the return value.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to call the `add_numbers` function with two integers and print the result.",
