  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a mapping function as input and returns a new list containing the results of applying the mapping function to each element.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef map_list(input_list, mapping_function):\n    new_list = []\n    for x in input_list:\n        new_list.append(mapping_function(x))\n    return new_list\n\nlist = [1, 2, 3]\nresult = map_list(list, lambda x: x*x)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code defines the `map_list` function, which takes a list and a mapping function as input, applies the mapping function to each element of the list, and returns a new list containing the results. The code then demonstrates the usage of the `map_list` function with a lambda function that squares each number in the input list. The output of the code will be `[1, 4, 9]`, which is the expected result.",
