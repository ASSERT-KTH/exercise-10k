The `merge_sort` function takes an input array and recursively divides it into two halves until each half has 1 or 0 elements (the base case).\n2. The `merge` function merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array by comparing elements and appending the smaller one to the merged array.\n3. The `merge_sort` function returns the sorted array by merging the recursively sorted halves.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\nThe time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the algorithm divides the array in half at each recursive step, resulting in log n levels of recursion, and each level takes O(n) time to merge the sorted halves.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n\nThe space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n), as the algorithm requires additional space to store the merged array.",
