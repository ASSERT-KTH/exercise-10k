  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in three numbers and outputs the maximum number based on the following conditions: if the first number is greater than the second and third numbers, output the first number, if the second number is greater than the first and third numbers, output the second number, if the third number is greater than the first and second numbers, output the third number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(num1, num2, num3):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number.\n    \n    The maximum number is determined based on the conditions:\n    - If the first number is greater than the second and third numbers, return the first number.\n    - If the second number is greater than the first and third numbers, return the second number.\n    - If the third number is greater than the first and second numbers, return the third number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the first number is greater than the second and third numbers\n    if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:\n        return num1\n    \n    # Check if the second number is greater than the first and third numbers\n    elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:\n        return num2\n    \n    # Check if the third number is greater than the first and second numbers\n    elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:\n        return num3\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\nnum3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\nmax_number = find_max_number(num1, num2, num3)\nprint(\"The maximum number is: \", max_number)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `find_max_number` that takes three numbers `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` as arguments.\n- Inside the function, we use if-elif statements to check the conditions and return the maximum number.\n- We use the `input` function to get the three numbers from the user.\n- We call the `find_max_number` function with the user's input and print the result. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the conditions specified in the problem are not necessary to find the maximum number. A simpler approach would be to use the built-in `max` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. Here is a simplified version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(num1, num2, num3):\n    return max(num1, num2, num3)\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\nnum3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\nmax_number = find_max_number(num1, num2, num3)\nprint(\"The maximum number is: \", max_number)\n```\n\nThis code achieves the same result but is more concise and efficient.",
