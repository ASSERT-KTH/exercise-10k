  "answer": "**GCD Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the GCD\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The `main` function gets two numbers as input from the user, calculates their GCD using the `calculate_gcd` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `12` and `15`, Output: `3`\n* Input: `24` and `30`, Output: `6`\n* Input: `48` and `18`, Output: `6`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `gcd_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python gcd_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers, and the program will print their GCD.",
