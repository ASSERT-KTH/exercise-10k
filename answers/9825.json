  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input and checks if it is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print the reversed string. Otherwise, it should print a message indicating that the string is not a palindrome. The program should handle strings with spaces and special characters by ignoring them and considering only alphanumeric characters. It should also be case-insensitive.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    s = s.lower()  # convert to lowercase\n    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())  # remove non-alphanumeric characters\n    reversed_s = s[::-1]  # reverse the string\n    if s == reversed_s:\n        print(reversed_s)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not a palindrome\")\n\n# Test cases\nis_palindrome(\"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\")\nis_palindrome(\"Not a palindrome\")\nis_palindrome(\"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\")\nis_palindrome(\"Hello\")\n```\nThis code defines the `is_palindrome` function, which takes a string `s` as input and checks if it is a palindrome. It then tests the function with the four test cases provided.",
