  "prompt": "Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.",
  "answer": "**Hello World Program**\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `main` function contains the code to be executed when the program runs.\n* The `print` function is used to output 'Hello, World!' to the console.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\n1. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python hello_world.py`).\n4. You should see 'Hello, World!' printed to the console.",
