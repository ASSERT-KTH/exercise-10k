  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their scores on different assignments. The grade is calculated as a weighted average of the scores, where each assignment has a specific weight.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.assignments = {}\n\n    def add_assignment(self, name, score, weight):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add an assignment to the student's record.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): Name of the assignment.\n            score (float): Score achieved on the assignment (out of 100).\n            weight (float): Weight of the assignment in the overall grade.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.assignments[name] = {'score': score, 'weight': weight}\n\n    def calculate_grade(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the student's overall grade.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The student's overall grade (out of 100).\n        \"\"\"\n        total_weight = sum(assignment['weight'] for assignment in self.assignments.values())\n        if total_weight != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Weights must add up to 1\")\n\n        total_score = sum(assignment['score'] * assignment['weight'] for assignment in self.assignments.values())\n        return total_score\n\n\ndef main():\n    student_name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n    student = Student(student_name)\n\n    num_assignments = int(input(\"Enter number of assignments: \"))\n\n    for i in range(num_assignments):\n        assignment_name = input(f\"Enter name of assignment {i+1}: \")\n        score = float(input(f\"Enter score for assignment {i+1} (out of 100): \"))\n        weight = float(input(f\"Enter weight of assignment {i+1} (out of 1): \"))\n        student.add_assignment(assignment_name, score, weight)\n\n    grade = student.calculate_grade()\n    print(f\"{student_name}'s overall grade is: {grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the student's name.\n2. Enter the number of assignments.\n3. For each assignment, enter the name, score, and weight.\n4. The program will calculate and display the student's overall grade.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `Student` class stores the student's name and assignments in a dictionary.\n* The `add_assignment` method adds an assignment to the student's record.\n* The `calculate_grade` method calculates the student's overall grade as a weighted average of the scores.\n* The `main` function prompts the user for input and displays the student's overall grade.\n* The program assumes that the weights add up to 1. If they do not, it raises a `ValueError`.",
