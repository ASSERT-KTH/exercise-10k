  "answer": "**Towers of Hanoi Problem Solution**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nThe Towers of Hanoi problem is a classic mathematical puzzle where we have three pegs and a stack of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any peg. The objective is to move the entire stack to another peg, subject to the following constraints:\n\n* Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n* A disk can only be moved from the top of one peg to the top of another peg.\n* A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem can be solved recursively. Here is a Python implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\ndef towers_of_hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of disks.\n        from_peg (str): The peg where the disks are initially located.\n        to_peg (str): The peg where the disks need to be moved.\n        aux_peg (str): The auxiliary peg.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        # Base case: move one disk from the from_peg to the to_peg.\n        print(f\"Move disk 1 from {from_peg} to {to_peg}\")\n        return\n\n    # Move n-1 disks from the from_peg to the aux_peg.\n    towers_of_hanoi(n - 1, from_peg, aux_peg, to_peg)\n\n    # Move the nth disk from the from_peg to the to_peg.\n    print(f\"Move disk {n} from {from_peg} to {to_peg}\")\n\n    # Move the n-1 disks from the aux_peg to the to_peg.\n    towers_of_hanoi(n - 1, aux_peg, to_peg, from_peg)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    n = 3  # Number of disks.\n    from_peg = \"A\"\n    to_peg = \"C\"\n    aux_peg = \"B\"\n\n    print(\"Towers of Hanoi solution:\")\n    towers_of_hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `towers_of_hanoi` function takes four arguments:\n\n* `n`: the number of disks.\n* `from_peg`: the peg where the disks are initially located.\n* `to_peg`: the peg where the disks need to be moved.\n* `aux_peg`: the auxiliary peg.\n\nThe function uses recursion to solve the problem. The base case is when there is only one disk to move, in which case it simply prints the move.\n\nFor `n` disks, the function:\n\n1. Moves `n-1` disks from the `from_peg` to the `aux_peg`.\n2. Moves the `nth` disk from the `from_peg` to the `to_peg`.\n3. Moves the `n-1` disks from the `aux_peg` to the `to_peg`.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `towers_of_hanoi` function with an example usage.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi problem is O(2^n), where n is the number of disks. This is because each recursive call branches into two more calls, resulting in an exponential number of moves.",
