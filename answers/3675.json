  "answer": "**Maximum of Three Numbers Function**\n\n### Description\nThis function takes three numbers as input and returns the maximum of the three.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef maximum_of_three(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the maximum of three numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (float): The first number.\n    b (float): The second number.\n    c (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The maximum of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return max(a, b, c)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 10.5\n    num2 = 20.2\n    num3 = 30.8\n    max_num = maximum_of_three(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The maximum of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {max_num}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `maximum_of_three` function takes three floating-point numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.\n*   It uses the built-in `max` function in Python to find the maximum of the three numbers.\n*   The function returns the maximum number.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the `maximum_of_three` function with three numbers and print the result.",
