  "answer": "**Cylinder Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is `V = \u03c0r\u00b2h`, where `V` is the volume, `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, `r` is the radius, and `h` is the height.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cylinder: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cylinder: \"))\n\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cylinder is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the cylinder when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n3. Enter the height of the cylinder when prompted (e.g., `10`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the volume of the cylinder (e.g., `785.40` cubic units).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `math` module to access the value of `\u03c0`.\n* The `calculate_cylinder_volume` function takes the radius and height as input, calculates the volume using the formula `V = \u03c0r\u00b2h`, and returns the result.\n* The `main` function gets the radius and height from the user, calls the `calculate_cylinder_volume` function, and prints the result.\n* The program includes error handling to ensure that the radius and height are non-negative.",
