  "answer": "### Creating a Binary Tree from a List of Nodes\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function creates a binary tree from a list of nodes. This function assumes that the input list contains node values in level order traversal, i.e., from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n#### Code Implementation\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in a binary tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef create_binary_tree(nodes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a binary tree from a list of nodes.\n\n    Args:\n    nodes (list): A list of node values in level order traversal.\n\n    Returns:\n    TreeNode: The root node of the created binary tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nodes:\n        return None\n\n    root = TreeNode(nodes[0])\n    queue = [root]\n    i = 1\n\n    while i < len(nodes):\n        current_node = queue.pop(0)\n        \n        # Create left child\n        if i < len(nodes):\n            current_node.left = TreeNode(nodes[i])\n            queue.append(current_node.left)\n            i += 1\n        \n        # Create right child\n        if i < len(nodes):\n            current_node.right = TreeNode(nodes[i])\n            queue.append(current_node.right)\n            i += 1\n\n    return root\n\n# Example usage:\ndef print_tree(node, level=0):\n    \"\"\"Prints the binary tree in a pretty format.\"\"\"\n    if node is not None:\n        print_tree(node.right, level + 1)\n        print(' ' * 4 * level + '->', node.value)\n        print_tree(node.left, level + 1)\n\n# Create a binary tree from a list of nodes\nnodes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nroot = create_binary_tree(nodes)\n\n# Print the binary tree\nprint_tree(root)\n```\n#### Explanation\n\n*   We define a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in the binary tree.\n*   The `create_binary_tree` function takes a list of node values as input and returns the root node of the created binary tree.\n*   We use a queue to keep track of nodes at each level and create left and right children for each node.\n*   The `print_tree` function is used to print the binary tree in a pretty format.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the `create_binary_tree` function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the input list, since we process each node once.\n\n#### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the `create_binary_tree` function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the input list, since we store all nodes in the binary tree. The queue used to store nodes at each level has a maximum size of n/2, which simplifies to O(n).",
