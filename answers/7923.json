  "answer": "**Calculating the Area of a Triangle**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height using the formula: `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n    base (float): The base of the triangle.\n    height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers\")\n    area = (base * height) / 2\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    base = 5.0\n    height = 6.0\n    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n    print(f\"The area of the triangle with base {base} and height {height} is: {area}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two arguments: `base` and `height`, both of type `float`.\n2. It checks if both `base` and `height` are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_triangle_area` function with example values for `base` and `height`.\n5. The program prints the calculated area to the console.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `triangle_area.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python triangle_area.py`). The program will output the calculated area for the given example values. You can modify the `base` and `height` variables in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
