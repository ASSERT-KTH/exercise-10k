  "answer": "### Character Classification\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that creates a string, classifies each character as a letter, digit, or special character, and then prints out the classified characters.\n\n```python\ndef classify_characters(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify each character in the input string as a letter, digit, or special character.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to be classified.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            print(f\"{char} is a letter.\")\n        elif char.isdigit():\n            print(f\"{char} is a digit.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{char} is a special character.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a sample string\n    sample_string = \"Hello, World! 123\"\n\n    print(\"Character Classification:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n    classify_characters(sample_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `classify_characters` function iterates over each character in the input string.\n*   It uses the `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` methods to check if the character is a letter or a digit, respectively.\n*   If the character is neither a letter nor a digit, it is classified as a special character.\n*   The classified characters are printed to the console.\n*   In the `main` function, a sample string is created, and the `classify_characters` function is called with this string.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the classification of each character in the sample string. The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nCharacter Classification:\n---------------------------\nH is a letter.\ne is a letter.\nl is a letter.\nl is a letter.\no is a letter.\n, is a special character.\n  is a special character.\nW is a letter.\no is a letter.\nr is a letter.\nl is a letter.\nd is a letter.\n! is a special character.\n  is a special character.\n1 is a digit.\n2 is a digit.\n3 is a digit.\n```",
