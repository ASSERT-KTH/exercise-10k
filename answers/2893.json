  "prompt": "Write a program to compare two fractions and determine which one is larger.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem. This program defines a class `Fraction` to represent fractions, with methods to compare them:\n\n```python\nclass Fraction:\n    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Fraction object.\n\n        Args:\n            numerator (int): The numerator of the fraction.\n            denominator (int): The denominator of the fraction.\n\n        Raises:\n            ZeroDivisionError: If the denominator is zero.\n        \"\"\"\n        if denominator == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Denominator cannot be zero\")\n        self.numerator = numerator\n        self.denominator = denominator\n\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compare this fraction with another fraction.\n\n        Args:\n            other (Fraction): The other fraction to compare with.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if this fraction is less than the other, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.numerator * other.denominator < other.numerator * self.denominator\n\n    def __gt__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compare this fraction with another fraction.\n\n        Args:\n            other (Fraction): The other fraction to compare with.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if this fraction is greater than the other, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.numerator * other.denominator > other.numerator * self.denominator\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compare this fraction with another fraction for equality.\n\n        Args:\n            other (Fraction): The other fraction to compare with.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if this fraction is equal to the other, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.numerator * other.denominator == other.numerator * self.denominator\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a string representation of the fraction.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: A string representation of the fraction.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"{self.numerator}/{self.denominator}\"\n\n\ndef compare_fractions(fraction1, fraction2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compare two fractions and determine which one is larger.\n\n    Args:\n        fraction1 (Fraction): The first fraction to compare.\n        fraction2 (Fraction): The second fraction to compare.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string indicating which fraction is larger.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fraction1 > fraction2:\n        return f\"{fraction1} is larger than {fraction2}\"\n    elif fraction1 < fraction2:\n        return f\"{fraction1} is smaller than {fraction2}\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{fraction1} is equal to {fraction2}\"\n\n\n# Example usage\nfraction1 = Fraction(1, 2)\nfraction2 = Fraction(1, 3)\n\nprint(compare_fractions(fraction1, fraction2))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a `Fraction` class to represent fractions with a numerator and a denominator.\n*   The `__lt__`, `__gt__`, and `__eq__` methods are used to compare fractions.\n*   The `compare_fractions` function takes two `Fraction` objects as input and returns a string indicating which fraction is larger.\n*   In the example usage, we create two `Fraction` objects and compare them using the `compare_fractions` function.",
