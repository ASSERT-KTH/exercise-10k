  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on the input number. The pattern should be a square of asterisks with the size of the input number. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be a 5x5 square of asterisks.",

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
