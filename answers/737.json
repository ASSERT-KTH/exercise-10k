  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a time in seconds as input and outputs its equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef convert_time(seconds):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts time in seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n    Args:\n        seconds (int): Time in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing hours, minutes, and seconds.\n    \"\"\"\n    hours = seconds // 3600\n    minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60\n    seconds = seconds % 60\n    return hours, minutes, seconds\n\ndef main():\n    # Get input from user\n    seconds = int(input(\"Enter time in seconds: \"))\n\n    # Convert time\n    hours, minutes, seconds = convert_time(seconds)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"{hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, {seconds} seconds\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `convert_time` function takes the input time in seconds and calculates the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n2. The `//` operator is used for integer division (i.e., rounding down to the nearest whole number), and the `%` operator is used to get the remainder.\n3. The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `convert_time` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `3661` seconds\n  Output: `1 hours, 1 minutes, 1 seconds`\n* Input: `7200` seconds\n  Output: `2 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds`\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to input a non-negative integer for the time in seconds.\n* You can modify the program to handle invalid inputs by adding error checking code.",
