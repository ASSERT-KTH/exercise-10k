  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their division result and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division result and remainder.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the division result and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    \n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    \n    # Divide the numbers and get the result and remainder\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two integers as input and returns a tuple containing the division result and remainder. The `main` function gets the numbers from the user, calls `divide_numbers`, and prints the result. It also handles the case where the user tries to divide by zero, which would normally cause an error.",
