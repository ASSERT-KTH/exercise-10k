  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following function uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence of two input strings.\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common subsequence of two input strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common subsequence of str1 and str2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * (len(str2) + 1) for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming\n    for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = len(str1), len(str2)\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    # Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order\n    return \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"AGGTAB\"\nstr2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\nprint(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: \"GTAB\"\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Create a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences.\n2.  Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming:\n\n    *   If the current characters in `str1` and `str2` match, the length of the common subsequence is one more than the length of the common subsequence without these characters.\n    *   If the characters do not match, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum length of the common subsequences without the current character in either `str1` or `str2`.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array by tracing back the path from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order by reversing the reconstructed subsequence.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. The space complexity is also O(m \\* n) for the 2D array.",
