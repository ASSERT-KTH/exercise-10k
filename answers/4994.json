  "answer": "Variable Shadowing\n=====================\n\nVariable shadowing is a concept in programming where a variable with the same name is declared in a nested scope, effectively hiding or \"shadowing\" the variable in the outer scope.\n\nExample in Python\n-----------------\n\n```python\n# Outer scope\nx = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Inner scope\n    x = 20  # This variable shadows the outer scope variable x\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Innermost scope\n        print(\"Innermost scope:\", x)  # Prints 20\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Inner scope:\", x)  # Prints 20\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Outer scope:\", x)  # Prints 10\n```\n\nIn this example, the variable `x` is declared in the outer scope with the value `10`. Inside the `outer_function`, another variable `x` is declared with the value `20`, which shadows the outer scope variable `x`. The `inner_function` can only access the `x` variable in the inner scope, which is `20`. After the `outer_function` is called, the outer scope variable `x` remains unchanged, still holding the value `10`.\n\nKey Points\n------------\n\n*   Variable shadowing can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.\n*   It's essential to use unique variable names or access outer scope variables explicitly to avoid confusion.\n*   The scope of a variable determines its accessibility and lifetime.\n\nBest Practices\n--------------\n\n*   Avoid using variable shadowing unless necessary, as it can make code harder to understand and maintain.\n*   Use meaningful variable names to minimize the risk of naming conflicts.\n*   Consider using scope resolution operators or explicit scope references to access outer scope variables.",
