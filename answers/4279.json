  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a dictionary and a key as input and returns True if the key is not present in the dictionary and False otherwise using the not in operator",
  "answer": "Here is a Python function that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef key_not_in_dict(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a key is not present in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to check.\n        key: The key to look for.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the key is not present in the dictionary, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return key not in dictionary\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\nprint(key_not_in_dict(my_dict, \"d\"))  # Output: True\nprint(key_not_in_dict(my_dict, \"a\"))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis function uses the `not in` operator to check if the key is not present in the dictionary. The `not in` operator returns `True` if the key is not found in the dictionary and `False` otherwise. This function is concise and readable, and it includes a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return value. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample dictionary and keys.",
