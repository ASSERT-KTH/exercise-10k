  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their choice and returns it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\"\"\"\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"].\n2. The `get_user_choice` function asks the user for their choice and validates it to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n3. The `determine_winner` function uses conditional statements to determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\n4. The `play_game` function orchestrates the game by getting the user's and computer's choices, determining the winner, and printing the results.\n5. The `main` function allows the user to play the game repeatedly by asking if they want to play again after each round.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (e.g., \"rock\") when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and the result of the game.\n4. You can play again by entering \"yes\" when asked if you want to play again.",
