  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and replaces all consonants with a specified character.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef replace_consonants(input_str, replacement_char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replaces all consonants in the input string with the specified replacement character.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string.\n        replacement_char (str): The character to replace consonants with.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The modified string with consonants replaced.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the set of vowels\n    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n\n    # Use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string\n    # If the character is a letter and not a vowel, replace it with the replacement character\n    # Otherwise, keep the original character\n    modified_str = ''.join(\n        [char if not char.isalpha() or char in vowels else replacement_char for char in input_str]\n    )\n\n    return modified_str\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_str = \"Hello, World!\"\nreplacement_char = '*'\nprint(replace_consonants(input_str, replacement_char))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n*   It defines a function `replace_consonants` that takes two parameters: the input string and the replacement character.\n*   Inside the function, it defines a set of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).\n*   It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string.\n*   For each character, it checks if the character is a letter and not a vowel. If so, it replaces the character with the replacement character. Otherwise, it keeps the original character.\n*   Finally, it joins the modified characters back into a string and returns the result.\n\nWhen you run this program with the example input string \"Hello, World!\" and the replacement character '*', it will output the modified string where all consonants have been replaced with '*'.",
