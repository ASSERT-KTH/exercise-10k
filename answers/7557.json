  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name as input and prints out a greeting message, with a default greeting if no name is provided.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a greeting message based on the input provided, including a default greeting when no input is given. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a greeting message with the provided name.\n    \n    If no name is provided, it will use a default greeting.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str, optional): The name to be used in the greeting. Defaults to None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the name is None, which means no name was provided\n    if name is None:\n        # If no name is provided, we use a default greeting\n        greeting_message = \"Hello, World!\"\n    else:\n        # If a name is provided, we use it in the greeting message\n        greeting_message = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Finally, we print out the greeting message\n    print(greeting_message)\n\n# Test the function with a name\nprint_greeting(\"John\")\n\n# Test the function without a name\nprint_greeting()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_greeting` takes an optional `name` parameter, which defaults to `None` if not provided. This allows for both personalized and default greetings.\n* Inside the function, a conditional check is performed to determine whether a `name` has been provided. If `name` is `None`, a default greeting is used; otherwise, the provided `name` is incorporated into the greeting message.\n* The greeting message, whether default or personalized, is stored in the `greeting_message` variable and then printed out using the `print` function.\n* Example usage of the function is demonstrated with and without providing a `name` to showcase both scenarios.",
