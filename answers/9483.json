  "answer": "**User Information Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite color, then prints out a greeting message with the provided information.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user information from input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    favorite_color = input(\"Please enter your favorite color: \")\n    return name, age, favorite_color\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age, favorite_color):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message with user information.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and your favorite color is {favorite_color}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main program function.\"\"\"\n    name, age, favorite_color = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age, favorite_color)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite color.\n2. The `print_greeting` function prints out a greeting message with the provided user information.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_greeting` to print the greeting message.\n4. The program uses a `try-except` block to ensure that the user enters a valid age.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name, age, and favorite color. After entering the information, it will print out a greeting message with the provided details.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nPlease enter your favorite color: blue\nHello, John! You are 30 years old and your favorite color is blue.\n```",
