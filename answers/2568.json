  "answer": "### Prime Number Checker Program\n#### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using a for loop. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers (i.e., `n % i == 0`), it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number (e.g., 23) to see the program confirm that it is prime.\n* Enter a non-prime number (e.g., 30) to see the program confirm that it is not prime.\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1 (e.g., 1, 0, -1) to see the program confirm that it is not prime.",
