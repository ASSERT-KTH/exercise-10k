  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   If `n` is a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   If `n` is 0, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is 1.\n*   For any other positive number `n`, it calculates the factorial using a `for` loop that multiplies all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result.\n*   In the example usage, the program asks the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using the `factorial` function, and prints the result.",
