  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations using floating-point numbers:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two floating-point numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two floating-point numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two floating-point numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two floating-point numbers.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Operations:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \"))\n\n    if choice == 1:\n        result = add(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif choice == 2:\n        result = subtract(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif choice == 3:\n        result = multiply(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif choice == 4:\n        try:\n            result = divide(num1, num2)\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n        except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n            print(e)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The program defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to input two floating-point numbers and choose an operation.\n*   Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding arithmetic function and prints the result.\n*   For division, the program checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Run the program and enter two numbers, such as 10.5 and 2.5.\n*   Choose an operation, such as addition (1).\n*   The program will print the result, which in this case would be `10.5 + 2.5 = 13.0`.",
