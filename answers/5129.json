  "answer": "**Finding the Missing Number in an Array of Consecutive Integers**\n\nThe following program uses a mathematical approach to find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers. The idea is to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and subtract the sum of the numbers in the array.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of consecutive integers with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums) + 1  # The total number of integers in the sequence\n    max_num = max(nums)  # The maximum number in the array\n    min_num = min(nums)  # The minimum number in the array\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    total_sum = (n * (min_num + max_num)) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array\n    array_sum = sum(nums)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the array sum\n    missing_number = total_sum - array_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(nums)\n    print(f\"The missing number in the array is: {missing_number}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Calculate the total number of integers in the sequence (`n`).\n2.  Find the maximum and minimum numbers in the array.\n3.  Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (min_num + max_num) / 2`.\n4.  Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array using the built-in `sum()` function.\n5.  The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the array sum.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we need to iterate over the array to find the maximum and minimum numbers and to calculate the sum of the numbers in the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. We only use a few variables to store the total sum, array sum, and missing number, regardless of the size of the input array.",
