  "prompt": "Create a program to determine whether a person is eligible for a job based on their age, experience, and qualifications. If the person's age is above 18, experience is above 2 years, and qualifications are relevant, they are eligible.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that determines whether a person is eligible for a job based on their age, experience, and qualifications.\n\n```python\nclass JobEligibility:\n    def __init__(self, age, experience, qualifications):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the job eligibility criteria.\n\n        Args:\n            age (int): The age of the person.\n            experience (int): The experience of the person in years.\n            qualifications (list): A list of relevant qualifications.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.age = age\n        self.experience = experience\n        self.qualifications = qualifications\n\n    def is_eligible(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Determine whether the person is eligible for the job.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the person is eligible, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if the person's age is above 18\n        age_eligible = self.age >= 18\n\n        # Check if the person's experience is above 2 years\n        experience_eligible = self.experience > 2\n\n        # Check if the person has relevant qualifications\n        qualifications_eligible = len(self.qualifications) > 0\n\n        # The person is eligible if all criteria are met\n        return age_eligible and experience_eligible and qualifications_eligible\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    age = 25\n    experience = 5\n    qualifications = [\"Bachelor's degree\", \"Master's degree\"]\n\n    eligibility = JobEligibility(age, experience, qualifications)\n\n    if eligibility.is_eligible():\n        print(f\"A person with age {age}, experience {experience} years, and qualifications {qualifications} is eligible for the job.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"A person with age {age}, experience {experience} years, and qualifications {qualifications} is not eligible for the job.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a class `JobEligibility` to encapsulate the eligibility criteria.\n2. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the person's age, experience, and qualifications.\n3. The `is_eligible` method checks if the person meets all the eligibility criteria (age above 18, experience above 2 years, and relevant qualifications).\n4. In the `main` function, we create an instance of `JobEligibility` with example values and check if the person is eligible for the job.\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the `JobEligibility` class to include additional eligibility criteria as needed.\n* You can also add more methods to the class to perform other related tasks, such as calculating the person's salary or benefits based on their experience and qualifications.\n* Make sure to handle edge cases and invalid inputs, such as negative ages or experiences, to ensure the program works correctly in all scenarios.",
