  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns a new function with access to the outer function's scope. This concept is known as a closure in programming. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining the outer function.\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns a new function that has access to the outer function's scope.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A new function with access to the outer function's scope.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We define a variable in the outer function's scope.\n    outer_variable = \"I'm in the outer function's scope\"\n    \n    # We define the inner function. This function will have access to the outer function's scope.\n    def inner_function():\n        # We can access the outer function's variable from within the inner function.\n        print(outer_variable)\n        \n    # We return the inner function. This allows the inner function to be used outside of the outer function.\n    return inner_function\n\n# We call the outer function to get the inner function.\ninner_func = outer_function()\n\n# We call the inner function to demonstrate that it has access to the outer function's scope.\ninner_func()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We define the `outer_function` which contains a variable `outer_variable` and returns the `inner_function`. This allows `inner_function` to access `outer_variable` even after `outer_function` has finished executing.\n* The `inner_function` is defined inside `outer_function` and can access `outer_variable`, demonstrating that it has access to the outer function's scope.\n* We call `outer_function` to get the `inner_function` and store it in `inner_func`. This allows us to use `inner_func` outside of `outer_function`.\n* Finally, we call `inner_func` to demonstrate that it can still access `outer_variable`, even though `outer_function` has finished executing.",
