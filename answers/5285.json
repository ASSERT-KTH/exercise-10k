  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to count the frequency of each word in a given text.\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_word_frequency(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each word in a given text.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input text.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Convert the text to lower case to ensure the word count is case-insensitive\n    text = text.lower()\n\n    # Replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces\n    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', ' ', text)\n\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Initialize an empty Counter object to store the word frequencies\n    word_frequency = Counter()\n\n    # Use a for loop to iterate over the words and update the word frequency\n    for word in words:\n        word_frequency[word] += 1\n\n    return word_frequency\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input text from the user\n    text = input(\"Enter a text: \")\n\n    # Count the word frequency\n    word_frequency = count_word_frequency(text)\n\n    # Print the word frequency\n    print(\"Word Frequency:\")\n    for word, frequency in word_frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{word}: {frequency}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1.  We first import the required libraries: `re` for regular expressions and `Counter` from `collections` to store the word frequencies.\n2.  We define a function `count_word_frequency` that takes the input text, converts it to lower case, replaces non-alphanumeric characters with spaces, splits the text into words, and uses a `Counter` object to store the word frequencies.\n3.  We use a for loop to iterate over the words and update the word frequency in the `Counter` object.\n4.  In the `main` function, we get the input text from the user, count the word frequency using the `count_word_frequency` function, and print the word frequency.\n5.  Finally, we call the `main` function when the program is run directly.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `word_frequency.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python word_frequency.py`). When prompted, enter a text, and the program will display the word frequency.",
