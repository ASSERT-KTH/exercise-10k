  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the reversed string. The program should handle strings of varying lengths and containing different characters, including spaces and punctuation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef reverse_strings(string):\n    reversed_string = \"\"\n    for char in string:\n        reversed_string = char + reversed_string\n    return reversed_string\n\nprint(reverse_strings(\"Hello world!\"))\n```\nThis code defines a function `reverse_strings` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input string, and for each character, it adds the character to the beginning of the `reversed_string` variable. Finally, the function returns the fully constructed `reversed_string`.\n\nThe code then calls the `reverse_strings` function with the argument `\"Hello world!\"` and prints the result.",
