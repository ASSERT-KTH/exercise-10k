  "prompt": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence between 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA' is 'BCBA' with a length of 4.",
  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Problem**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D table where each cell `[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first `i` characters of the first sequence and the first `j` characters of the second sequence.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.\n\n    Args:\n        seq1 (str): The first sequence.\n        seq2 (str): The second sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m, n = len(seq1), len(seq2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Example usage\nseq1 = \"ABCBDAB\"\nseq2 = \"BDCABA\"\nprint(\"Length of longest common subsequence:\", longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Create a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two sequences.\n2.  Initialize all cells in the table to 0.\n3.  Iterate through each cell in the table. If the current characters in the two sequences match, update the cell value to the value of the top-left diagonal cell plus 1.\n4.  If the characters do not match, update the cell value to the maximum of the values in the cell above and the cell to the left.\n5.  The value in the bottom-right cell of the table represents the length of the longest common subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the two sequences.\n*   The space complexity is also O(m \\* n) for the 2D table.",
