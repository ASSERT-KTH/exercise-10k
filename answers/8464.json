  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x1, y1).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The program uses the `math` module for the `sqrt` function.\n2. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples as input, each representing the coordinates of a point in the 2D plane.\n3. The function calculates the distance using the Euclidean distance formula: `\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n5. The distance is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Program\nSave this code in a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). The program will output the distance between the example points. You can modify the `main` function to test the `calculate_distance` function with different points.",
