  "prompt": "Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `main` function contains the primary code execution.\n- The `print` function is used to output 'Hello, World!' to the console.\n- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line checks if this script is being run directly (not imported), and if so, calls the `main` function.\n\n### Running the Program\n1. Save the above code in a file named `hello.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `hello.py`.\n3. Run the program with the command `python hello.py`.\n4. 'Hello, World!' will be printed to the console.",
