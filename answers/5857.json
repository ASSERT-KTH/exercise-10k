  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a student's name and grade, and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the grade is A, print 'Excellent'; if the grade is B, print 'Good'; if the grade is C, print 'Fair'; if the grade is D or F, print 'Needs improvement'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the given grade and returns a corresponding message.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    grade (str): The student's grade.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: A message based on the grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade.upper() == 'A':\n        return 'Excellent'\n    elif grade.upper() == 'B':\n        return 'Good'\n    elif grade.upper() == 'C':\n        return 'Fair'\n    elif grade.upper() in ['D', 'F']:\n        return 'Needs improvement'\n    else:\n        return 'Invalid grade'\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the student's name\n    name = input(\"Please enter the student's name: \")\n    \n    # Ask the user for the student's grade\n    grade = input(\"Please enter the student's grade (A, B, C, D, F): \")\n    \n    # Evaluate the grade and print the result\n    message = evaluate_grade(grade)\n    print(f\"{name}'s grade is {grade}. {message}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   The `evaluate_grade` function checks the given grade and returns a corresponding message.\n*   The `main` function asks the user for the student's name and grade, evaluates the grade using the `evaluate_grade` function, and then prints the result.\n*   The program handles invalid grades by returning an 'Invalid grade' message.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n*   Run the program.\n*   Enter the student's name when prompted (e.g., \"John Doe\").\n*   Enter the student's grade when prompted (e.g., \"A\").\n*   The program will print a message based on the grade (e.g., \"John Doe's grade is A. Excellent\").",
