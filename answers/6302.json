  "answer": "**Accessing a Dictionary Key in Python**\n=========================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that accesses a specific key in a dictionary and prints its corresponding value.\n\n```python\ndef access_dictionary_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Accesses a specific key in a dictionary and prints its corresponding value.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key (any): The key to access in the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Attempt to access the key in the dictionary\n        value = dictionary[key]\n        print(f\"The value for key '{key}' is: {value}\")\n    except KeyError:\n        # Handle the case where the key does not exist in the dictionary\n        print(f\"Key '{key}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample dictionary\n    sample_dict = {\n        \"name\": \"John\",\n        \"age\": 30,\n        \"city\": \"New York\"\n    }\n\n    # Access a key in the dictionary\n    access_dictionary_key(sample_dict, \"name\")\n    access_dictionary_key(sample_dict, \"age\")\n    access_dictionary_key(sample_dict, \"nonexistent_key\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `access_dictionary_key` function takes two arguments: `dictionary` and `key`.\n2. It attempts to access the `key` in the `dictionary` using the square bracket notation (`dictionary[key]`).\n3. If the `key` exists in the `dictionary`, it prints the corresponding value.\n4. If the `key` does not exist in the `dictionary`, it catches the `KeyError` exception and prints an error message.\n5. In the example usage, we create a sample dictionary and demonstrate how to access different keys using the `access_dictionary_key` function.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe value for key 'name' is: John\nThe value for key 'age' is: 30\nKey 'nonexistent_key' not found in the dictionary.\n```",
