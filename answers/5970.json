  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list as input, and returns a new list that is the reverse of the input list.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python solution that uses slicing to reverse the list:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list that is the reverse of the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be reversed.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list that is the reverse of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return input_list[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(reverse_list(input_list))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nThis program works by using Python's slice notation. The `[::-1]` slice means \"start at the end of the list and end at position 0, move with the step -1\" which effectively reverses the list.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the built-in `reversed` function in combination with the `list` function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(input_list):\n    return list(reversed(input_list))\n```\n\nBoth of these solutions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because they both create a new list that is the reverse of the input list.",
