  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate. The program should use the formula tax = income * rate to calculate the tax.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate.\n    \n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate the tax for.\n        rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The tax owed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the income and rate are valid\n    if income < 0 or rate < 0 or rate > 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input. Income and rate must be non-negative and rate must be between 0 and 1.\")\n\n    # Calculate the tax using the formula tax = income * rate\n    tax = income * rate\n\n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the income and tax rate from the user\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 25 for 25%): \"))\n\n    # Convert the tax rate from a percentage to a decimal\n    rate = rate / 100\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate the tax owed\n        tax = calculate_tax(income, rate)\n\n        # Print the tax owed\n        print(f\"Your tax owed is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program uses a function called `calculate_tax` to calculate the tax owed given the income and tax rate. The function takes two arguments, `income` and `rate`, and returns the tax owed. The tax is calculated using the formula `tax = income * rate`.\n\nThe `main` function gets the income and tax rate from the user, calculates the tax owed, and prints the result. The tax rate is converted from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter your income and tax rate when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter your income: 50000\nEnter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 25 for 25%): 25\nYour tax owed is: $12500.00\n```\n\nNote that the tax rate should be entered as a percentage (e.g., 25 for 25%). The program will convert the tax rate to a decimal automatically.",
