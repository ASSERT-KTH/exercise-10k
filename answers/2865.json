  "answer": "**Finding All Occurrences of a Substring in a String**\n=====================================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `find_substring`, takes two parameters: `string` (the main string to search in) and `substring` (the substring to search for). It returns a list of indices where the substring is found.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all occurrences of a given substring in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The main string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of indices where the substring is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = []\n    start = 0\n    while start < len(string):\n        idx = string.find(substring, start)\n        if idx != -1:\n            indices.append(idx)\n            start = idx + 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return indices\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, world. Hello again.\"\n    substring = \"Hello\"\n    indices = find_substring(string, substring)\n    print(f\"Substring '{substring}' found at indices: {indices}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `find_substring` initializes an empty list `indices` to store the indices of the found substrings.\n2. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string, starting from the beginning.\n3. Inside the loop, it uses the `find` method to search for the substring, starting from the current `start` index.\n4. If the substring is found, its index is appended to the `indices` list, and the `start` index is updated to the found index + 1 to continue searching from the next character.\n5. If the substring is not found, the loop breaks, and the function returns the list of indices.\n6. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `find_substring` with an example string and substring.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSubstring 'Hello' found at indices: [0, 13]\n```",
