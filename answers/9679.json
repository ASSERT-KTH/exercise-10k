  "prompt": "Write a program that asks for two strings and checks if the first string starts with the second string.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef check_start():\n    # Get two strings from the user\n    str1 = input(\"Enter the first string: \")\n    str2 = input(\"Enter the second string: \")\n\n    # Check if the first string starts with the second string\n    if str1.startswith(str2):\n        print(f'\"{str1}\" starts with \"{str2}\"')\n    else:\n        print(f'\"{str1}\" does not start with \"{str2}\"')\n\ncheck_start()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Get two strings from the user**: The program uses the built-in `input()` function to prompt the user to enter two strings, which are then stored in the `str1` and `str2` variables.\n2. **Check if the first string starts with the second string**: It uses the `startswith()` method, which returns `True` if the string starts with the specified value, otherwise `False`.\n3. **Print the result**: Depending on the result of the check, it prints a message indicating whether the first string starts with the second string.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n* If the user enters \"Hello World\" as the first string and \"Hello\" as the second string, the program will print: `\"Hello World\" starts with \"Hello\"`.\n* If the user enters \"Hello World\" as the first string and \"World\" as the second string, the program will print: `\"Hello World\" does not start with \"World\"`.",
