  "answer": "**Game Outcome Predictor**\n==========================\n\nThis program uses conditional statements to predict the outcome of a game based on the scores of the two teams.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef predict_game_outcome(team1_score, team2_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the outcome of a game based on the scores of the two teams.\n\n    Args:\n        team1_score (int): The score of the first team.\n        team2_score (int): The score of the second team.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The predicted outcome of the game.\n    \"\"\"\n    if team1_score > team2_score:\n        return \"Team 1 wins\"\n    elif team2_score > team1_score:\n        return \"Team 2 wins\"\n    else:\n        return \"It's a tie\"\n\ndef main():\n    team1_score = int(input(\"Enter the score of Team 1: \"))\n    team2_score = int(input(\"Enter the score of Team 2: \"))\n\n    outcome = predict_game_outcome(team1_score, team2_score)\n    print(\"The predicted outcome of the game is:\", outcome)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `predict_game_outcome` function takes two arguments: `team1_score` and `team2_score`.\n2. It uses conditional statements to compare the scores of the two teams.\n3. If `team1_score` is greater than `team2_score`, it returns \"Team 1 wins\".\n4. If `team2_score` is greater than `team1_score`, it returns \"Team 2 wins\".\n5. If the scores are equal, it returns \"It's a tie\".\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the scores of the two teams.\n7. It calls the `predict_game_outcome` function with the user-input scores and prints the predicted outcome.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* If Team 1 scores 10 points and Team 2 scores 5 points, the program will predict \"Team 1 wins\".\n* If Team 1 scores 5 points and Team 2 scores 10 points, the program will predict \"Team 2 wins\".\n* If both teams score 10 points, the program will predict \"It's a tie\".\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis is a simple program that assumes the game is won by the team with the highest score. In real-world scenarios, the outcome of a game may depend on various factors, such as the game's rules, the teams' strategies, and external factors like weather conditions.",
