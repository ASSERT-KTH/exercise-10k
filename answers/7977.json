  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate through the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n                # Set the flag to True to indicate a swap was made\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a list of numbers to be sorted\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n\n    # Print the original list\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n\n    # Sort the list using bubble sort\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n\n    # Print the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n--------------------\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list.\n2.  The outer loop iterates through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n3.  The inner loop iterates through the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element, comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n4.  If no swaps are made in the inner loop, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm terminates early.\n5.  The sorted list is returned as the result.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n----------------\n\nThe time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is:\n\n*   **Best-case**: O(n) when the input list is already sorted.\n*   **Average-case**: O(n^2) for random input lists.\n*   **Worst-case**: O(n^2) when the input list is in reverse order.\n\nNote that bubble sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its high time complexity. Other sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort are generally more efficient.",
