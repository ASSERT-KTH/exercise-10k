  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program checks whether a user-inputted number is prime or not. It uses a while loop to check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n\n    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number\n    i = 2\n    while i <= math.sqrt(num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Check if the number is prime\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a number when prompted (e.g., 25).\n3. The program will check whether the number is prime and print the result.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number.\n2. If the number is divisible by any of these values, it is not prime, and the function returns `False`.\n3. If the number is not divisible by any of these values, it is prime, and the function returns `True`.\n4. The `main` function gets user input, checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized numbers. For larger numbers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.",
