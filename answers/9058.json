  "answer": "**Day of the Week Program**\n====================================\n\nThis program takes an integer as input and prints out the corresponding day of the week.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef print_day_of_week(day_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the day of the week based on the given number.\n\n    Args:\n        day_number (int): The number of the day (1-7), where 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday.\n    \"\"\"\n    if day_number == 1:\n        print(\"Monday\")\n    elif day_number == 2:\n        print(\"Tuesday\")\n    elif day_number == 3:\n        print(\"Wednesday\")\n    elif day_number == 4:\n        print(\"Thursday\")\n    elif day_number == 5:\n        print(\"Friday\")\n    elif day_number == 6:\n        print(\"Saturday\")\n    elif day_number == 7:\n        print(\"Sunday\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\")\n\ndef main():\n    day_number = int(input(\"Enter the day number (1-7): \"))\n    print_day_of_week(day_number)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter `1` to print \"Monday\"\n* Enter `3` to print \"Wednesday\"\n* Enter `7` to print \"Sunday\"\n* Enter `8` to print \"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\"\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `print_day_of_week` function takes an integer `day_number` as input.\n2. The function uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to check the value of `day_number`.\n3. If `day_number` matches a value between 1 and 7, the corresponding day of the week is printed.\n4. If `day_number` is outside the range of 1-7, an error message is printed.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a day number, which is then passed to the `print_day_of_week` function.",
