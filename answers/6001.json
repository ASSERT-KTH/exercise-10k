  "answer": "**Hello World Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a simple program written in Python that prints \"Hello World\" to the screen.\n\n```python\ndef print_hello_world():\n    \"\"\"Prints Hello World to the screen.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello World\")\n\ndef main():\n    print_hello_world()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `print_hello_world` that contains a single statement to print \"Hello World\" to the console.\n*   The `main` function calls `print_hello_world` to execute the print statement.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1.  Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Type `python hello_world.py` to run the program.\n4.  You should see \"Hello World\" printed to the console.\n\nAlternatively, you can use an online Python compiler or IDE to run the program without saving it to a file.",
