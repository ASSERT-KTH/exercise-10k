  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses nested for loops to print out Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row:\n\n```python\ndef print_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.\n    \n    :param n: The number of rows to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to store each row of the triangle\n    triangle = [[1 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # Calculate each element of the triangle using the formula for Pascal's Triangle\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n    \n    # Print each row of the triangle\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(' ' * (n - len(row)), end='')  # Print leading spaces for alignment\n        for num in row:\n            print(f'{num} ', end='')\n        print()\n\n# Print Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row\nprint_pascals_triangle(5)\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `print_pascals_triangle` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of rows to print.\n2. We create a list `triangle` to store each row of the triangle. Each row is initialized with all ones, which is the base case for Pascal's Triangle.\n3. We calculate each element of the triangle using the formula `C(i, j) = C(i-1, j-1) + C(i-1, j)`, where `C(i, j)` is the element at row `i` and column `j`.\n4. We print each row of the triangle, using leading spaces for alignment.\n5. Finally, we call the `print_pascals_triangle` function with `n=5` to print Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row.",
