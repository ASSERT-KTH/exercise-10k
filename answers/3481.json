  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n# Get the numbers from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the sum\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `add_numbers` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`.\n2. **Function Body**: Inside the function, we simply return the sum of `a` and `b` using the `+` operator.\n3. **User Input**: We use the built-in `input` function to get two numbers from the user.\n4. **Function Call**: We call the `add_numbers` function with the user's input and store the result in the `result` variable.\n5. **Printing the Result**: Finally, we print the result to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter `2` and `3` when prompted. The program will output `The sum of 2.0 and 3.0 is 5.0`.\n* Run the program and enter `-1` and `4` when prompted. The program will output `The sum of -1.0 and 4.0 is 3.0`.",
