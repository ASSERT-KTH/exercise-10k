  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_integers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The given number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n    total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n\n    return total_sum\n\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n    try:\n        result = sum_of_integers(num)\n        print(f\"The sum of all integers from 1 to {num} is: {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `sum_of_integers(n)` that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. The `main()` function prompts the user to enter a positive integer, calls `sum_of_integers(n)` with the user's input, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `5`, the program will output `The sum of all integers from 1 to 5 is: 15`, because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`.\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will output `The sum of all integers from 1 to 10 is: 55`, because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55`.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple and efficient formula to calculate the sum, which makes it suitable for large inputs.\n* The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a positive integer. If the user enters an invalid input, the program will display an error message.",
