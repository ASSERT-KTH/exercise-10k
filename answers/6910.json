  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only prints the numbers that are divisible by 3. Use a for loop or a while loop to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "**Solution in Python**\n\n```python\n# Using a for loop\ndef print_numbers_divisible_by_3_for_loop():\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from 1 to 10 that are divisible by 3 using a for loop.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            print(i)\n\n# Using a while loop\ndef print_numbers_divisible_by_3_while_loop():\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from 1 to 10 that are divisible by 3 using a while loop.\"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i <= 10:\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            print(i)\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Numbers divisible by 3 using a for loop:\")\n    print_numbers_divisible_by_3_for_loop()\n    print(\"\\nNumbers divisible by 3 using a while loop:\")\n    print_numbers_divisible_by_3_while_loop()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n\n1. We define two functions: `print_numbers_divisible_by_3_for_loop` and `print_numbers_divisible_by_3_while_loop`.\n2. In the for loop function, we use `range(1, 11)` to generate numbers from 1 to 10.\n3. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is divisible by 3. If `i % 3 == 0`, we print the number.\n4. In the while loop function, we initialize a variable `i` to 1 and use a while loop to iterate until `i` is less than or equal to 10.\n5. We use the same modulo operator check as in the for loop function to print numbers divisible by 3.\n6. In the example usage section, we call both functions to demonstrate their output.\n\n**Output**\n\n```\nNumbers divisible by 3 using a for loop:\n3\n6\n9\n\nNumbers divisible by 3 using a while loop:\n3\n6\n9\n```",
