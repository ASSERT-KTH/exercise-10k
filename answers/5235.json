  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grades as input, and prints their GPA based on the following scale: A (4.0), B (3.0), C (2.0), D (1.0), F (0.0).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the GPA based on the given scale:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GPA based on the given grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades (A, B, C, D, F)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated GPA\n    \"\"\"\n    gpa_scale = {\n        'A': 4.0,\n        'B': 3.0,\n        'C': 2.0,\n        'D': 1.0,\n        'F': 0.0\n    }\n\n    total_points = 0\n    total_courses = 0\n\n    for grade in grades:\n        if grade.upper() in gpa_scale:\n            total_points += gpa_scale[grade.upper()]\n            total_courses += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Invalid grade: {grade}. Skipping...\")\n\n    if total_courses == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    return total_points / total_courses\n\n\ndef main():\n    num_courses = int(input(\"Enter the number of courses: \"))\n    grades = []\n\n    for i in range(num_courses):\n        grade = input(f\"Enter grade for course {i+1}: \")\n        grades.append(grade)\n\n    gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)\n\n    print(f\"GPA: {gpa:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of courses.\n3. Enter the grade for each course (A, B, C, D, F).\n4. The program will calculate and print the GPA.\n\nNote: This program assumes that all courses have the same weightage. If the courses have different weights, you would need to modify the program to take that into account.",
