  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the distance and speed as input and returns the time.",
  "answer": "**Time Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the time taken to cover a certain distance at a given speed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time(distance, speed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the time taken to cover a distance at a given speed.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance to be covered in kilometers.\n        speed (float): The speed at which the distance is covered in kilometers per hour.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The time taken to cover the distance in hours.\n    \"\"\"\n    if speed == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Speed cannot be zero\")\n    time = distance / speed\n    return time\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance in kilometers: \"))\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed in kilometers per hour: \"))\n\n    # Calculate time\n    try:\n        time = calculate_time(distance, speed)\n        print(f\"The time taken to cover {distance} km at {speed} km/h is {time} hours\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance in kilometers when prompted.\n3. Enter the speed in kilometers per hour when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the time taken to cover the distance at the given speed.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Distance: 100 km\n* Speed: 50 km/h\n* Time: 2 hours\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input values are valid and does not perform any error checking for non-numeric inputs. You may want to add additional error checking depending on your specific requirements.",
