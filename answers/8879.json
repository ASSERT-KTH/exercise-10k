  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the area\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_area` that takes `length` and `width` as arguments and returns the calculated area.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle using the `input` function.\n*   We then call the `calculate_area` function with the provided length and width, and store the result in the `area` variable.\n*   Finally, we print the calculated area to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nThe area of the rectangle is: 15.0\n```",
