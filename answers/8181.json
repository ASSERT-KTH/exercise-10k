  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_sum += i\n    return total_sum\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nresult = calculate_sum(n)\nprint(\"The sum of numbers from 1 to\", n, \"is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `calculate_sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. The `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), adding each number to the `total_sum` variable. The result is then printed out.\n\nYou can also use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, to calculate the sum in a more efficient way:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nresult = calculate_sum(n)\nprint(\"The sum of numbers from 1 to\", n, \"is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis version of the program is more efficient because it avoids the need for a loop and uses a simple mathematical formula to calculate the sum.",
