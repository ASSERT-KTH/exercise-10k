  "answer": "**Declaring a Constant Variable**\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\n# Declare a constant variable\nPI = 3.14159\n\n# Print the value of the constant variable\nprint(PI)\n```\n\nIn this example, `PI` is declared as a constant variable and assigned the value `3.14159`. Constant variables are typically written in uppercase to distinguish them from regular variables.\n\n**Best Practice:**\n\n* Constant variables should be declared at the top of the file or module.\n* Use uppercase letters with underscores to separate words (e.g., `CONSTANT_VARIABLE`).\n* Avoid reassigning values to constant variables.\n\n**Note:**\n\nPython does not have a built-in `const` keyword like some other programming languages. However, the convention of using uppercase letters and avoiding reassignment is widely adopted in the Python community to indicate that a variable is intended to be constant.",
