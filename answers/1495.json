  "answer": "**Printing Memory Address of a Variable**\n==========================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that prints the memory address of a variable.\n\n```python\ndef print_memory_address():\n    # Define a variable\n    var = 10\n    \n    # Print the memory address of the variable\n    print(\"Memory address of var:\", id(var))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_memory_address()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n---------------\n\n*   We define a function `print_memory_address` that creates a variable `var` with the value `10`.\n*   We use the built-in `id()` function in Python to get the memory address of the variable.\n*   The `id()` function returns a unique identifier for the object, which is its memory address.\n*   Finally, we print the memory address of the variable.\n\n**Note:**\n-----\n\n*   The `id()` function returns a unique identifier for the object, but it's not guaranteed to be the actual memory address. However, in CPython (the default Python implementation), it does return the memory address.\n*   The memory address may vary each time you run the program due to the dynamic nature of memory allocation.",
