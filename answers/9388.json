  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    while num2 != 0:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return abs(num1)\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\n    # Alternative method using math.gcd\n    gcd_math = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"Alternative method using math.gcd: {gcd_math}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `num1` and `num2` with `num2` and the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2` until `num2` becomes 0.\n3. The GCD is then returned as the absolute value of `num1`.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the GCD is calculated using the `calculate_gcd` function.\n5. The program also demonstrates an alternative method using the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18:\n\t+ Input: `num1 = 48`, `num2 = 18`\n\t+ Output: `The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6`\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30:\n\t+ Input: `num1 = 24`, `num2 = 30`\n\t+ Output: `The GCD of 24 and 30 is: 6`",
