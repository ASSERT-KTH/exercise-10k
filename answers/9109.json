  "prompt": "Create a program that defines a function to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. The function should take two numbers and an operator as arguments and return the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operator):\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Please use '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate` function takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator as arguments.\n*   It uses if-elif statements to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator.\n*   For division, it checks if the second number (`num2`) is not zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also includes error handling to catch and display any invalid operator or division by zero errors that may occur.",
