  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_array_sum(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all elements in the given array.\n    \n    Args:\n    array (list): The input array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of all elements in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum variable to 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for element in array:\n        total_sum += element  # Add the current element to the total sum\n    \n    return total_sum  # Return the calculated sum\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Sample array\n    print(\"Array:\", array)\n    print(\"Sum of array elements:\", calculate_array_sum(array))\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_array_sum` that takes an array as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to store the cumulative sum, starting with a value of 0.\n3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the array.\n4. Inside the loop, add the current element to the `total_sum`.\n5. After iterating through all elements, return the calculated `total_sum`.\n6. In the example usage, create a sample array and call the `calculate_array_sum` function to calculate and print the sum of its elements.\n\nYou can run this code with different arrays to calculate their sums.",
