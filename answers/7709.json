  "answer": "Anagram Detection\n================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nDetermine if two given strings are anagrams of each other, i.e., they contain the same characters in a different order.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem by sorting the characters in each string and comparing the results. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings are anagrams.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in each string and compare the results\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether they are anagrams.\n2.  The function first removes any whitespace from the strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3.  It then checks if the lengths of the strings are equal. If they are not, the function immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4.  Finally, the function sorts the characters in each string and compares the results. If the sorted strings are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the original strings are anagrams.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because the `sorted` function in Python uses the Timsort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because the `sorted` function creates new lists containing the sorted characters, which requires additional space proportional to the length of the strings.",
