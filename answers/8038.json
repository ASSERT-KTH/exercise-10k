  "answer": "**User Input Response Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses an if/else statement to respond to basic user input. It asks the user for their name and age, and then responds with a personalized message based on their age.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n    return name, age\n\ndef respond_to_input(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Respond to user input based on age\"\"\"\n    if age < 18:\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are still young and have your whole life ahead of you.\")\n    elif age < 65:\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are in the prime of your life. Enjoy every moment!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}! You have gained a lot of experience and wisdom. Keep shining!\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_input()\n    respond_to_input(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. User enters their name and age:\n   - Input: `John`, `25`\n   - Output: `Hello, John! You are in the prime of your life. Enjoy every moment!`\n\n2.

User enters their name and age as a senior:\n   - Input: `Bob`, `70`\n   - Output: `Hello, Bob! You have gained a lot of experience and wisdom. Keep shining!`\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `user_input_response.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python user_input_response.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter your name and age.\n5. The program will respond with a personalized message based on your age.",
