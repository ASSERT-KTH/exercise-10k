  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input. The input can be either an integer, float, or string. The program should then print out the data type of the input.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get user input\nuser_input = input()\n\n# Determine data type\ntry:\n    int(user_input)\n    print(\"This is an integer.\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    try:\n        float(user_input)\n        print(\"This is a float.\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"This is a string.\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, using a `try`-`except` block to attempt to convert the user's input to an integer and then to a float, and finally printing out the data type of the input based on whether the conversions were successful or not.",
