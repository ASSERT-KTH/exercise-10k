  "answer": "**Pascal's Triangle Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses nested loops to print Pascal's triangle.\n\n```python\ndef print_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints Pascal's triangle up to n rows.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first row of Pascal's triangle\n    triangle = [[1]]\n\n    # Generate each row of Pascal's triangle\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        row = [1]\n        # Calculate the middle elements of the current row\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            row.append(triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j])\n        row.append(1)\n        triangle.append(row)\n\n    # Print Pascal's triangle\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        print(\" \" * (n - i - 1), end=\"\")\n        # Print the current row\n        for num in triangle[i]:\n            print(num, end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 5  # Change this to print more or fewer rows\n    print_pascals_triangle(n)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `print_pascals_triangle` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of rows to print.\n2. The function initializes the first row of Pascal's triangle as a list containing a single element, `1`.\n3. The outer loop generates each row of Pascal's triangle, starting from the second row (index 1).\n4. The inner loop calculates the middle elements of the current row by summing the two elements directly above it in the previous row.\n5. The `row` list is appended to the `triangle` list, which stores all the rows of Pascal's triangle.\n6. Finally, the program prints Pascal's triangle by iterating over the rows and printing each element with leading spaces to maintain the triangle shape.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nFor `n = 5`, the program will output:\n```\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```",
