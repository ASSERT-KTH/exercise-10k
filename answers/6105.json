  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers and a target value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_index(array, target):\n    for i, element in enumerate(array):\n        if element == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 3\nprint(find_index(array, target))  # Output: 2\n```\nI've implemented the `find_index` function as described, using the `enumerate` function to iterate over the array and return the index of the first occurrence of the target value. If the target value is not found, the function returns -1.\n\nNote that I've also included an example usage of the function, where we define an array and a target value, and print the result of calling the `find_index` function with these values. The output is the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the array, which is 2 in this case.",
