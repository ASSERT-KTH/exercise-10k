  "prompt": "Write a function that composes two higher-order functions together, creating a new function that applies each higher-order function in sequence.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a new function that applies each higher-order function in sequence, addressing your question about composing two higher-order functions together. This solution will provide a clear, step-by-step approach to achieve the desired outcome. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compose(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Composes two higher-order functions together, creating a new function that applies each higher-order function in sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first higher-order function.\n        func2 (function): The second higher-order function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that applies func1 and then func2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We want to create a new function that takes an argument and applies func1 and then func2 to it\n    def composed_function(arg):\n        \n        # First, we apply func1 to the argument\n        intermediate_result = func1(arg)\n        \n        # Then, we apply func2 to the result of func1\n        final_result = func2(intermediate_result)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the final result\n        return final_result\n    \n    # We return the new composed function\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions double and add_one\ncomposed = compose(double, add_one)\n\n# Apply the composed function to the number 5\nresult = composed(5)\nprint(result)  # Outputs: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose` function takes two higher-order functions, `func1` and `func2`, as arguments and returns a new function, `composed_function`, which applies `func1` and then `func2` to its argument.\n* Within `composed_function`, the `intermediate_result` is obtained by applying `func1` to the argument, and then `final_result` is obtained by applying `func2` to `intermediate_result`.\n* The `composed_function` is then returned by `compose`, allowing for the creation of a new function that sequences the application of `func1` and `func2`.\n* In the example usage, `double` and `add_one` are composed together and applied to the number 5, demonstrating the sequential application of the two functions.",
