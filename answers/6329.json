  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array as input, calculates and returns its mean, median, and mode.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and mode of an input array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\ndef calculate_statistics(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): Input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and mode of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = np.mean(array)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = np.median(array)\n\n    # Calculate the mode\n    mode = stats.mode(array)[0][0]\n\n    return mean, median, mode\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n    mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(array)\n\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. We first import the required libraries: `numpy` for numerical operations and `scipy.stats` for calculating the mode.\n2. We define a function `calculate_statistics` that takes an array as input and calculates its mean, median, and mode using `np.mean`, `np.median`, and `stats.mode` respectively.\n3. In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `calculate_statistics` with an example array.\n4. Finally, we print the calculated mean, median, and mode.\n\n### Advice:\n\n* This program assumes that the input array is not empty and contains only numbers.\n* If the input array is empty, `np.mean` and `np.median` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, while `stats.mode` will raise a `ValueError`.\n* If the input array contains non-numeric values, `np.mean` and `np.median` will raise a `TypeError`, while `stats.mode` will raise a `TypeError` as well.\n* To handle these edge cases, you can add error checking code to ensure that the input array is valid before calculating the statistics.",
