  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that retrieves a value associated with a given key from a dictionary, handling cases where the key does not exist. This will ensure you have a clear understanding of how to implement this functionality in your code. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef retrieve_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n\n    If the key does not exist in the dictionary, it returns None.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key (any): The key to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the key if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The first argument must be a dictionary.\")\n\n    # Then, we try to get the value associated with the key\n    # The get method of the dictionary returns None if the key is not found\n    # This way, we avoid a KeyError that would be raised if we used dictionary[key]\n    value = dictionary.get(key)\n\n    # Finally, we return the value\n    return value\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(retrieve_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Outputs: John\nprint(retrieve_value(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Outputs: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `retrieve_value` first checks if the provided `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary using `isinstance(dictionary, dict)`. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n* It then uses the `get` method of the `dictionary` to retrieve the value associated with the given `key`. The `get` method returns `None` if the `key` is not found in the `dictionary`, avoiding a potential `KeyError`.\n* Finally, the function returns the retrieved `value`, which can be either the associated value if the `key` exists or `None` if it does not.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the `retrieve_value` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, showcasing both a successful retrieval and a case where the key does not exist.",
