Please enter a number.\")\n\n    print(f\"In a year, you will be {age + 1} years old.\")\n\ndef display_menu():\n    \"\"\"Display a menu for the user to choose from.\"\"\"\n    print(\"\\nMenu:\")\n    print(\"1. Get your name\")\n    print(\"2. Get your age\")\n    print(\"3. Exit\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        display_menu()\n        choice = input(\"What would you like to do? \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            get_user_name()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            get_user_age()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  The program will display a menu and ask you to choose an option.\n3.  Choose option 1 to enter your name and receive a greeting.\n4.  Choose option 2 to enter your age and see how old you will be in a year.\n5.  Choose option 3 to exit the program.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n----------------------\n\n*   You can add more options to the menu by modifying the `display_menu` function and adding more conditions to the `main` function.\n*   You can use a dictionary to map user choices to functions, making it easier to add or remove options.\n*   You can use a loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter a valid choice.\n*   You can add error handling to deal with unexpected user input or other potential issues.",
