  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime or not.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime or not.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so we return `False`.\n3. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`, so we use a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop, it is not prime, so we return `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so we return `True`.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.\n7. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23: The program will output \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 24: The program will output \"24 is not a prime number.\"\n* Enter a number less than 2, such as 1: The program will output \"1 is not a prime number.\"",
