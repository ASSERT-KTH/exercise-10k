  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `factorial(n)` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial.\n2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, the function returns 1, as the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.\n3. **For Loop**: For `n` greater than 0, the function initializes a variable `result` to 1 and uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, `result` is multiplied by the current number `i`.\n4. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, the function returns the calculated factorial `result`.\n5. **Test the Function**: The program prompts the user to enter a number, calls the `factorial(n)` function with the input number, and prints the calculated factorial.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `5`\nOutput: `The factorial of 5 is 120`\n* Input: `3`\nOutput: `The factorial of 3 is 6`\n* Input: `0`\nOutput: `The factorial of 0 is 1`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input number is a non-negative integer. If you want to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you'll need to add additional error checking and handling code.",
