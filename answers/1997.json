  "answer": "**Weight Conversion Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program takes a weight in pounds as input and converts it to kilograms using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef convert_weight(pounds):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts weight from pounds to kilograms.\n\n    Args:\n        pounds (float): Weight in pounds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Weight in kilograms.\n    \"\"\"\n    kilograms = pounds * 0.45359237\n\n    # Conditional statements to determine the unit of measurement\n    if pounds < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Weight cannot be negative.\")\n        return None\n    elif pounds == 0:\n        print(\"Weight is 0 pounds, which is equivalent to 0 kilograms.\")\n    elif pounds < 1:\n        print(f\"{pounds} pounds is equivalent to {kilograms} kilograms (approximately).\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{pounds} pounds is equivalent to {kilograms:.2f} kilograms (approximately).\")\n\n    return kilograms\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    pounds = float(input(\"Enter weight in pounds: \"))\n\n    # Convert weight\n    convert_weight(pounds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Positive weight**: Enter a positive weight in pounds, and the program will convert it to kilograms.\n   * Input: `10`\n   * Output: `10 pounds is equivalent to 4.54 kilograms (approximately).`\n2. **Zero weight**: Enter a weight of 0 pounds, and the program will display a message indicating that the weight is 0 kilograms.\n   * Input: `0`\n   * Output: `Weight is 0 pounds, which is equivalent to 0 kilograms.`\n3. **Negative weight**: Enter a negative weight in pounds, and the program will display an error message.\n   * Input: `-10`\n   * Output: `Error: Weight cannot be negative.`\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple conversion formula to convert weight from pounds to kilograms.\n* The program handles different cases using conditional statements, including negative weights and zero weight.\n* The `convert_weight` function returns the converted weight in kilograms, and the `main` function gets user input and calls the `convert_weight` function.",
