  "answer": "**Word Frequency Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the frequency of each word in a given string. It splits the string into words, counts the occurrences of each word, and returns the result as a dictionary.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef word_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each word in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lower case\n    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', input_string).lower()\n    \n    # Split the string into words\n    words = cleaned_string.split()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    frequency = Counter(words)\n    \n    return dict(frequency)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"This is a test string. The string is just a test.\"\n    print(word_frequency(input_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function first removes punctuation from the input string using regular expressions and converts it to lower case to ensure accurate counting.\n2. It then splits the cleaned string into words using the `split` method.\n3. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word.\n4. Finally, the function returns the word frequencies as a dictionary.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor the input string \"This is a test string. The string is just a test.\", the function will output:\n```python\n{'this': 1, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test': 2, 'string': 2, 'the': 1, 'just': 1}\n```",
