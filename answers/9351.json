  "answer": "### Student Information Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nBelow is an example of how to declare variables for a student's name and age, and then print out these values in Python:\n\n```python\n# Declare variables for student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the variable values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: We declare two variables, `student_name` and `student_age`, and assign them the values `\"John Doe\"` and `20`, respectively.\n2. **Printing Variable Values**: We use the `print()` function to output the values of `student_name` and `student_age`. The strings `\"Student Name:\"` and `\"Student Age:\"` are used to provide context for the output values.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the basic declaration and printing of variables in Python, which can be applied to various scenarios such as storing and displaying student information.",
