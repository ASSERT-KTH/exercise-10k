  "answer": "**Variance Function**\n=======================\n\nThe following is an example of a Python function that calculates the variance of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must contain at least two numbers.\")\n\n    return statistics.variance(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvariance = calculate_variance(numbers)\nprint(f\"The variance of the input list is: {variance}\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the `statistics.variance()` function from the Python Standard Library, which calculates the sample variance of a list of numbers.\n\n**Manual Implementation**\n------------------------\n\nIf you want to implement the variance calculation manually, you can use the following formula:\n\n`variance = \u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)^2 / (n - 1)`\n\nwhere `x_i` is each number in the list, `\u03bc` is the mean of the list, `n` is the number of elements in the list, and `\u03a3` denotes the sum of the squared differences.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_variance_manual(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers manually.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must contain at least two numbers.\")\n\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n    return variance\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvariance = calculate_variance_manual(numbers)\nprint(f\"The variance of the input list is: {variance}\")\n```\n\nNote that this manual implementation assumes a sample variance calculation, where the divisor is `n - 1`. If you want to calculate the population variance, you can use `n` as the divisor instead.",
