  "answer": "**Echo Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that repeats back to the user what they have typed, after they press enter.\n\n```python\ndef echo_program():\n    \"\"\"\n    Repeats back to the user what they have typed, after they press enter.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Type something (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        print(\"You typed: \", user_input)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    echo_program()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The program runs in an infinite loop until the user types 'quit'.\n2. Inside the loop, the program waits for the user to type something using the `input()` function.\n3. If the user types 'quit', the program prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop.\n4. Otherwise, the program prints back to the user what they have typed.\n\n**Example Usage**\n----------------\n\n```\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): Hello World!\nYou typed:  Hello World!\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): Foo Bar\nYou typed:  Foo Bar\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): quit\nGoodbye!\n```",
