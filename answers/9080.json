  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that simulates a quiz show. The program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score. If the score is above a certain threshold, the user wins the game.\n\n```python\n# Define the quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\",\n    \"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?\": \"William Shakespeare\"\n}\n\ndef quiz_game():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Ask the quiz questions\n    for question, answer in quiz_questions.items():\n        user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n            print(\"Correct answer!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer is {answer}.\\n\")\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    if score >= 3:\n        print(f\"Congratulations, you won the game with a score of {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you lost the game with a score of {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}. Better luck next time!\")\n\n# Run the quiz game\nquiz_game()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Define the quiz questions and answers**: The program starts by defining a dictionary `quiz_questions` where the keys are the quiz questions and the values are the corresponding answers.\n2. **Initialize the score**: The program initializes a variable `score` to keep track of the user's score.\n3. **Ask the quiz questions**: The program iterates through the `quiz_questions` dictionary and asks the user each question. The user's answer is compared to the correct answer using an `if` statement. If the user's answer matches the correct answer (case-insensitive), the score is incremented and a success message is printed. Otherwise, a failure message with the correct answer is printed.\n4. **Determine the winner**: After all questions have been asked, the program checks the user's score using an `if` statement. If the score is 3 or higher, the user is declared the winner and a success message is printed. Otherwise, a failure message with the score is printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and answer all questions correctly to win the game.\n* Run the program and answer some questions incorrectly to see the failure messages.\n* Modify the `quiz_questions` dictionary to add or remove questions and answers.\n* Modify the winning condition by changing the threshold score in the `if` statement.",
