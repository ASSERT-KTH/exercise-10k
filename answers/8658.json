  "answer": "### Calculating the Average of a List of Lists\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the average of all elements in a list of lists.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of all elements in a list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list containing lists of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of all elements in the list of lists.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list of lists is empty or contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the list of lists is empty\n    if not list_of_lists or not any(list_of_lists):\n        raise ValueError(\"The list of lists is empty.\")\n\n    # Flatten the list of lists\n    flattened_list = [num for sublist in list_of_lists for num in sublist]\n\n    # Check if the flattened list contains non-numeric values\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in flattened_list):\n        raise ValueError(\"The list of lists contains non-numeric values.\")\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = sum(flattened_list) / len(flattened_list)\n\n    return average\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(list_of_lists)\n        print(f\"The average is: {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  Check if the input list of lists is empty. If it is, raise a ValueError.\n2.  Flatten the list of lists into a single list using a list comprehension.\n3.  Check if the flattened list contains any non-numeric values. If it does, raise a ValueError.\n4.  Calculate the average by summing up all the numbers in the flattened list and dividing by the total count of numbers.\n5.  Return the calculated average.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculating the average score of students in different classes.\n*   Finding the average value of a list of lists containing numeric data.\n*   Computing the average of a list of lists in a scientific or engineering application.",
