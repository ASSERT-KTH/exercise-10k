  "answer": "### Float Variable Operations\n\nBelow is an example of Python code that declares two float variables, calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient, and prints the results.\n\n```python\n# Declare two float variables\nnum1 = 10.5\nnum2 = 20.5\n\n# Calculate and print the sum\nsum_result = num1 + num2\nprint(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}\")\n\n# Calculate and print the difference\ndifference_result = num1 - num2\nprint(f\"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is: {difference_result}\")\n\n# Calculate and print the product\nproduct_result = num1 * num2\nprint(f\"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {product_result}\")\n\n# Calculate and print the quotient\nif num2 != 0:\n    quotient_result = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is: {quotient_result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: We declare two float variables, `num1` and `num2`, with the values `10.5` and `20.5`, respectively.\n2. **Operations**: We calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the variables using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, respectively.\n3. **Result Printing**: We print the results of each operation using f-strings, which allow us to embed expressions inside string literals.\n4. **Division by Zero Check**: Before calculating the quotient, we check if `num2` is zero to avoid a division by zero error. If `num2` is zero, we print a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 31.0\nThe difference of 10.5 and 20.5 is: -10.0\nThe product of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 215.25\nThe quotient of 10.5 and 20.5 is: 0.5121951219512195\n```",
