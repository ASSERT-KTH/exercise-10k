  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of Three Numbers**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the average of three numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num1, num2, num3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of three numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        num3 (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    average = calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)\n\n    print(f\"The average of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes three numbers as input and returns their average.\n2. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter three numbers.\n3. The `calculate_average` function is called with the user's input, and the result is stored in the `average` variable.\n4. The average is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `average.py`) and run it from the command line using `python average.py`. Follow the prompts to enter three numbers, and the program will display their average. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 20\nEnter the third number: 30\nThe average of 10.0, 20.0, and 30.0 is 20.0\n```",
