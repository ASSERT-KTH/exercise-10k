  "answer": "### Discount Function\n#### Description\nThis function calculates the price after a discount has been applied.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_discounted_price(original_price: float, discount_percentage: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the price after a discount has been applied.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The percentage discount to apply.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The price after the discount has been applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the discount percentage is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if not 0 <= discount_percentage <= 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100\")\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price\n\n    # Calculate the price after the discount\n    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount\n\n    return discounted_price\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    original_price = 100.0\n    discount_percentage = 20.0\n    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Discounted Price: ${discounted_price:.2f}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_discounted_price` takes two arguments: `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n* It first checks if the `discount_percentage` is valid (between 0 and 100). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* It then calculates the `discount_amount` by multiplying the `original_price` with the `discount_percentage` divided by 100.\n* Finally, it calculates the `discounted_price` by subtracting the `discount_amount` from the `original_price`.\n* The function returns the `discounted_price`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with an original price of $100.00 and a discount percentage of 20%.",
