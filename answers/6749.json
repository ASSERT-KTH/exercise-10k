  "prompt": "Understand the concept of variable scope and declare variables with local and global scope.",
  "answer": "**Variable Scope**\n====================\n\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and can be accessed. In programming, variables can have either local or global scope.\n\n**Local Scope**\n---------------\n\nA variable with local scope is defined within a block of code, such as a function, loop, or conditional statement. It can only be accessed within that block and is not accessible outside of it.\n\n**Global Scope**\n----------------\n\nA variable with global scope is defined outside of any block of code and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n\n**Declaring Variables with Local and Global Scope**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is an example in Python:\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = \"I am global\"\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Local variable\n    local_variable = \"I am local\"\n    print(\"Inside function:\")\n    print(\"Global variable:\", global_variable)\n    print(\"Local variable:\", local_variable)\n\nmy_function()\n\nprint(\"Outside function:\")\nprint(\"Global variable:\", global_variable)\n# Trying to access local variable outside function will raise an error\ntry:\n    print(\"Local variable:\", local_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Local variable is not accessible outside function\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n*   `global_variable` is a global variable that can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n*   `local_variable` is a local variable that can only be accessed within the `my_function` block.\n\n**Modifying Global Variables**\n-----------------------------\n\nTo modify a global variable within a function, you need to use the `global` keyword:\n\n```python\nglobal_variable = \"I am global\"\n\ndef my_function():\n    global global_variable\n    global_variable = \"I am modified\"\n    print(\"Inside function:\")\n    print(\"Global variable:\", global_variable)\n\nmy_function()\n\nprint(\"Outside function:\")\nprint(\"Global variable:\", global_variable)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `global` keyword is used to indicate that `global_variable` is a global variable that should be modified.\n\n**Best Practices**\n------------------\n\n*   Use local variables whenever possible to avoid polluting the global namespace.\n*   Use global variables sparingly and only when necessary.\n*   Avoid using the `global` keyword to modify global variables within functions, as it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Instead, consider passing variables as arguments to functions and returning modified values.",
