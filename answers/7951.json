  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of binary search on a sorted array of integers:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform binary search on a sorted array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n    - arr (list): A sorted list of integers.\n    - target (int): The target integer to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n    - int: The index of the target integer in the array if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target {target} not found in the array.\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `binary_search` function takes two parameters: `arr` (a sorted list of integers) and `target` (the integer to search for).\n*   It uses two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current search range in the array.\n*   In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the middle element `arr[mid]` with the `target`.\n*   If `arr[mid]` is equal to the `target`, the function returns the `mid` index.\n*   If `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, the function updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the array.\n*   If `arr[mid]` is greater than the `target`, the function updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the array.\n*   The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the `target` is not found in the array.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate the binary search function with a sample sorted array and a target value.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because with each iteration, the search space is reduced by half.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of binary search is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the target value, regardless of the size of the input array.",
