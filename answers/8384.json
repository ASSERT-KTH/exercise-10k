  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the Fibonacci numbers\n    fib_dict = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n\n    # Calculate the Fibonacci numbers from 2 to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the ith Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers\n        fib_dict[i] = fib_dict[i - 1] + fib_dict[i - 2]\n\n    # Return the nth Fibonacci number\n    return fib_dict[n]\n\n# Test the function\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(f\"The {i}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(i)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis solution works by:\n\n1.  **Initializing a dictionary**: We create a dictionary `fib_dict` to store the Fibonacci numbers, initializing it with the base cases `fib_dict[0] = 0` and `fib_dict[1] = 1`.\n2.  **Calculating Fibonacci numbers**: We iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive), calculating each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers (`fib_dict[i - 1]` and `fib_dict[i - 2]`) and storing it in the dictionary.\n3.  **Returning the nth Fibonacci number**: Finally, we return the `n`th Fibonacci number stored in the dictionary.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the input number. This is because we only need to iterate from 2 to `n` once to calculate the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is **O(n)** as well, since we need to store the Fibonacci numbers in the dictionary. However, this can be optimized to **O(1)** by only keeping track of the last two Fibonacci numbers, as we only need those to calculate the next one.\n\n### Optimization\n\nTo optimize the space complexity, we can modify the solution to only keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers. Here's an updated version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n\n    # Initialize the last two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n\n    # Calculate the Fibonacci numbers from 2 to n\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the last two\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n    # Return the nth Fibonacci number\n    return b\n\n# Test the function\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(f\"The {i}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(i)}\")\n```\n\nThis optimized solution has the same time complexity of **O(n)** but reduces the space complexity to **O(1)**.",
