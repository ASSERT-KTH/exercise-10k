  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses an if/else statement to manage a to-do list with priorities based on user input:\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store tasks\ntasks = {}\n\ndef add_task():\n    task_name = input(\"Enter task name: \")\n    priority = input(\"Enter task priority (High/Medium/Low): \")\n    \n    # Validate priority input\n    while priority not in [\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"]:\n        print(\"Invalid priority. Please enter High, Medium, or Low.\")\n        priority = input(\"Enter task priority (High/Medium/Low): \")\n        \n    # Add task to dictionary\n    tasks[task_name] = priority\n    print(f\"Task '{task_name}' added with priority '{priority}'\")\n\ndef view_tasks():\n    if not tasks:\n        print(\"No tasks in the list.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Tasks:\")\n        for task, priority in tasks.items():\n            print(f\"{task}: {priority}\")\n\ndef delete_task():\n    task_name = input(\"Enter task name to delete: \")\n    \n    # Check if task exists\n    if task_name in tasks:\n        del tasks[task_name]\n        print(f\"Task '{task_name}' deleted.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Task '{task_name}' not found.\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nTo-Do List Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add task\")\n        print(\"2. View tasks\")\n        print(\"3. Delete task\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        # Use if/else statement to manage user input\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            add_task()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            view_tasks()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            delete_task()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a dictionary to store tasks with their respective priorities. The `add_task()` function prompts the user to enter a task name and priority, validates the priority input, and adds the task to the dictionary. The `view_tasks()` function displays all tasks in the dictionary, and the `delete_task()` function removes a task from the dictionary based on the task name.\n\nThe `main()` function uses an if/else statement to manage user input and perform the corresponding action. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Add a task: Enter `1` at the menu, enter a task name and priority, and the task will be added to the list.\n* View tasks: Enter `2` at the menu, and all tasks in the list will be displayed.\n* Delete a task: Enter `3` at the menu, enter the task name, and the task will be removed from the list.\n* Exit program: Enter `4` at the menu, and the program will terminate.",
