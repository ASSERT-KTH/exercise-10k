  "answer": "**Sequence Printer**\n======================\n\nBelow is an example of how to ask the user for a number and print out the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number using Python:\n\n```python\ndef print_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a number and prints out the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for a number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Please enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if num <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n\n    # Print the sequence of numbers\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        print(i)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_sequence()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `print_sequence` function asks the user for a number using a `while` loop to handle invalid inputs.\n2. Once a valid positive integer is entered, the function uses a `for` loop to print the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number.\n3. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `num` (inclusive).\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `print_sequence` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n* Run the script and enter a positive integer when prompted.\n* The script will print the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number. For example, if you enter `5`, the output will be:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
