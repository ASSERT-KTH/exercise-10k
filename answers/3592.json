  "answer": "**Currency Converter Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes an amount of money and the exchange rate between two currencies as input, and returns the equivalent amount in the target currency.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate, from_currency, to_currency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an amount of money from one currency to another.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (float): The amount of money to convert.\n        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate between the two currencies.\n        from_currency (str): The currency of the input amount.\n        to_currency (str): The target currency.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The equivalent amount in the target currency.\n    \"\"\"\n    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate\n    return converted_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount of money: \"))\n    exchange_rate = float(input(\"Enter the exchange rate (1 {} = ? {}): \".format(\"USD\", \"EUR\")))\n    from_currency = input(\"Enter the currency of the input amount (e.g. USD): \")\n    to_currency = input(\"Enter the target currency (e.g. EUR): \")\n\n    # Convert currency\n    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate, from_currency, to_currency)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(\"{} {} is equal to {:.2f} {}\".format(amount, from_currency, converted_amount, to_currency))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the amount of money: `100`\n3. Enter the exchange rate (1 USD = ? EUR): `0.88`\n4. Enter the currency of the input amount (e.g. USD): `USD`\n5. Enter the target currency (e.g. EUR): `EUR`\n\nThe program will output:\n```\n100 USD is equal to 88.00 EUR\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the exchange rate is given as a ratio of the target currency to the input currency (e.g. 1 USD = 0.88 EUR).\n* The program uses a simple multiplication to perform the conversion.\n* The result is rounded to two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
