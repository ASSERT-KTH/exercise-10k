  "answer": "**Grade Average Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\nThis program takes user input for grades and calculates the average grade.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade from user input.\n    \"\"\"\n    grades = []\n    num_grades = int(input(\"Enter the number of grades: \"))\n\n    # Get user input for grades\n    for i in range(num_grades):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(f\"Enter grade {i+1}: \"))\n                if 0 <= grade <= 100:\n                    grades.append(grade)\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Invalid grade. Please enter a grade between 0 and 100.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate average grade\n    average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n    # Print average grade\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculate_average_grade()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of grades you want to calculate the average for (e.g., 3).\n3. Enter each grade individually (e.g., 85, 90, 78).\n4. The program will calculate and display the average grade (e.g., 84.33).\n\n### How it Works\n1. The program first asks the user to enter the number of grades they want to calculate the average for.\n2. It then prompts the user to enter each grade individually, validating that the input is a number between 0 and 100.\n3. Once all grades are entered, the program calculates the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n4. Finally, it prints the calculated average grade to two decimal places.",
