  "prompt": "Write a program that prompts the user for their name, age, and address, then prints out a formatted string with the provided information. The program should validate the user's age to ensure it is a positive integer.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n# Define a function to get the user's age\ndef input_age():\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n            if age < 0:\n                print(\"Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                return age\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the user's name\n    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n    \n    # Get the user's age\n    age = input_age()\n    \n    # Get the user's address\n    address = input(\"Enter your address: \")\n    \n    # Print out a formatted string with the user's information\n    print(f\"You are {name}, {age} years old, and live in {address}.\")\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nNote that I've added some error handling to the `input_age` function to ensure that the user's input is a positive integer. If the user enters a negative integer or a non-integer value, the function will print an error message and prompt the user to try again.",
