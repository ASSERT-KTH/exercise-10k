  "answer": "Here is a Python solution to simulate a coin flip using a for loop:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip_simulation(num_flips):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a coin flip a specified number of times and prints the results.\n\n    Args:\n        num_flips (int): The number of coin flips to simulate.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the number of heads and tails\n    num_heads = 0\n    num_tails = 0\n\n    # Simulate the coin flips\n    print(\"Simulating {} coin flips...\".format(num_flips))\n    for i in range(num_flips):\n        # Generate a random number, 0 or 1, to simulate the coin flip\n        flip = random.randint(0, 1)\n        \n        # Print the result of the flip\n        if flip == 0:\n            print(\"Flip {}: Heads\".format(i + 1))\n            num_heads += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"Flip {}: Tails\".format(i + 1))\n            num_tails += 1\n\n    # Print the final results\n    print(\"\\nFinal Results:\")\n    print(\"Heads: {}\".format(num_heads))\n    print(\"Tails: {}\".format(num_tails))\n\n    # Calculate and print the percentage of heads and tails\n    heads_percentage = (num_heads / num_flips) * 100\n    tails_percentage = (num_tails / num_flips) * 100\n    print(\"Heads Percentage: {:.2f}%\".format(heads_percentage))\n    print(\"Tails Percentage: {:.2f}%\".format(tails_percentage))\n\n# Example usage:\nnum_flips = 10\ncoin_flip_simulation(num_flips)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `coin_flip_simulation` that simulates a specified number of coin flips. The function uses a for loop to simulate each coin flip, and it uses the `random.randint` function to generate a random number (0 or 1) to determine the result of each flip. The function then prints the result of each flip and tracks the total number of heads and tails. After all the flips have been simulated, the function prints the final results, including the number of heads and tails and the percentage of each.\n\nTo use this program, simply call the `coin_flip_simulation` function with the desired number of coin flips as an argument, as shown in the example usage.",
