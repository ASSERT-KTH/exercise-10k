  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that retrieves a value from a dictionary based on a given key. This function will handle cases where the key is present or absent in the dictionary. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef get_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key: The key to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        The value associated with the key if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input is not a dictionary\")\n\n    # Then, we try to get the value associated with the given key\n    # We use the get method of the dictionary, which returns None by default if the key is not found\n    # This way, we avoid a KeyError that would be raised if we used dictionary[key]\n    value = dictionary.get(key)\n\n    # Finally, we return the value\n    return value\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Outputs: John\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Outputs: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_dict_value` first checks if the input `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary using `isinstance(dictionary, dict)`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then uses the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the value associated with the given `key`. This method returns `None` by default if the key is not found, avoiding a potential `KeyError`.\n* The function returns the retrieved `value`, which can be `None` if the key is not present in the dictionary.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, retrieving values for existing and non-existing keys.",
