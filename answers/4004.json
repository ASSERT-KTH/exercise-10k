  "answer": "**Decrementing Numbers Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1.\n\n```python\n# Decrementing Numbers Program\n\ndef print_decrementing_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a for loop.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(10, 0, -1):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Numbers from 10 to 1:\")\n    print_decrementing_numbers()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 10, stopping at 1 (exclusive), and decrementing by 1 in each step (due to the `-1` step value).\n* The for loop iterates over this sequence and prints each number.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block is used to ensure the `print_decrementing_numbers()` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nNumbers from 10 to 1:\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```",
