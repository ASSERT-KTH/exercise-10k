  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score. The program uses a dictionary to store the questions, answers, and scores.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# quiz_program.py\n\n# Dictionary to store questions, answers, and scores\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\",\n        \"score\": 10\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\",\n        \"score\": 10\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\",\n        \"score\": 10\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n    Args:\n        questions (dict): Dictionary containing questions, answers, and scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The user's final score.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\" and option != \"score\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            score += options[\"score\"]\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {options['answer']}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz program!\")\n    score = quiz(questions)\n    print(f\"Your final score is {score} out of {sum(question['score'] for question in questions.values())}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program using `python quiz_program.py`.\n2. Answer each question by entering the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will keep track of your score and display it at the end.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `questions` dictionary can be easily extended to add more questions.\n* The `quiz` function can be reused to create different quizzes with different questions.\n* The program uses a simple text-based interface, but it can be modified to use a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt for a more interactive experience.",
