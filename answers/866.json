  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a number and outputs the next number in the sequence based on the following conditions: if the number is even, the next number is the current number divided by 2, if the number is odd, the next number is the current number multiplied by 3 and added 1.",
  "answer": "**Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generator**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates the next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence based on the given input number. The sequence is defined as follows:\n\n* If the number is even, the next number is the current number divided by 2.\n* If the number is odd, the next number is the current number multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef next_collatz_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The current number in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        # If the number is even, divide by 2\n        return n // 2\n    else:\n        # If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1\n        return n * 3 + 1\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    next_num = next_collatz_number(num)\n    print(\"The next number in the Collatz Conjecture sequence is:\", next_num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 10 (even number)\nOutput: 5\n* Input: 7 (odd number)\nOutput: 22\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `next_collatz_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks whether it is even or odd using the modulo operator (`n % 2 == 0`).\n2. If the number is even, it returns the result of dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`n // 2`).\n3. If the number is odd, it returns the result of multiplying `n` by 3 and adding 1 (`n * 3 + 1`).\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, calls the `next_collatz_number` function with the input number, and prints the result.",
