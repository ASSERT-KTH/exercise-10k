It calculates the distance between the centers of the two circles, and then checks if the circles are separate, tangent, or overlapping. If the circles are separate or one is inside the other, it returns an empty list. If the circles are tangent or overlapping, it calculates the points of intersection using the formulas for the intersection of two circles.\n\nThe example usage shows how to call the `circle_intersection` function with two circles and print the points of intersection.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* This program assumes that the input circles are valid (i.e., their radii are non-negative).\n* The program uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the centers of the circles.\n* The program uses the formulas for the intersection of two circles, which can be found in many geometry and trigonometry textbooks.\n* The program returns a list of points of intersection, which can be empty if the circles do not intersect.",
