  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of all numbers in a given array.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers, mean):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return variance\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers, mean)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n    print(f\"Standard deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count.\n2. The `calculate_variance` function calculates the variance of a list of numbers by summing the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the count.\n3. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_standard_deviation` function with an example array.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses the population standard deviation formula. If you need to calculate the sample standard deviation, you should divide by `len(numbers) - 1` instead of `len(numbers)` in the `calculate_variance` function.",
