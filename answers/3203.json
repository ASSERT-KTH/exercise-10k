  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their quotient and remainder:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of the division of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dividend and divisor from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The quotient is: {quotient}\")\n        print(f\"The remainder is: {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function calculates the quotient and remainder using the `//` and `%` operators.\n2. The function checks if the divisor is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if it is.\n3. The `main` function gets the dividend and divisor from the user using the `input` function.\n4. The `main` function calls the `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function and prints the quotient and remainder.\n5. If a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, the `main` function catches it and prints the error message.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* If the user enters `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor, the program will print `The quotient is: 5` and `The remainder is: 0`.\n* If the user enters `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will print `The quotient is: 3` and `The remainder is: 2`.\n* If the user enters `10` as the dividend and `0` as the divisor, the program will print `Cannot divide by zero`.",
