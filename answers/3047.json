  "answer": "### Password Validation Function\n#### Description\nThis function checks if a given password meets the following conditions:\n- At least 8 characters long\n- Contains at least one uppercase letter\n- Contains at least one lowercase letter\n- Contains at least one digit\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following rules:\n    - At least 8 characters long\n    - Contains at least one uppercase letter\n    - Contains at least one lowercase letter\n    - Contains at least one digit\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the regular expression pattern\n    pattern = r\"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).{8,}$\"\n    \n    # Use the regular expression to match the password\n    if re.match(pattern, password):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    passwords = [\n        \"short\",  # Too short\n        \"longenough\",  # No uppercase letter, no digit\n        \"LongEnough\",  # No digit\n        \"LongEnough1\",  # Valid\n    ]\n\n    for password in passwords:\n        print(f\"Password: {password}, Valid: {validate_password(password)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function uses a regular expression to check the password against the defined rules. Here's a breakdown of the pattern used:\n- `^` asserts the start of the line\n- `(?=.*[a-z])` is a positive lookahead that checks for at least one lowercase letter\n- `(?=.*[A-Z])` is a positive lookahead that checks for at least one uppercase letter\n- `(?=.*\\d)` is a positive lookahead that checks for at least one digit\n- `.{8,}` checks for a minimum length of 8 characters\n- `$` asserts the end of the line\n\nIf the password matches this pattern, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.",
