  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the list. The function should handle empty lists and lists with a single element. The function should also handle lists with duplicate numbers.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that calculates the average of a list of integers, handling various edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate numbers. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average of a list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the list is empty. If it is, we return None.\n    if not num_list:\n        return None\n\n    # Next, we calculate the sum of all numbers in the list. We use the built-in sum function for this.\n    # The sum function adds up all elements in the given iterable (in this case, our list).\n    total_sum = sum(num_list)\n\n    # Then, we calculate the length of the list. We use the built-in len function for this.\n    # The len function returns the number of items in an object (in this case, our list).\n    list_length = len(num_list)\n\n    # Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.\n    # We use floating point division (/) to ensure that we get a float result, even if the division is not exact.\n    average = total_sum / list_length\n\n    # We return the calculated average.\n    return average\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average` first checks if the input list `num_list` is empty. If it is, the function returns `None` to indicate that there are no numbers to calculate an average from.\n* It then calculates the sum of all numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function and stores it in the `total_sum` variable.\n* The length of the list is calculated using the `len` function and stored in the `list_length` variable.\n* Finally, the function calculates the average by dividing `total_sum` by `list_length` using floating-point division and returns the result as a float.",
