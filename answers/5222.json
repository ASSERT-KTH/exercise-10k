  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the grade based on the given score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Score should be between 0 and 100.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We have a `calculate_grade` function that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n*   The `main` function gets the score from the user, checks if it's valid, and then calculates and prints the grade.\n*   We use a `while` loop to ensure the user enters a valid score between 0 and 100.\n*   We handle `ValueError` exceptions to catch any invalid inputs that can't be converted to integers.\n*   We use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the grade based on the given criteria.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters a score of 85, the program will print: \"The student's grade is: B\"\n*   If the user enters a score of 95, the program will print: \"The student's grade is: A\"\n*   If the user enters a score of 40, the program will print: \"The student's grade is: F\"",
