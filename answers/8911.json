  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so we return False.\n3. We only need to check up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root, it is not prime, so we return False.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, so we return True.\n6. The `main` function asks the user to input a number and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 25\nOutput: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Input: 23\nOutput: 23 is a prime number.\n* Input: 37\nOutput: 37 is a prime number.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `prime_checker.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using the command `python prime_checker.py`.\n4. Enter a number when prompted to check if it is prime.",
