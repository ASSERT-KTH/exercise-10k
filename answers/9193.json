  "answer": "**Variable Scope Resolution**\n=====================================\n\nVariable scope resolution refers to the process of determining the accessibility and visibility of a variable within a program. It is an essential concept in programming languages, as it helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures that variables are accessed correctly.\n\n**Types of Variable Scopes**\n-----------------------------\n\n1. **Global Scope**: A variable declared outside any function or block has global scope. It is accessible from anywhere in the program.\n2. **Local Scope**: A variable declared within a function or block has local scope. It is only accessible within that function or block.\n3. **Block Scope**: A variable declared within a block (e.g., `if`, `while`, `for`) has block scope. It is only accessible within that block.\n4. **Function Scope**: A variable declared within a function has function scope. It is only accessible within that function.\n\n**Scope Resolution Rules**\n---------------------------\n\n1. **Innermost scope first**: When resolving a variable, the innermost scope is checked first.\n2. **Scope chain**: If the variable is not found in the innermost scope, the scope chain is traversed upwards until the variable is found or the global scope is reached.\n3. **Shadowing**: If a variable with the same name is declared in an inner scope, it shadows the outer scope variable.\n\n**Examples**\n-------------\n\n### Example 1: Global and Local Scopes\n\n```python\nx = 10  # global scope\n\ndef foo():\n    x = 20  # local scope\n    print(x)  # prints 20\n\nfoo()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n\n### Example 2: Block Scope\n\n```python\nif True:\n    x = 10  # block scope\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n\n# x is not accessible here\ntry:\n    print(x)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"x is not defined\")\n```\n\n### Example 3: Function Scope\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    x = 10  # function scope\n    def bar():\n        print(x)  # prints 10\n    bar()\n\nfoo()\n# x is not accessible here\ntry:\n    print(x)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"x is not defined\")\n```\n\n### Example 4: Scope Chain\n\n```python\nx = 10  # global scope\n\ndef foo():\n    x = 20  # local scope\n    def bar():\n        print(x)  # prints 20\n    bar()\n\nfoo()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n\nIn summary, variable scope resolution is a crucial concept in programming languages. Understanding the different types of scopes (global, local, block, and function) and the scope resolution rules (innermost scope first, scope chain, and shadowing) is essential for writing correct and efficient code.",
