  "answer": "**Merging Two Sorted Lists**\n====================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a two-pointer technique to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first sorted list.\n        list2 (list): The second sorted list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\n        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n            result.append(list1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(list2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # Append the remaining elements, if any\n    while i < len(list1):\n        result.append(list1[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    while j < len(list2):\n        result.append(list2[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nlist1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nlist2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nmerged_list = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Merged sorted list:\", merged_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the beginning of `list1` and `list2`, respectively.\n2. Compare the elements at the current positions of `list1` and `list2`. The smaller element is appended to the `result` list, and the corresponding pointer is incremented.\n3. Repeat step 2 until one of the lists is exhausted.\n4. Append the remaining elements from the non-exhausted list to the `result` list.\n5. Return the merged sorted list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. This is because we are iterating through both lists once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n + m), as we are creating a new list to store the merged result.",
