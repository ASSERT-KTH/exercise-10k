  "prompt": "Write a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules and output the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define the game rules\ngame_rules = {\n    \"rock\": {\"scissors\": \"crushes\", \"lizard\": \"crushes\"},\n    \"paper\": {\"rock\": \"covers\", \"spock\": \"disproves\"},\n    \"scissors\": {\"paper\": \"cuts\", \"lizard\": \"decapitates\"},\n    \"lizard\": {\"spock\": \"poisons\", \"paper\": \"eats\"},\n    \"spock\": {\"scissors\": \"smashes\", \"rock\": \"vaporizes\"}\n}\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = list(game_rules.keys())\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game rules.\"\"\"\n    if player1 == player2:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif player2 in game_rules[player1]:\n        return f\"{player1.capitalize()} {game_rules[player1][player2]} {player2}. Player 1 wins!\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{player2.capitalize()} {game_rules[player2][player1]} {player1}. Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!\")\n    player1 = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock): \").lower()\n    while player1 not in game_rules:\n        player1 = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock: \").lower()\n    \n    player2 = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {player1}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {player2}\\n\")\n    \n    print(determine_winner(player1, player2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo run the game, simply execute the script. The program will ask for your choice, generate the computer's random choice, and determine the winner based on the game rules.\n\nExample output:\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nRock crushes scissors. Player 1 wins!\n```\n\nThis solution provides a simple and interactive way to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.",
