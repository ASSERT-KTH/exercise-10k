  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in percent).\n        time (float): The time period (in years).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in percent): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and print the simple interest.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the interest rate (in percent): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nThe simple interest is: 100.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple formula to calculate the simple interest: `Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100`.\n* The interest rate is assumed to be in percent.\n* The time period is assumed to be in years.\n* The program uses the `float` data type to handle decimal numbers.",
