  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(lst, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n    if not all(isinstance(num, int) for num in lst):\n        raise TypeError(\"All elements in the list must be integers.\")\n\n    total = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        total += num\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_sum(numbers))  # Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `calculate_sum` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.\n- We check if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are integers. If not, we raise a `TypeError`.\n- We initialize a variable `total` to 0 and then iterate over each number in the list, adding it to `total`.\n- Finally, we return the total sum.\n- In the example usage, we create a list of numbers and print the result of calling `calculate_sum` with this list.\n\nThis code can be simplified further using Python's built-in `sum` function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(lst):\n    if not isinstance(lst, list) or not all(isinstance(num, int) for num in lst):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of integers.\")\n    return sum(lst)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_sum(numbers))  # Output: 15\n```\n\nThis version of the function does exactly the same thing as the previous one but is more concise.",
