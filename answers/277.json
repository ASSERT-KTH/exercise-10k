  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the selling price of a product given its cost and markup percentage.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the selling price of a product given its cost and markup percentage:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the selling price of a product given its cost and markup percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        cost (float): The cost of the product.\n        markup_percentage (float): The markup percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The selling price of the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    markup_amount = (cost / 100) * markup_percentage\n    selling_price = cost + markup_amount\n    return selling_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the product: \"))\n    markup_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the markup percentage: \"))\n\n    selling_price = calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage)\n\n    print(f\"The selling price of the product is: ${selling_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `selling_price_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python selling_price_calculator.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the cost of the product and the markup percentage.\n5. The program will calculate and display the selling price of the product.\n\n### Example Use Case\nIf the cost of a product is $100 and the markup percentage is 20%, the program will calculate the selling price as follows:\n\n- Markup amount: ($100 / 100) * 20% = $20\n- Selling price: $100 + $20 = $120\n\nThe program will display the selling price as: `$120.00`",
