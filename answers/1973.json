  "prompt": "Create a function that implements the mergesort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. The function should take a list as an argument and return the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the mergesort algorithm according to the specifications:\n```\ndef mergesort(list):\n    # Base case: if the list has 0 or 1 elements, it is already sorted\n    if len(list) <= 1:\n        return list\n\n    # Find the middle of the list\n    mid = len(list) // 2\n\n    # Split the list into two halves\n    left = list[:mid]\n    right = list[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort the left and right halves\n    left = mergesort(left)\n    right = mergesort(right)\n\n    # Merge the sorted left and right halves\n    return merge(left, right)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    result = []\n    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:\n        if left[0] <= right[0]:\n            result.append(left.pop(0))\n        else:\n            result.append(right.pop(0))\n    result.extend(left)\n    result.extend(right)\n    return result\n```\nThis code implements the mergesort algorithm using the `mergesort` function and the `merge` function, as described in the specification. The `mergesort` function takes a list as input and returns the sorted list, while the `merge` function merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.",
