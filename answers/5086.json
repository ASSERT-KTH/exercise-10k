  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the guess to an integer\n        try:\n            guess = int(guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\n    if guess == number_to_guess:\n        print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n2. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n3. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. The user is prompted to guess the number.\n3. The program checks if the guess is correct, too low, or too high.\n4. If the guess is incorrect, the user is given a hint and prompted to guess again.\n5. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or types \"quit\" to give up.",
