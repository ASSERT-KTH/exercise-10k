  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their score. If the score is 50 or above, the student has passed. Otherwise, they have failed.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their score:\n\n```python\ndef check_pass_or_fail(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student has passed or failed based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: 'Passed' if the score is 50 or above, 'Failed' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 50:\n        return 'Passed'\n    else:\n        return 'Failed'\n\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    result = check_pass_or_fail(score)\n    print(f\"The student has {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function definition**: We define a function `check_pass_or_fail` that takes one argument `score`.\n2. **Conditional statement**: Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if the `score` is 50 or above.\n3. **Return values**: If the score is 50 or above, the function returns `'Passed'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Failed'`.\n4. **Main function**: In the `main` function, we ask the user for the student's score, call the `check_pass_or_fail` function, and print the result.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* If the user enters `60`, the program will output: `The student has Passed.`\n* If the user enters `40`, the program will output: `The student has Failed.`",
