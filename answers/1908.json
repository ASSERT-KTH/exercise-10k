  "prompt": "Calculate the distance between two points given their coordinates.",
  "answer": "To calculate the distance between two points given their coordinates, you can use the distance formula. The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is used to find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.\n\nThe distance formula is:\n\nd = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\n\nWhere:\n\n* d is the distance between the two points\n* (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the first point\n* (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the second point\n\nFor example, let's say you want to find the distance between the points (3, 4) and (6, 8). Plugging these values into the formula, you get:\n\nd = \u221a((6 - 3)\u00b2 + (8 - 4)\u00b2)\nd = \u221a((3)\u00b2 + (4)\u00b2)\nd = \u221a(9 + 16)\nd = \u221a25\nd = 5\n\nSo, the distance between the points (3, 4) and (6, 8) is 5 units.\n\nIf you have 3D coordinates, you can use the 3D distance formula:\n\nd = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 + (z2 - z1)\u00b2)\n\nWhere (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) are the coordinates of the two points in 3D space.\n\nDo you have specific coordinates you'd like to calculate the distance for?",
