  "answer": "**Union of Two Arrays Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes two arrays as input and returns their union. The union of two arrays is a new array that contains all unique elements from both arrays.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two arrays.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr1 (list): The first array.\n    arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The union of the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1 + arr2))\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Union:\", union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `union_of_arrays` takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input.\n2. It concatenates the two arrays using the `+` operator.\n3. The `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the concatenated array.\n4. The `list` function is used to convert the set back to a list.\n5. The function returns the resulting list, which is the union of the two input arrays.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nArray 2: [3, 4, 5, 6]\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the union array may not be the same as the original arrays, as sets are unordered in Python. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of both arrays and add them to the result list only if they are not already present.",
