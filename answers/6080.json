  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank account using a while loop. The program should allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a bank account using a while loop:\n```python\n# Bank Account Simulator\n\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.balance = 0.0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Thank you for using the bank account simulator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n*   The `main` function creates an instance of the `BankAccount` class and enters a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.\n*   Inside the loop, we display a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.\n*   Based on the user's choice, we prompt for the necessary input (e.g., amount to deposit or withdraw) and call the corresponding method on the `BankAccount` instance.\n*   If the user chooses to exit, we print a farewell message and break out of the loop.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Deposit $100: Choose option 1, enter `100` when prompted for the amount.\n*   Withdraw $50: Choose option 2, enter `50` when prompted for the amount.\n*   Check balance: Choose option 3.\n*   Exit the program: Choose option 4.\n\nYou can run this program and experiment with different scenarios to see how it works.",
