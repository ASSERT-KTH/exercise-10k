  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that sorts a list of tuples based on the second element using lambda functions. This response will provide a clear plan and explanation to help you understand the solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sort_tuples(tuples_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sorts a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.\n    \n    Args:\n        tuples_list (list): A list of tuples.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # First, we check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(tuples_list, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    \n    # Then, we check if all elements in the list are tuples\n    if not all(isinstance(t, tuple) for t in tuples_list):\n        raise TypeError(\"All elements in the list must be tuples\")\n    \n    # We use the built-in sorted function in Python, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.\n    # We pass a lambda function as the key argument to specify that we want to sort based on the second element of each tuple.\n    # The lambda function takes a tuple and returns its second element (index 1).\n    sorted_list = sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Finally, we return the sorted list\n    return sorted_list\n\n# Example usage:\ntuples_list = [(3, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4)]\nprint(sort_tuples(tuples_list))  # Output: [(2, 4), (3, 6), (1, 9)]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `sort_tuples` function first checks if the input `tuples_list` is a list and if all its elements are tuples, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* It then uses the built-in `sorted` function with a lambda function as the `key` argument to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.\n* The lambda function `lambda x: x[1]` takes a tuple `x` and returns its second element, which is used for sorting.\n* Finally, the function returns the sorted list of tuples.",
