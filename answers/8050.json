  "answer": "**Product Recommendation Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses an if/else statement to recommend products based on user input.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef recommend_product(interests):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recommends a product based on user interests.\n\n    Args:\n        interests (str): User's interests (e.g., \"gaming\", \"reading\", \"music\")\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Recommended product\n    \"\"\"\n    if interests.lower() == \"gaming\":\n        return \"We recommend a high-performance gaming laptop.\"\n    elif interests.lower() == \"reading\":\n        return \"We recommend an e-reader or a tablet with a reading app.\"\n    elif interests.lower() == \"music\":\n        return \"We recommend a portable Bluetooth speaker or headphones.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Sorry, we couldn't find a matching product. Please try again!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to our product recommendation program!\")\n    interests = input(\"What are your interests (e.g., gaming, reading, music)? \")\n    print(recommend_product(interests))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Gaming**:\n\t* User input: \"gaming\"\n\t* Output: \"We recommend a high-performance gaming laptop.\"\n2. **Reading**:\n\t* User input: \"reading\"\n\t* Output: \"We recommend an e-reader or a tablet with a reading app.\"\n3. **Music**:\n\t* User input: \"music\"\n\t* Output: \"We recommend a portable Bluetooth speaker or headphones.\"\n4. **Unknown interest**:\n\t* User input: \"hiking\"\n\t* Output: \"Sorry, we couldn't find a matching product. Please try again!\"\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `recommend_product` function takes a string input `interests` from the user.\n2. The function uses an if/else statement to check the user's interests and return a corresponding product recommendation.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for their interests, calls the `recommend_product` function, and prints the recommended product.\n4. The program uses the `lower()` method to make the input case-insensitive.",
