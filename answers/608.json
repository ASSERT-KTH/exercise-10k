  "answer": "**Calculating Square Root**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the square root of a given number using the `math` library.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the square root of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The number for which to calculate the square root.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square root of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number\")\n    return math.sqrt(number)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    number = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    try:\n        square_root = calculate_square_root(number)\n        print(f\"The square root of {number} is {square_root}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_square_root` function takes a number as input and returns its square root.\n2. The function checks if the input number is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError` because the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number.\n3. The `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, and the square root is calculated and printed.\n\n**Note**\n-------\n\n* This program uses the `math` library, which is a built-in Python library.\n* The `math.sqrt` function returns a floating-point number, which means it can handle decimal numbers.\n* If you want to calculate the square root of a complex number, you would need to use a different approach, such as using the `cmath` library.",
