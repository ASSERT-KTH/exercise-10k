  "prompt": "Perform arithmetic operations on integers: given two integers 10 and 5, calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient.",
  "answer": "## Step 1: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nTo find the sum, we simply add the two numbers together: 10 + 5 = 15.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the difference of the two integers\nTo find the difference, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 10 - 5 = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the two integers\nTo find the product, we multiply the two numbers together: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the quotient of the two integers\nTo find the quotient, we divide the larger number by the smaller one: 10 / 5 = 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
