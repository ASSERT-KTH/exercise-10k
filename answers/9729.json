  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two points as input and returns the distance between them.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n    point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n    point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Unpack the coordinates from the input tuples\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n\n    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Calculate the Euclidean distance using the formula sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)\n    distance = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)\n\n    return distance\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    point1 = (1, 2)  # coordinates of the first point\n    point2 = (4, 6)  # coordinates of the second point\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples representing the coordinates of two points.\n2. It calculates the differences in x and y coordinates (`dx` and `dy`) between the two points.\n3. It applies the Euclidean distance formula (`sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)`) to find the distance between the points.\n4. The function returns the calculated distance.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n*   To find the distance between two points (1, 2) and (4, 6), you can call the `calculate_distance` function with these points as arguments, like this: `calculate_distance((1, 2), (4, 6))`. The function will return the distance between the two points, which is approximately 5.00.",
