  "answer": "**Generating Prime Numbers**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python function that generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef generate_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit for generating prime numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of prime numbers up to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)\n    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n\n    for current_prime in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if sieve[current_prime]:\n            for multiple in range(current_prime * current_prime, n + 1, current_prime):\n                sieve[multiple] = False\n\n    return [num for num, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 50\n    primes = generate_primes(n)\n    print(f\"Prime numbers up to {n}: {primes}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\nThis function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize the sieve**: Create a list of boolean values, where each index represents a number up to `n`. Initialize all values to `True`, assuming all numbers are prime initially.\n2. **Mark non-prime numbers**: Set the values at indices 0 and 1 to `False`, as they are not prime numbers.\n3. **Iterate through prime numbers**: Start from the first prime number (2) and iterate up to the square root of `n`.\n4. **Mark multiples as non-prime**: For each prime number, mark its multiples as non-prime by setting their corresponding sieve values to `False`.\n5. **Return prime numbers**: Use a list comprehension to return a list of numbers whose sieve values are still `True`, indicating they are prime.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it efficient for generating prime numbers up to a given number.",
