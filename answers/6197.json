  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains only alphabetic characters, False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that checks if a given string contains only alphabetic characters, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_alphabetic(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given string contains only alphabetic characters.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the string contains only alphabetic characters, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We'll use the built-in isalpha() method in Python, which returns True if all characters in the string are alphabets\n    # However, this method also returns False for empty strings, so we need to handle that case separately\n\n    # First, we check if the string is empty\n    if not string:\n        # If the string is empty, we return False as per the problem statement\n        return False\n\n    # Now, we can use the isalpha() method to check if all characters in the string are alphabets\n    # This method will return True if all characters are alphabets and there is at least one character, otherwise it will return False\n    return string.isalpha()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_alphabetic` takes a string as input and checks if it's empty. If the string is empty, it immediately returns `False` as per the problem statement.\n* It utilizes Python's built-in `isalpha()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabets. This method also correctly handles the case where the string contains at least one character.\n* By combining these two conditions, the function accurately determines whether the input string contains only alphabetic characters, making it a straightforward and efficient solution.\n* The function is well-documented with clear and concise comments, explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values, making it easy to understand and use.",
