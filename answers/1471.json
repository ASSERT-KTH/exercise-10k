  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a floating-point input from the user, rounds it to the nearest integer, and prints the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    float x;\n    printf(\"Enter a floating-point number: \");\n    scanf(\"%f\", &x);\n    printf(\"Rounded value: %d\\n\", round(x));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications and included all the necessary elements:\n\n* Included the `stdio.h` and `math.h` header files\n* Declared the `main` function with a return type of `int`\n* Declared a `float` variable `x` to store the user's input\n* Printed a prompt to the user using `printf`\n* Used `scanf` to read the user's input and store it in `x`\n* Printed the rounded value using `printf` and `round(x)`\n* Returned `0` to indicate successful program execution\n\nNote that I've assumed that the `round` function is available, which is part of the C99 standard. If you're using an older version of C, you may need to use a different rounding function or implement one yourself.",
