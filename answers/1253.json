  "answer": "### Fibonacci Sequence Generator\n#### Overview\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef fibonacci():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator that yields the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \n    Yields:\n        int: The next number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while True:\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    fib = fibonacci()\n    for _ in range(10):  # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n        print(next(fib))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n* The `fibonacci` function initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n* The function enters an infinite loop, yielding the current value of `a` on each iteration.\n* After yielding `a`, the function updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b`, respectively, effectively moving to the next number in the sequence.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to create a Fibonacci generator and print the first 10 numbers in the sequence.",
