  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n2. The function checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n4. The program prints the average of the list of numbers.\n\n**Running the Program**\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `average.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python average.py`). The program will output the average of the example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Output**\n\n```\nThe average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0\n```",
