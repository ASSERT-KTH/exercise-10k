  "answer": "**Password Generator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random password based on the user's input. The user can specify the length of the password, the types of characters to include, and whether to include special characters, numbers, or uppercase letters.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password based on the user's input.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password.\n        use_uppercase (bool): Whether to include uppercase letters.\n        use_numbers (bool): Whether to include numbers.\n        use_special_chars (bool): Whether to include special characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n    chars = string.ascii_lowercase\n    if use_uppercase:\n        chars += string.ascii_uppercase\n    if use_numbers:\n        chars += string.digits\n    if use_special_chars:\n        chars += string.punctuation\n\n    password = ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))\n    return password\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Password Generator\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n\n    length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the password: \"))\n    use_uppercase = input(\"Include uppercase letters? (y/n): \").lower() == 'y'\n    use_numbers = input(\"Include numbers? (y/n): \").lower() == 'y'\n    use_special_chars = input(\"Include special characters? (y/n): \").lower() == 'y'\n\n    password = generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars)\n    print(\"Generated Password : \", password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Generate a password with a length of 12, including uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters:\n\t* Enter the length of the password: 12\n\t* Include uppercase letters? (y/n): y\n\t* Include numbers? (y/n): y\n\t* Include special characters? (y/n): y\n2. Generate a password with a length of 8, including only lowercase letters and numbers:\n\t* Enter the length of the password: 8\n\t* Include uppercase letters? (y/n): n\n\t* Include numbers? (y/n): y\n\t* Include special characters? (y/n): n\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file named `password_generator.py` and execute it using Python:\n```bash\npython password_generator.py\n```\nFollow the prompts to generate a password based on your input.",
