  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the current time as input and prints out a greeting based on the time of day.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef print_greeting():\n    # Get the current time\n    now = datetime.now()\n    \n    # Get the hour from the current time\n    hour = now.hour\n    \n    # Determine the greeting based on the hour\n    if 0 <= hour < 12:\n        greeting = \"Good morning!\"\n    elif 12 <= hour < 17:\n        greeting = \"Good afternoon!\"\n    else:\n        greeting = \"Good evening!\"\n    \n    # Print the greeting\n    print(greeting)\n\n# Call the function\nprint_greeting()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n* We use the `datetime` module to get the current time.\n* We extract the hour from the current time using the `hour` attribute of the `datetime` object.\n* We use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the greeting based on the hour.\n* We print the greeting using the `print` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the current time is 8:00 AM, the program will print \"Good morning!\".\n* If the current time is 2:00 PM, the program will print \"Good afternoon!\".\n* If the current time is 8:00 PM, the program will print \"Good evening!\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. Import the `datetime` module.\n2. Create a `datetime` object to get the current time.\n3. Extract the hour from the current time.\n4. Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the greeting based on the hour.\n5. Print the greeting.\n\nNote: This program uses the 24-hour clock to determine the greeting. If you want to use the 12-hour clock, you can modify the `if-elif-else` statement accordingly.",
