  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array and a number of positions as input, and returns the array rotated to the right by the given number of positions. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number of positions is 2, the output should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].",
  "answer": "### Array Rotation Function\n#### Description\nThis function takes an array and a number of positions as input, and returns the array rotated to the right by the given number of positions.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef rotate_array(arr, num_positions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate the array to the right by the given number of positions.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n        num_positions (int): The number of positions to rotate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases where the array is empty or the number of positions is 0\n    if not arr or num_positions == 0:\n        return arr\n\n    # Calculate the effective number of positions to rotate, considering the length of the array\n    effective_positions = num_positions % len(arr)\n\n    # Split the array into two parts: the last 'effective_positions' elements and the rest\n    # Then, concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation effect\n    rotated_arr = arr[-effective_positions:] + arr[:-effective_positions]\n\n    return rotated_arr\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnum_positions = 2\nprint(rotate_array(arr, num_positions))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The function first checks for edge cases where the array is empty or the number of positions is 0. If either condition is true, it returns the original array.\n*   It then calculates the effective number of positions to rotate by taking the modulus of the number of positions with the length of the array. This ensures that the rotation is within the bounds of the array.\n*   The function splits the array into two parts: the last 'effective_positions' elements and the rest. It then concatenates these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation effect.\n*   Finally, the function returns the rotated array.",
