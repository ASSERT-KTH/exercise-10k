  "prompt": "Implement the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted list of integers. The program should take a sorted list and a target element as input and output the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the binary search algorithm:\n```\ndef binary_search(numbers, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(numbers) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        guess = numbers[mid]\n        if guess == target:\n            return mid\n        elif guess > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return -1\n\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\ntarget = 3\nprint(binary_search(numbers, target))  # Output: 1\n```\nThis code defines a function `binary_search` that takes a sorted list of integers `numbers` and a target integer `target` as input, and returns the index of the `target` element in the list if found, or -1 if not found. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search space in half until the `target` element is found or the search space is empty.",
