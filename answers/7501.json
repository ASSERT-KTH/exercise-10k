  "answer": "**Variable Scope Example**\n================================\n\nIn this example, we will demonstrate the scope of a variable in Python. The scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where the variable is defined and accessible.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Global scope\nx = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing scope\n    y = 20\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local scope\n        z = 30\n        print(\"Inner function:\")\n        print(\"x (global):\", x)\n        print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n        print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Outer function:\")\n    print(\"x (global):\", x)\n    print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n    # Trying to print z will result in an error\n    # print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\nprint(\"Global scope:\")\nprint(\"x (global):\", x)\n# Trying to print y or z will result in an error\n# print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n# print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\nouter_function()\n```\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nGlobal scope:\nx (global): 10\nInner function:\nx (global): 10\ny (enclosing): 20\nz (local): 30\nOuter function:\nx (global): 10\ny (enclosing): 20\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We define a variable `x` in the global scope with the value `10`.\n2.  We define an `outer_function` that has access to the global scope and defines its own variable `y` with the value `20`.\n3.  Inside `outer_function`, we define an `inner_function` that has access to both the global scope and the enclosing scope of `outer_function`. It defines its own variable `z` with the value `30`.\n4.  We print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` from `inner_function`. Since `inner_function` has access to all three scopes, it can print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n5.  We print the values of `x` and `y` from `outer_function`. Since `outer_function` has access to the global scope and its own scope, it can print the values of `x` and `y`. However, it cannot print the value of `z` because `z` is defined in the local scope of `inner_function`.\n6.  Finally, we print the value of `x` from the global scope. Since the global scope only has access to its own variables, it can only print the value of `x`.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n----------------\n\n*   Variables defined in a scope are accessible from that scope and any nested scopes.\n*   Variables defined in a nested scope are not accessible from the outer scope.\n*   The `global` keyword can be used to modify global variables from within a function.\n*   The `nonlocal` keyword can be used to modify variables from the enclosing scope from within a nested function.",
