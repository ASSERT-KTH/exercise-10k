  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the nth triangle number. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and sum them up.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that calculates the nth triangle number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nth_triangle_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth triangle number.\n\n    The nth triangle number is the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n    For example, the 5th triangle number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position of the triangle number to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The nth triangle number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and sum them up\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += i\n\n    return total\n\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5\nresult = calculate_nth_triangle_number(n)\nprint(f\"The {n}th triangle number is: {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `calculate_nth_triangle_number(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It checks if `n` is less than 1 and raises a `ValueError` if it is, because the triangle numbers are only defined for positive integers.\n3. It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n4. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and adds each number to the `total`.\n5. Finally, it returns the `total`, which is the nth triangle number.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* `calculate_nth_triangle_number(5)` returns `15` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)\n* `calculate_nth_triangle_number(10)` returns `55` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55)",
