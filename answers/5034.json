  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses for loops to search for a given substring in a text.\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(text, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a given substring in a text and returns the indices of all occurrences.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The text to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of indices where the substring was found.\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = []\n    for i in range(len(text)):\n        match = True\n        for j in range(len(substring)):\n            if i + j >= len(text) or text[i + j] != substring[j]:\n                match = False\n                break\n        if match:\n            indices.append(i)\n    return indices\n\n\ndef main():\n    text = \"Hello, world! Hello again!\"\n    substring = \"Hello\"\n    indices = find_substring(text, substring)\n\n    if indices:\n        print(f\"The substring '{substring}' was found at indices: {indices}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The substring '{substring}' was not found in the text.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `find_substring` function iterates over each character in the text using a for loop.\n2. For each character, it checks if the substring matches the characters starting at the current index using a nested for loop.\n3. If a match is found, the index is added to the `indices` list.\n4. The function returns the list of indices where the substring was found.\n5. In the `main` function, we test the `find_substring` function with a sample text and substring, and print the results.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* Searching for a specific word or phrase in a large text document.\n* Validating user input by checking if a given string contains a specific substring.\n* Parsing text data by finding specific patterns or substrings.",
