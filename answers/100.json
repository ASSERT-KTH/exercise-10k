  "answer": "**Three Sum Problem**\n=======================\n\nThe three sum problem is a well-known problem in computer science, where you are given a list of integers and need to find all triplets that sum to zero.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a two-pointer technique to find the triplets:\n\n```python\ndef three_sum(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all triplets in the given list of integers that sum to zero.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of triplets that sum to zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    nums.sort()\n    triplets = []\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):\n        # Skip the same result\n        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:\n            continue\n        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1\n        while left < right:\n            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]\n            if total < 0:\n                left += 1\n            elif total > 0:\n                right -= 1\n            else:\n                triplets.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])\n                # Skip the same result\n                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:\n                    left += 1\n                # Skip the same result\n                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:\n                    right -= 1\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n    return triplets\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]\nprint(three_sum(nums))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1.  First, we sort the input list `nums` in ascending order.\n2.  We then iterate over the list with a pointer `i`, starting from the first element and ending at the third last element (`len(nums) - 2`).\n3.  For each `i`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find a pair of elements that sum to `-nums[i]`. We initialize `left` to `i + 1` and `right` to the last element (`len(nums) - 1`).\n4.  We then enter a loop where we calculate the total sum of `nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]`.\n5.  If the total sum is less than zero, we increment `left` to increase the sum.\n6.  If the total sum is greater than zero, we decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n7.  If the total sum is equal to zero, we add the triplet to the result list and move both `left` and `right` pointers.\n8.  We also skip duplicate triplets by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one.\n9.  Finally, we return the list of triplets that sum to zero.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we have a nested loop structure, where the outer loop iterates over the list and the inner loop uses two pointers to find the pair of elements that sum to the target value.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we store the result triplets in a list, which can grow up to the size of the input list in the worst case.",
