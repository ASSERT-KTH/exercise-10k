  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a grouping function as input, groups the list into sublists based on the grouping function, and returns the grouped list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to help you create a function that groups a list into sublists based on a given grouping function. This response will guide you through understanding and implementing the code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef group_list(input_list, grouping_function):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function groups a list into sublists based on a given grouping function.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be grouped.\n        grouping_function (function): A function that takes an element and returns a key for grouping.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is a group and each value is a list of elements in that group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped lists\n    grouped_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # Calculate the group key for the current element using the grouping function\n        group_key = grouping_function(element)\n\n        # If the group key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value\n        if group_key not in grouped_dict:\n            # This is a new group, so create a new list for it\n            grouped_dict[group_key] = []\n\n        # Add the current element to its corresponding group in the dictionary\n        grouped_dict[group_key].append(element)\n\n    # Return the dictionary of grouped lists\n    return grouped_dict\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a grouping function that groups numbers by their parity\ndef parity_grouping_function(num):\n    return \"even\" if num % 2 == 0 else \"odd\"\n\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Group the list using the parity grouping function\ngrouped_numbers = group_list(numbers, parity_grouping_function)\n\n# Print the grouped list\nprint(grouped_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `group_list` function initializes an empty dictionary `grouped_dict` to store the grouped lists. It then iterates over each element in the `input_list`, calculating the group key for each element using the provided `grouping_function`.\n* For each element, if the calculated `group_key` is not already a key in `grouped_dict`, it adds the key with an empty list as its value. Then, it appends the current element to the corresponding group in the dictionary.\n* The function finally returns the `grouped_dict`, which contains the grouped lists.\n* In the example usage, a `parity_grouping_function` is defined to demonstrate how to group numbers by their parity (even or odd), and the `group_list` function is applied to a list of numbers using this grouping function.",
