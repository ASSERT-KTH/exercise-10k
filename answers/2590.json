  "answer": "**First Duplicate Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate in a given list of numbers. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far and their indices.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate number. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num in seen:\n            # If we've seen this number before, return it\n            return num\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add it to the seen dictionary\n            seen[num] = i\n    # If we've iterated through the entire list and found no duplicates, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_first_duplicate` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty dictionary `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far and their indices.\n3. It iterates through the input list using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and the value of each element.\n4. For each number, it checks if it is already in the `seen` dictionary. If it is, it means we've seen this number before, so it returns the number as the first duplicate.\n5. If the number is not in the `seen` dictionary, it adds it to the dictionary with its index as the value.\n6. If it iterates through the entire list and finds no duplicates, it returns None.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `find_first_duplicate` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it iterates through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, it needs to store all numbers in the `seen` dictionary.",
