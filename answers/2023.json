  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum of three numbers using if/else statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that finds the maximum of three numbers using if/else statements:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b, c):\n    if a >= b and a >= c:\n        return a\n    elif b >= a and b >= c:\n        return b\n    else:\n        return c\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 20\nnum3 = 30\nprint(\"Maximum of\", num1, num2, \"and\", num3, \"is\", find_max(num1, num2, num3))\n```\n\nIn this program, the `find_max` function takes three numbers as input and uses if/else statements to determine which one is the maximum. It then returns this maximum value. The test case at the end of the program demonstrates how to use this function.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Python's built-in `max` function to achieve the same result with a single line of code:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b, c):\n    return max(a, b, c)\n```\n\nHowever, the original program using if/else statements is provided to meet the specific requirement of the problem.",
