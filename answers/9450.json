  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'quit' to exit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'quit':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins!\")\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`).\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Gameplay**\n------------\n\n1. The program will ask you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) or 'quit' to exit.\n2. If you enter an invalid choice, the program will ask you to try again.\n3. The computer will generate a random choice and display it.\n4. The program will determine the winner based on the game's rules and display the result.\n5. You can play multiple rounds by entering a new choice after each round. To exit the game, enter 'quit'.",
