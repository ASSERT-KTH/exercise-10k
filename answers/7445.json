  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The program should take an array as input, iterate through each element, and return the maximum value found.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\ndef findmax(list):\n    max = 0\n    for i in list:\n        if i > max:\n            max = i\n    return max\n\n# Example usage:\nlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(findmax(list))  # Output: 5\n```\nPlease note that I've left the author and date fields blank, as I don't have that information. You should fill those in accordingly. Also, this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least one integer. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which may not be the desired behavior. You may want to add error checking to handle this case.",
