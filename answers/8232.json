The program defines a `Character` class to store the character's attributes.\n2. The `create_character` function prompts the user to enter their character's name and select their character's type.\n3. Based on the character type, the program assigns default stats for strength, agility, and intelligence.\n4. The user is given the option to customize their character's stats.\n5. If the user chooses to customize, they are prompted to enter values for strength, agility, and intelligence.\n6. The program validates the user's input to ensure it is within the allowed range (1-20).\n7. Finally, the program creates a `Character` object with the user's input and prints out the character's stats.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nCreate Your Game Character\n---------------------------\nEnter your character's name: John\nSelect your character's type:\n1. Warrior\n2. Mage\n3. Rogue\nEnter the number of your choice: 1\nDo you want to customize your character's stats?\n1. Yes\n2. No\nEnter the number of your choice: 1\nEnter your character's strength (1-20): 19\nEnter your character's agility (1-20): 10\nEnter your character's intelligence (1-20): 6\n\nYour Character's Stats:\n------------------------\nName: John\nType: Warrior\nStrength: 19\nAgility: 10\nIntelligence: 6\n```",
