  "answer": "**Calculating Average Score using a For Loop**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average score of a student from a list of exam scores using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_score(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average score from a list of exam scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of exam scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average score.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_score = 0\n    for score in scores:\n        total_score += score\n    average_score = total_score / len(scores)\n    return average_score\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    exam_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]\n    average = calculate_average_score(exam_scores)\n    print(f\"Exam Scores: {exam_scores}\")\n    print(f\"Average Score: {average:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average_score` function takes a list of exam scores as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `total_score` to 0 to store the sum of all scores.\n3. It uses a for loop to iterate over each score in the list, adding it to `total_score`.\n4. After the loop, it calculates the average score by dividing `total_score` by the number of scores (obtained using `len(scores)`).\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_average_score` with an example list of exam scores.\n6. It prints the exam scores and the calculated average score, rounded to two decimal places using `:.2f`.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nExam Scores: [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]\nAverage Score: 86.60\n```",
