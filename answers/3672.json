  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as input and returns its square root.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that calculates the square root of a given number. This response will guide you through the process and provide a clear explanation of the code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the square root of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The input number for which the square root is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square root of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input number is negative, because square root of negative numbers is not defined in real mathematics\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number cannot be negative\")\n\n    # Now, we use the math.sqrt function from Python's math module to calculate the square root\n    # This function returns the square root of the given number\n    square_root = math.sqrt(number)\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated square root\n    return square_root\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_square_root(9))  # Output: 3.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_square_root` takes a `number` as input and first checks if it's negative. If so, it raises a `ValueError` because square roots of negative numbers are undefined in real mathematics.\n* It then uses the `math.sqrt` function from Python's math module to calculate the square root of the input `number`.\n* The calculated square root is stored in the `square_root` variable and returned as the result.\n* The code includes a test case that demonstrates the function's usage by calculating the square root of 9 and printing the result.",
