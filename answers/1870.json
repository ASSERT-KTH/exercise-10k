  "answer": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem. This program will partition a list of integers into two lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.\n\n```python\ndef partition_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions a list into two lists based on a condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements for which the condition is True,\n               and the second list contains elements for which the condition is False.\n    \"\"\"\n    true_list = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]\n    false_list = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]\n    return true_list, false_list\n\n\ndef is_even(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is even.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, is_even)\n\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n    print(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `partition_list` that takes a list and a condition as input and returns two lists: one for elements that satisfy the condition and one for elements that do not. The `is_even` function is used as the condition to partition the list into even and odd numbers. The `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions to partition a list of numbers and print the results.",
