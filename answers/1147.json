  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of all numbers in the list, and then divides the sum by the total count of numbers to find the average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return 0\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 to avoid division by zero.\n3. It calculates the sum of all numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It divides the sum by the total count of numbers in the list (obtained using the `len` function) to find the average.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the example list of numbers. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
