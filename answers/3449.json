  "answer": "**Calculator Program**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two numbers and an operation as input, and performs the specified operation.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the specified operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The operation to perform. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Operations:\")\n    print(\"1.
