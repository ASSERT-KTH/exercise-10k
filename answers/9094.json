  "prompt": "Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print 'Loop' instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print 'Py'. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'LoopPy'. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and conditional statements to check for multiples.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that the specifications describe:\n```\nfor num in range(1, 101):\n    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"LoopPy\")\n    elif num % 3 == 0:\n        print(\"Loop\")\n    elif num % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"Py\")\n    else:\n        print(num)\n```",
