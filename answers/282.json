  "answer": "**Multiplication Table Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n    \n    Args:\n        number (int): The number for which the multiplication table is printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Multiplication Table for {number}:\")\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{number} x {i} = {number * i}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n    \n    # Print the multiplication table\n    print_multiplication_table(number)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a number. After entering a number, it will print the multiplication table for that number up to 10.\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\nMultiplication Table for 5:\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `print_multiplication_table` function takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.\n2. The `main` function gets a number from the user, checks if it's a valid integer, and calls the `print_multiplication_table` function.\n3. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and prints the multiplication of the input number with each iteration.",
