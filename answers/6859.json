  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average salary of employees from a given dictionary. This function will handle cases where the dictionary is empty and provide the average salary when it's not. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_salary(employee_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average salary of all employees in the given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        employee_data (dict): A dictionary containing employee data. The dictionary should have employee IDs as keys and another dictionary as values.\n                              The inner dictionary should contain the employee's name, age, and salary.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average salary of all employees. If the dictionary is empty, the function returns 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we return 0 as per the problem statement.\n    if not employee_data:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of all salaries. We start with 0 because we haven't added any salaries yet.\n    total_salary = 0\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the count of employees. We start with 0 because we haven't counted any employees yet.\n    employee_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each employee in the dictionary.\n    for employee in employee_data.values():\n        # For each employee, add their salary to the total salary.\n        total_salary += employee['salary']\n        \n        # Increment the employee count by 1.\n        employee_count += 1\n\n    # Calculate the average salary by dividing the total salary by the employee count.\n    average_salary = total_salary / employee_count\n\n    # Return the calculated average salary.\n    return average_salary\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average_salary` takes a dictionary `employee_data` as input and first checks if it's empty. If the dictionary is empty, the function returns 0 as per the problem statement.\n* It then initializes two variables, `total_salary` and `employee_count`, to keep track of the sum of all salaries and the number of employees, respectively. It iterates over each employee in the dictionary, adding their salary to `total_salary` and incrementing `employee_count`.\n* After iterating over all employees, the function calculates the average salary by dividing `total_salary` by `employee_count`.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated average salary.",
