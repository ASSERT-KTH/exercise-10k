  "prompt": "Create a program that processes student data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary contains student names as keys and their respective grades as values. The program should calculate the average grade, find the student with the highest grade, and print out all students with grades above the average.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the dictionary\nstudent_data = {\n    'John': 80,\n    'Emily': 90,\n    'Michael': 70,\n    'Sarah': 85,\n    'William': 95,\n    'Olivia': 75,\n    'David': 65,\n    'Ava': 85,\n    'Joseph': 70,\n    'Isabella': 90,\n    'James': 80,\n    'Sophia': 85,\n    'Robert': 75,\n    'Mia': 90,\n    'Richard': 70,\n    'Charlotte': 85\n}\n\n# Calculate the average grade\naverage_grade = sum(student_data.values()) / len(student_data)\nprint(f'Average grade: {average_grade}')\n\n# Find the student with the highest grade\nhighest_grade = max(student_data.values())\nprint(f'Highest grade: {highest_grade}')\n\n# Find the student with the highest grade\nhighest_grade_student = [name for name, grade in student_data.items() if grade == highest_grade]\nprint(f'Student(s) with the highest grade: {highest_grade_student}')\n\n# Find students with grades above the average\nabove_average_students = {name: grade for name, grade in student_data.items() if grade > average_grade}\nprint(f'Students with grades above the average: {above_average_students}')\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification and produces the desired output. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
