  "answer": "**Unique Paths in a Grid Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a grid, where you can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef unique_paths(rows: int, cols: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a grid.\n\n    Args:\n    rows (int): The number of rows in the grid.\n    cols (int): The number of columns in the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of unique paths.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a 2D array to store the number of unique paths to each cell.\n    dp = [[1]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner.\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            # The number of unique paths to a cell is the sum of the number of unique paths to the cell above it and the cell to its left.\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]\n\n    # The number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner is stored in the bottom-right cell of the dp array.\n    return dp[rows-1][cols-1]\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    rows = 3\n    cols = 7\n    print(f\"Number of unique paths in a {rows}x{cols} grid: {unique_paths(rows, cols)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the cell at position `(i, j)`.\n*   The base cases are when `i` or `j` is 0, in which case there is only one way to reach the cell (by always moving down or always moving right). This is why the first row and column of the `dp` array are initialized with 1s.\n*   For other cells, the number of unique paths is the sum of the number of unique paths to the cell above it and the cell to its left. This is because you can reach a cell by moving down from the cell above it or by moving right from the cell to its left.\n*   Finally, the function returns the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner, which is stored in the bottom-right cell of the `dp` array.",
