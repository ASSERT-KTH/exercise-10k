It provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program.\n\nThe program has the following features:\n\n*   **Add Student Grade**: Allows users to add a new student grade to the dictionary.\n*   **Remove Student Grade**: Removes a student grade from the dictionary.\n*   **Update Student Grade**: Updates a student grade in the dictionary.\n*   **Calculate Average Grade**: Calculates the average grade of all students.\n*   **Display Student Grade**: Displays the grade of a specific student.\n*   **Exit**: Exits the program.\n\nThe program uses functions to organize the code and make it more readable. Each function has a specific responsibility, such as displaying the menu, adding a student grade, or calculating the average grade.\n\nThe `main` function runs the program in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit. It displays the menu, gets the user's choice, and calls the corresponding function to perform the desired action.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1.  Adding a student grade:\n\n    *   Enter student name: John\n    *   Enter student grade: 90\n    *   Grade added for John\n2.  Removing a student grade:\n\n    *   Enter student name: John\n    *   Grade removed for John\n3.  Updating a student grade:\n\n    *   Enter student name: John\n    *   Enter new grade: 95\n    *   Grade updated for John\n4.  Calculating the average grade:\n\n    *   Average grade: 92.50\n5.  Displaying a student grade:\n\n    *   Enter student name: John\n    *   Grade for John: 95.0\n\nNote",
