  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operation based on operator.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to use for the operation. Can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'\")\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n* The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operator as input, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, and returns the result.\n* The function uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operator.\n* It also includes error checking to prevent division by zero and to handle invalid operators.\n* The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n* The program uses a try-except block to catch and handle any errors that may occur.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Add two numbers: `calculate(5, 3, '+')` returns `8`\n* Subtract two numbers: `calculate(10, 4, '-')` returns `6`\n* Multiply two numbers: `calculate(7, 2, '*')` returns `14`\n* Divide two numbers: `calculate(9, 3, '/')` returns `3`",
