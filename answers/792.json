  "answer": "**Median Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the median of a given list of numbers. The median is the middle value in a sorted list. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        median = numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values\n    else:\n        median = (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n\n    return median\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    print(f\"The median of {numbers} is {median}\")\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    print(f\"The median of {numbers} is {median}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_median` function takes a list of numbers as input, sorts it in ascending order, and calculates the median.\n2. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value.\n3. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_median` function with two example lists.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the median of a list of exam scores to determine the average performance of a class.\n* Finding the median of a list of prices to determine the average cost of a product.\n* Calculating the median of a list of temperatures to determine the average temperature of a region.",
