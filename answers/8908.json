  "answer": "**Missing Number Finder Program**\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven a list of consecutive numbers, find the missing number in the sequence.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a list of consecutive numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of consecutive numbers with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the sum of the first and last numbers in the complete sequence\n    n = len(num_list) + 1\n    total_sum = (n * (num_list[0] + num_list[-1])) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the given numbers\n    given_sum = sum(num_list)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the given sum\n    missing_number = total_sum - given_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(num_list)\n    print(f\"The missing number in the sequence is: {missing_number}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `find_missing_number` function takes a list of consecutive numbers as input and returns the missing number.\n*   It calculates the sum of the first and last numbers in the complete sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(n * (a1 + an)) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a1` is the first term, and `an` is the last term.\n*   It calculates the sum of the given numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n*   The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the given sum.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `find_missing_number` function with an example list.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Find the missing number in the sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`. The output will be `4`.\n*   Find the missing number in the sequence: `[10, 11, 12, 14, 15]`. The output will be `13`.",
