  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's name and grade as input and uses if/else statements to determine their eligibility for a scholarship (e.g., based on grade).",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to determine scholarship eligibility\ndef check_scholarship_eligibility(name, grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a student is eligible for a scholarship based on their grade.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The student's name.\n        grade (float): The student's grade (out of 100).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the student is eligible for a scholarship, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the grade is within the valid range (0-100)\n    if grade < 0 or grade > 100:\n        return False\n\n    # Define the scholarship eligibility criteria\n    # For this example, we'll assume a student needs a grade of 85 or higher to be eligible\n    if grade >= 85:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\n# Define a main function to get user input and display the result\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's name and grade from the user\n    name = input(\"Please enter the student's name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            grade = float(input(\"Please enter the student's grade (out of 100): \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Check the student's eligibility for a scholarship\n    eligible = check_scholarship_eligibility(name, grade)\n\n    # Display the result\n    if eligible:\n        print(f\"Congratulations, {name}! You are eligible for a scholarship with a grade of {grade}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, {name}. You are not eligible for a scholarship with a grade of {grade}.\")\n\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_scholarship_eligibility` function takes a student's name and grade as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are eligible for a scholarship.\n*   The function checks if the grade is within the valid range (0-100) and returns `False` if it's not.\n*   It then checks if the grade is 85 or higher, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.\n*   The `main` function gets the student's name and grade from the user, checks their eligibility using the `check_scholarship_eligibility` function, and displays the result.\n*   The program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input for the grade, ensuring that the user is prompted to enter a valid number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   A student with a name \"John Doe\" and a grade of 90 would be eligible for a scholarship.\n*   A student with a name \"Jane Doe\" and a grade of 80 would not be eligible for a scholarship.\n*   A student with an invalid grade, such as -10 or 110, would not be eligible for a scholarship.\n\nYou can run the program, enter a student's name and grade, and see the result to test its functionality.",
