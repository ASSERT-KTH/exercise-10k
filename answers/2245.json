  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n    return length * width\n\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the area\n        area = calculate_area(length, width)\n        print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_area` function takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.\n2. It checks if the length and width are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The `main` function gets the length and width from the user, calculates the area using the `calculate_area` function, and prints the result.\n4. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers), it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nThe area of the rectangle is 15.0 square units.\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter valid input (i.e., positive numbers). If you want to add more robust error handling, you can modify the program to handle other types of invalid input.",
