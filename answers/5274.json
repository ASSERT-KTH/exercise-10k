  "answer": "**Tic-Tac-Toe Winner Determination Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program determines the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using conditional statements. The game board is represented as a 3x3 matrix, where 'X' and 'O' represent the players' moves.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef determine_winner(board):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.\n\n    Args:\n        board (list): 3x3 matrix representing the game board.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The winner of the game ('X' or 'O'), or 'Tie' if the game is a tie.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check rows for a win\n    for row in board:\n        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] != ' ':\n            return row[0]\n\n    # Check columns for a win\n    for col in range(3):\n        if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == board[2][col] != ' ':\n            return board[0][col]\n\n    # Check diagonals for a win\n    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] != ' ':\n        return board[0][0]\n    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] != ' ':\n        return board[0][2]\n\n    # Check for a tie\n    for row in board:\n        if ' ' in row:\n            return None  # Game is not over yet\n\n    return 'Tie'\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the Tic-Tac-Toe game board.\n\n    Args:\n        board (list): 3x3 matrix representing the game board.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in board:\n        print(' | '.join(row))\n        print('---------')\n\ndef main():\n    # Example game board\n    board = [\n        ['X', 'O', ' '],\n        [' ', 'X', 'O'],\n        ['O', ' ', 'X']\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Game Board:\")\n    print_board(board)\n\n    winner = determine_winner(board)\n    if winner == 'X' or winner == 'O':\n        print(f\"Player {winner} wins!\")\n    elif winner == 'Tie':\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Game is not over yet.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `determine_winner` function checks for a win by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board.\n2. If a win is found, the function returns the winner ('X' or 'O').\n3. If no win is found, the function checks for a tie by examining the game board for any empty spaces.\n4. If the game is a tie, the function returns 'Tie'.\n5. If the game is not over yet, the function returns `None`.\n6. The `print_board` function prints the Tic-Tac-Toe game board.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `determine_winner` and `print_board` functions.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Determine the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a winning row:\n```python\nboard = [\n    ['X', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', ' ']\n]\nwinner = determine_winner(board)\nprint(winner)  # Output: X\n```\n* Determine the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a winning column:\n```python\nboard = [\n    ['X', 'O', ' '],\n    ['X', 'O', ' '],\n    ['X', ' ', ' ']\n]\nwinner = determine_winner(board)\nprint(winner)  # Output: X\n```\n* Determine the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a winning diagonal:\n```python\nboard = [\n    ['X', 'O', ' '],\n    ['O', 'X', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', 'X']\n]\nwinner = determine_winner(board)\nprint(winner)  # Output: X\n```",
