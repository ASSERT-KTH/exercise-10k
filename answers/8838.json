  "prompt": "Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, a person is eligible to vote if they are 18 years or older.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for a person's age and determines whether they are eligible to vote.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask for the person's age\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n    # Check if the input is a valid integer\n    try:\n        age = int(age)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n        return\n\n    # Check if the person is eligible to vote\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    check_voting_eligibility()\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `check_voting_eligibility` function asks the user for their age.\n2. It checks if the input is a valid integer. If not, it displays an error message and returns.\n3. If the input is a valid integer, it checks if the age is 18 or older. If so, it prints out that the person is eligible to vote. Otherwise, it prints out that they are not eligible to vote.\n4. The `main` function calls the `check_voting_eligibility` function.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* A person who is 18 years old or older will see the message \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* A person who is under 18 years old will see the message \"You are not eligible to vote.\"\n* If a user enters something that is not a valid age (e.g., a string or a special character), they will see the message \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\"",
