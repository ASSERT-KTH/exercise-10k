  "answer": "**Course Scheduling Program**\n\n### Introduction\nThis program helps students schedule courses by considering factors such as course availability, time conflicts, and prerequisites. The program uses conditional statements to ensure that students can only enroll in courses that meet these requirements.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store course information\ncourses = {\n    \"Math 101\": {\"available\": True, \"time\": \"Monday 10:00 AM\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n    \"Math 102\": {\"available\": True, \"time\": \"Tuesday 11:00 AM\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Math 101\"]},\n    \"Science 101\": {\"available\": True, \"time\": \"Wednesday 2:00 PM\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n    \"Science 102\": {\"available\": True, \"time\": \"Thursday 3:00 PM\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Science 101\"]},\n    \"English 101\": {\"available\": True, \"time\": \"Monday 10:00 AM\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n}\n\n# Define a dictionary to store student schedules\nstudent_schedules = {}\n\ndef schedule_course(student_name, course_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Schedules a course for a student.\n\n    Args:\n        student_name (str): The name of the student.\n        course_name (str): The name of the course.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the course is scheduled successfully, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if course_name not in courses:\n        print(f\"Error: {course_name} is not available.\")\n        return False\n\n    if not courses[course_name][\"available\"]:\n        print(f\"Error: {course_name} is not available.\")\n        return False\n\n    if course_name in student_schedules.get(student_name, []):\n        print(f\"Error: You are already enrolled in {course_name}.\")\n        return False\n\n    for scheduled_course in student_schedules.get(student_name, []):\n        if courses[scheduled_course][\"time\"] == courses[course_name][\"time\"]:\n            print(f\"Error: Time conflict with {scheduled_course}.\")\n            return False\n\n    for prerequisite in courses[course_name][\"prerequisites\"]:\n        if prerequisite not in student_schedules.get(student_name, []):\n            print(f\"Error: You need to take {prerequisite} before taking {course_name}.\")\n            return False\n\n    if student_name not in student_schedules:\n        student_schedules[student_name] = []\n\n    student_schedules[student_name].append(course_name)\n    print(f\"Success: {course_name} has been scheduled for {student_name}.\")\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nCourse Scheduling Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Schedule a course\")\n        print(\"2. View student schedule\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            student_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n            course_name = input(\"Enter the course name: \")\n            schedule_course(student_name, course_name)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            student_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n            if student_name in student_schedules:\n                print(f\"\\n{student_name}'s Schedule:\")\n                for course in student_schedules[student_name]:\n                    print(course)\n            else:\n                print(f\"Error: {student_name} has no scheduled courses.\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to schedule a course.\n2. Enter your name and the course name you want to schedule.\n3. The program will check if the course is available, if there are any time conflicts, and if you have met the prerequisites.\n4. If you meet all the requirements, the course will be scheduled and a success message will be displayed.\n5. You can view your schedule by selecting option 2.\n\n### Notes\n* This program uses a simple dictionary to store course information and student schedules.\n* The `schedule_course` function checks for course availability, time conflicts, and prerequisites before scheduling a course.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for students to schedule courses and view their schedules.",
