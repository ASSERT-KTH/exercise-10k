  "prompt": "Write a program that checks a bank account balance and prints 'Low Balance' if the balance is below a certain threshold (e.g., $100), otherwise prints 'Sufficient Balance'",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that implements this functionality:\n\n```python\ndef check_balance(balance, threshold=100):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the bank account balance and prints 'Low Balance' if the balance is below a certain threshold,\n    otherwise prints 'Sufficient Balance'.\n\n    Args:\n        balance (float): The current bank account balance.\n        threshold (float, optional): The minimum balance required to avoid 'Low Balance' message. Defaults to 100.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if balance < threshold:\n        print(\"Low Balance\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sufficient Balance\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    balance = float(input(\"Enter your bank account balance: $\"))\n    check_balance(balance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n*   The `check_balance` function takes two arguments: `balance` and `threshold`. The `threshold` argument has a default value of $100.\n*   Inside the function, a conditional statement checks if the `balance` is less than the `threshold`. If true, it prints \"Low Balance.\"\n*   Otherwise, it prints \"Sufficient Balance.\"\n*   The `main` function asks the user for their bank account balance, converts it to a float, and then calls `check_balance` with the provided balance.\n*   You can adjust the threshold value as needed when calling the `check_balance` function.\n\n**How to run the program**:\n\n1.  Save the code in a file, for example, `balance_checker.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program by typing `python balance_checker.py` and pressing Enter.\n4.  When prompted, enter your bank account balance, and the program will print \"Low Balance\" or \"Sufficient Balance\" based on the threshold.",
