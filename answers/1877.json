  "answer": "Here's a Python program to search for multiple elements in an array and print their indices if found:\n\n```python\ndef search_elements(array, elements):\n    \"\"\"\n    Search for multiple elements in an array and print their indices if found.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array to search in.\n        elements (list): The list of elements to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for element in elements:\n        indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(array) if x == element]\n        if indices:\n            print(f\"Element '{element}' found at indices: {indices}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Element '{element}' not found in the array.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3]\n    elements = [2, 3, 10]\n    search_elements(array, elements)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1.  We define a function `search_elements` that takes an `array` and a list of `elements` as input.\n2.  We iterate through each `element` in the `elements` list.\n3.  For each `element`, we use list comprehension to find its indices in the `array` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and value of each element.\n4.  If the `element` is found (i.e., `indices` is not empty), we print its indices.\n5.  If the `element` is not found, we print a corresponding message.\n6.  In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `search_elements` with an example `array` and `elements` list.\n\nYou can modify the `array` and `elements` lists in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
