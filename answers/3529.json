  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n\n    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        # Calculate the next term as the sum of the previous two terms\n        next_term = fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2]\n        # Append the next term to the sequence\n        fib_sequence.append(next_term)\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10  # Change this to generate a sequence of a different length\nfib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\nprint(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n---------------------------\n\n1.  The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2.  It handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, returning an empty list, a list with one term (0), or a list with two terms (0, 1), respectively.\n3.  For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0, 1).\n4.  The program then uses a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. In each iteration, it calculates the next term as the sum of the previous two terms and appends it to the sequence.\n5.  Finally, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nFor `n = 10`, the output will be:\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
