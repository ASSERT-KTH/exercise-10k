  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Implementation in Python**\n==========================================\n\nBelow is an example implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using nested for loops in Python.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to be sorted.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:\n                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]\n    \n    return lst\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test the bubble sort function\n    unsorted_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Unsorted List:\", unsorted_list)\n    sorted_list = bubble_sort(unsorted_list)\n    print(\"Sorted List:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list as input and sorts it in ascending order.\n2.  It uses two nested for loops to compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n3.  The outer loop (`for i in range(n)`) iterates over each element in the list, while the inner loop (`for j in range(0, n - i - 1)`) compares each pair of adjacent elements.\n4.  If an element is found to be greater than the next element, they are swapped using tuple assignment (`lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]`).\n5.  This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it less efficient for large datasets compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, which have average time complexities of O(n log n). However, bubble sort can be useful for small datasets or educational purposes due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.",
