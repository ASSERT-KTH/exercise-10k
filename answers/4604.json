  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Parameters:\n    length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n    width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle\n    area = length * width\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    \n    return area, perimeter\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area, perimeter = rectangle_properties(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Area: {area}\")\n    print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `rectangle_properties` function calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.\n*   The area of the rectangle is calculated as `length * width`.\n*   The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as `2 * (length + width)`.\n*   The `main` function gets the length and width from the user, calls the `rectangle_properties` function, and prints the results.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. After entering the values, it will display the calculated area and perimeter.\n\nFor example, if you enter a length of 5 and a width of 3, the output will be:\n\n```\nArea: 15.0\nPerimeter: 16.0\n```",
