The `add_student` method adds a student to the gradebook, the `add_grade` method adds a grade to a student's list of grades, and the `calculate_average` method calculates the average grade for a student. The `display_gradebook` method displays the current state of the gradebook.\n\nThe `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the gradebook. It prompts the user to choose an option and performs the corresponding action.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the menu prompts. You can add students, add grades, calculate average grades, display the gradebook, or quit the program.",
