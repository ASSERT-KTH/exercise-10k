  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a series of numbers, calculates the average, and prints out the result.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the average of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for a series of numbers, calculates the average, and prints out the result.\"\"\"\n    numbers = []\n    \n    # Ask the user for numbers until they decide to stop\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        \n        if user_input.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        \n        try:\n            number = float(user_input)\n            numbers.append(number)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'q' to quit.\")\n    \n    # Check if the user entered any numbers\n    if not numbers:\n        print(\"No numbers entered. Cannot calculate average.\")\n    else:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"Average: {average:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a series of numbers, one at a time, when prompted.\n3. Enter 'q' to quit entering numbers.\n4. The program will calculate and print out the average of the numbers.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input until they decide to quit.\n* The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n* The program handles invalid input (e.g., non-numeric characters) by printing an error message and prompting the user again.\n* The average is printed out with two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.",
