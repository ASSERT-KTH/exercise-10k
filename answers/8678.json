  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user, keeps track of the score, and announces the winner after a set number of rounds.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Importing the random module\nimport random\n\n# Defining the choices\nchoices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n\n# Defining the beats dictionary\nbeats = {\n    'rock': 'scissors',\n    'paper': 'rock',\n    'scissors': 'paper'\n}\n\n# Defining the score variables\nuser_score = 0\ncomputer_score = 0\n\n# Defining the rounds variable\nrounds = 5\n\n# Defining the play_game function\ndef play_game():\n    global user_score, computer_score\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    for i in range(rounds):\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n        print(f\"Computer chose {computer_choice}\")\n        if beats[user_choice] == computer_choice:\n            user_score += 1\n            print(\"You win this round!\")\n        elif beats[computer_choice] == user_choice:\n            computer_score += 1\n            print(\"Computer wins this round!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"It's a tie!\")\n        print(f\"Score: You {user_score}, Computer {computer_score}\\n\")\n    print(\"Game over!\")\n    if user_score > computer_score:\n        print(\"You win!\")\n    elif computer_score > user_score:\n        print(\"Computer wins!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's a tie game!\")\n\n# Calling the play_game function\nplay_game()\n```\nNote that I added a `global` statement to the `play_game` function to modify the global `user_score` and `computer_score` variables. I also added some extra print statements to make the game more user-friendly. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!",
