  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the difference between two integers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first integer.\n        num2 (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(num1 - num2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Take two integers as input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the difference\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is: {difference}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program defines a function `calculate_difference` that calculates the absolute difference between two integers using the `abs` function.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter two integers using the `input` function and converts the input to integers using the `int` function.\n*   The program then calls the `calculate_difference` function with the user-input integers and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Input: `num1 = 10`, `num2 = 5`\n    Output: `The difference between 10 and 5 is: 5`\n*   Input: `num1 = -5`, `num2 = 10`\n    Output: `The difference between -5 and 10 is: 15`",
