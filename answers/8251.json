  "answer": "**Bank Transaction Simulator**\n================================\n\nThis program simulates a bank transaction by allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. It uses if/else statements to handle different user inputs and validate transactions.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initial balance: $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Transaction Simulator\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Deposit**: Enter `1` to deposit money into your account. Enter a positive value to deposit.\n2. **Withdraw**: Enter `2` to withdraw money from your account. Enter a positive value that does not exceed your current balance.\n3. **Check Balance**: Enter `3` to view your current account balance.\n4. **Exit**: Enter `4` to exit the program.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program creates a `BankAccount` object with an initial balance of $1000.\n2. The `main` function runs a loop that displays a menu of options to the user.\n3. Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding method:\n\t* `deposit`: adds the specified amount to the account balance.\n\t* `withdraw`: subtracts the specified amount from the account balance if sufficient funds are available.\n\t* `check_balance`: displays the current account balance.\n4. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.\n5. The program exits when the user chooses to exit (option 4).",
