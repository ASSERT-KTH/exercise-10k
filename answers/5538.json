  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing a Tuple Variable\n#### Code\n```python\n# Declare a tuple variable and assign values to it\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(\"Tuple values:\", my_tuple)\n\n# Print individual values\nprint(\"First value:\", my_tuple[0])\nprint(\"Last value:\", my_tuple[-1])\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n* We declare a tuple variable `my_tuple` and assign it five integer values.\n* We use the `print()` function to display the entire tuple.\n* We access individual values in the tuple using indexing. The first value is at index 0, and the last value can be accessed using a negative index (-1).\n\n#### Output\n```\nTuple values: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nFirst value: 1\nLast value: 5\n```\n\n#### Advice\n* Tuples in Python are immutable, meaning you cannot modify their values after creation.\n* Tuples are useful for storing collections of values that should not be changed, such as constants or data that should remain consistent throughout the program.",
