  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that counts down from a given number and prints each number on a new line:\n\n```python\ndef count_down(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts down from n and prints each number on a new line.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to start counting down from.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\ncount_down(10)\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- The `count_down` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n- The `for` loop uses the `range` function to generate numbers from `n` down to 1.\n- The `range` function takes three arguments: the start number, the stop number, and the step size. In this case, the start number is `n`, the stop number is 1 (but not included, so we use 0), and the step size is -1 to count down.\n- Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to print each number on a new line.\n- Finally, we call the `count_down` function with the argument `10` to start the countdown.",
