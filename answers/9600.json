  "answer": "**Quiz Program in Python**\n=====================================\n\nThis program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"Answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"Answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest mammal on Earth?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Blue whale\",\n        \"B\": \"Fin whale\",\n        \"C\": \"Humpback whale\",\n        \"D\": \"Sperm whale\",\n        \"Answer\": \"A\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Ask the user each question\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"Answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"Answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {options['Answer']}.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n\n# Run the quiz\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by entering the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n4. After all questions have been asked, the program will print your final score.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `questions` with each key being a question and each value being another dictionary with options and the correct answer.\n2. The `quiz` function initializes the score to 0 and then asks the user each question.\n3. For each question, the program prints the question and options, asks the user for their answer, and checks whether the answer is correct.\n4. If the answer is correct, the program increments the score and prints a success message. If the answer is incorrect, the program prints an error message with the correct answer.\n5. After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score.",
