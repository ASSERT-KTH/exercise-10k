  "answer": "**Cone Surface Area Calculator**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cone given its radius and height.\n\n### Formula\nThe surface area of a cone is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 + \\pi r \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the surface area\n- \\( r \\) is the radius\n- \\( h \\) is the height\n- \\( \\pi \\) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cone_surface_area(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cone.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cone.\n        height (float): The height of the cone.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cone.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    slant_height = math.sqrt(radius**2 + height**2)\n    surface_area = math.pi * radius**2 + math.pi * radius * slant_height\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cone: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cone: \"))\n\n    # Calculate surface area\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cone_surface_area(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cone is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius and height of the cone when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the surface area of the cone.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` library for mathematical operations and follows standard professional guidelines for code structure and documentation.",
