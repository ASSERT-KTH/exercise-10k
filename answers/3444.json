  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a bank transaction, where the user can deposit or withdraw money, and the program prints the updated balance",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that simulates a bank transaction system:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient balance.\")\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Transaction Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n2. The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` object with an initial balance of $1000 and presents a menu for the user to interact with.\n3. The user can choose to deposit, withdraw, check the balance, or exit the program.\n4. Based on the user's choice, the program prompts for the relevant input (e.g., deposit amount) and performs the corresponding action.\n5. The program updates the balance and prints the result after each transaction.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n* Deposit $500: Choose option 1, enter `500` as the deposit amount, and the program will print the updated balance.\n* Withdraw $200: Choose option 2, enter `200` as the withdrawal amount, and the program will print the updated balance.\n* Check balance: Choose option 3, and the program will print the current balance.",
