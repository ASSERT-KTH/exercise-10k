  "answer": "**Bank Account Management Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program simulates a simple bank account management system with loan features. It uses an if/else statement to manage user input and perform actions based on the user's choice.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n        self.loan = 0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def take_loan(self, amount):\n        self.loan += amount\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Took loan of ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def repay_loan(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds to repay loan.\")\n        elif amount > self.loan:\n            print(\"Repayment amount exceeds outstanding loan.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            self.loan -= amount\n            print(f\"Repaid ${amount:.2f} of loan. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}, Outstanding loan: ${self.loan:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Take Loan\")\n        print(\"4. Repay Loan\")\n        print(\"5. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"6. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to take as loan: \"))\n            account.take_loan(amount)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to repay loan: \"))\n            account.repay_loan(amount)\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.balance:.2f}, Outstanding loan: ${account.loan:.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"6\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Deposit**: Enter `1` to deposit an amount. The program will add the amount to the current balance and display the updated balance.\n2. **Withdraw**: Enter `2` to withdraw an amount. The program will check if the amount exceeds the current balance and display an error message if so.\n3. **Take Loan**: Enter `3` to take a loan. The program will add the loan amount to the current balance and update the outstanding loan amount.\n4. **Repay Loan**: Enter `4` to repay a loan. The program will check if the repayment amount exceeds the current balance or the outstanding loan amount and display an error message if so.\n5. **Check Balance**: Enter `5` to view the current balance and outstanding loan amount.\n6. **Exit**: Enter `6` to exit the program.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance and loan features. The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program.",
