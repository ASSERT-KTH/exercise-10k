  "prompt": "Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program should first ask the user to choose the operation they want to perform, then ask for the two numbers, and finally display the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define a function for each arithmetic operation\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n    else:\n        return x / y\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    # Ask the user to choose an operation\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the two numbers\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Perform the chosen operation and display the result\n    if choice == '1':\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program first defines four functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) for each arithmetic operation. These functions take two numbers as input and return the result of the operation.\n*   The `main` function serves as the program's entry point. It prompts the user to choose an operation, asks for the two numbers, and then performs the chosen operation using the corresponding function.\n*   The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid choice (a number between 1 and 4) and valid numbers (float values).\n*   Finally, it displays the result of the operation using an f-string, which allows for easy formatting of the output string.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   To perform addition: Choose operation 1, enter two numbers (e.g., 5 and 3), and the program will display the result (5 + 3 = 8.0).\n*   To perform subtraction: Choose operation 2, enter two numbers (e.g., 10 and 4), and the program will display the result (10 - 4 = 6.0).\n*   To perform multiplication: Choose operation 3, enter two numbers (e.g., 7 and 2), and the program will display the result (7 \\* 2 = 14.0).\n*   To perform division: Choose operation 4, enter two numbers (e.g., 9 and 3), and the program will display the result (9 / 3 = 3.0). If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.",
