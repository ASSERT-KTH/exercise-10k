  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with HTML entities encoded.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to encode HTML entities in a given string. This will involve creating a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with HTML entities encoded. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nimport html\n\ndef encode_html_entities(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the string with HTML entities encoded.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to be encoded.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The input string with HTML entities encoded.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we import the html module which has a function called escape() that can be used to encode HTML entities.\n    \n    # Now, we define our function encode_html_entities that takes a string as input.\n    \n    # We use the html.escape() function to replace special characters with their corresponding HTML entities.\n    encoded_string = html.escape(input_string)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the encoded string.\n    return encoded_string\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(encode_html_entities(\"<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `html.escape()` function is used to replace special characters with their corresponding HTML entities. This function is part of Python's standard library, making it a convenient choice for encoding HTML entities.\n* The `encode_html_entities` function takes an input string, applies the `html.escape()` function to it, and returns the resulting encoded string.\n* In the example usage, the function is called with a string containing HTML tags, and the output is printed to demonstrate the encoding of HTML entities.\n* The `html.escape()` function replaces special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., with their corresponding HTML entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, etc.",
