  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function to remove an item from a dictionary by its key, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef delete_item_by_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes an item from a dictionary by its key.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which to delete the item.\n        key (any): The key of the item to be deleted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The updated dictionary after deletion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the key exists in the dictionary\n    if key in dictionary:\n        \n        # If the key exists, we can use the pop() method to remove it from the dictionary\n        # The pop() method removes and returns the value of the item with the specified key\n        dictionary.pop(key)\n        \n        # After deleting the item, we return the updated dictionary\n        return dictionary\n    \n    # If the key does not exist in the dictionary, we return a message indicating that\n    else:\n        print(f\"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n        return dictionary\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2, \"cherry\": 3}\nprint(delete_item_by_key(my_dict, \"banana\"))  # Output: {'apple': 1, 'cherry': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `delete_item_by_key` checks if a given `key` exists in the `dictionary` using the `in` operator. If the key is found, it proceeds to delete the item.\n* The `pop()` method is used to remove the item with the specified `key` from the `dictionary`. This method not only removes the item but also returns its value.\n* If the `key` does not exist in the `dictionary`, the function prints a message indicating that the key was not found and returns the original `dictionary`.\n* The function returns the updated `dictionary` after the deletion process, allowing for further operations or checks on the modified dictionary.",
