  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition, making it easier to combine and reuse code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compose(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.\n    \n    The composition of two functions f and g is a new function that applies g first and then applies f to the result.\n    \n    Args:\n        f (function): The first function to be applied in the composition.\n        g (function): The second function to be applied in the composition.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We want to create a new function that represents the composition of f and g\n    # This new function will take one argument, x\n    \n    # Define a new function that takes one argument, x\n    def composed_function(x):\n        \n        # First, we apply g to x\n        # This is because in the composition of f and g, g is applied first\n        intermediate_result = g(x)\n        \n        # Then, we apply f to the result of g(x)\n        # This is the final step in the composition of f and g\n        final_result = f(intermediate_result)\n        \n        # Return the final result\n        return final_result\n    \n    # Return the new function that represents the composition of f and g\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n# Create a new function that is the composition of double and add_one\ndouble_then_add_one = compose(double, add_one)\n\n# Test the new function\nprint(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose` function takes two functions `f` and `g` as arguments and returns a new function `composed_function` that represents their composition. This new function applies `g` first and then applies `f` to the result.\n* Within `composed_function`, the `g` function is applied to the input `x` and stored in `intermediate_result`. Then, the `f` function is applied to `intermediate_result` and stored in `final_result`.\n* The `composed_function` returns `final_result`, which is the output of the composition of `f` and `g`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to create a new function `double_then_add_one` by composing the `double` and `add_one` functions using the `compose` function.",
