  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n#### Overview\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check for negative input\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function with an example input and handles any potential errors.",
