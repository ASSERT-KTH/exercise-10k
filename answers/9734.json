  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period (in years).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** time - principal\n    return compound_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nThe compound interest is: $102.5\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes the principal, rate, and time as input and calculates the compound interest using the formula: `A = P * (1 + r)^t`, where `A` is the amount after `t` years, `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period. The compound interest is then calculated as `A - P`.\n2. The `main` function gets the user input, calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function, and prints the result.\n3. The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the program logic and a `calculate_compound_interest` function to perform the calculation. This makes the code more modular and reusable.",
