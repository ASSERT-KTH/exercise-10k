  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\n# Get the two integers from the user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the sum\nsum = num1 + num2\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum)\n```\n\nLet me explain what this code does:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get input from the user. The `int()` function is used to convert the input into an integer, because `input()` returns a string by default.\n2. The two integers are stored in the variables `num1` and `num2`.\n3. The sum of `num1` and `num2` is calculated and stored in the variable `sum`.\n4. Finally, the sum is printed to the console along with a message indicating which two numbers were added together.\n\nYou can also write this program as a function:\n\n```python\ndef add_two_numbers():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n    sum = num1 + num2\n    print(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum)\n\nadd_two_numbers()\n```\n\nOr, if you want to make it reusable and able to add any two numbers, not just the ones entered by the user:\n\n```python\ndef add_two_numbers(a, b):\n    sum = a + b\n    print(\"The sum of\", a, \"and\", b, \"is\", sum)\n\nadd_two_numbers(5, 7)\n```",
