  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a word as input from the user, scrambles the letters, and asks the user to unscramble the word.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles the letters of the input word.\n    \n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to scramble.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef check_answer(scrambled_word, original_word, user_answer):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the user's answer matches the original word.\n    \n    Args:\n        scrambled_word (str): The scrambled word.\n        original_word (str): The original word.\n        user_answer (str): The user's answer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the user's answer is correct, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return user_answer.lower() == original_word.lower()\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the word from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    \n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    \n    # Print the scrambled word\n    print(f\"Unscramble the letters: {scrambled_word}\")\n    \n    # Get the user's answer\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    \n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    if check_answer(scrambled_word, word, user_answer):\n        print(\"Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed\", word)\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list using the `random.shuffle` function, and then joins the list back into a string.\n2. The `check_answer` function takes the scrambled word, the original word, and the user's answer as input, and returns True if the user's answer matches the original word (case-insensitive), and False otherwise.\n3. The `main` function gets a word from the user, scrambles it using the `scramble_word` function, prints the scrambled word, gets the user's answer, and checks if the answer is correct using the `check_answer` function. If the answer is correct, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints an error message with the correct answer.",
