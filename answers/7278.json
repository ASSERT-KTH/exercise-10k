  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the grade scale\ngrade_scale = {\n    'A': range(90, 101),\n    'B': range(80, 90),\n    'C': range(70, 80),\n    'D': range(60, 70),\n    'F': range(0, 60)\n}\n\n# Get the student's score\nscore = int(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n# Check the score against the grade scale\nfor grade, score_range in grade_scale.items():\n    if score in score_range:\n        print(f\"The student's grade is {grade}.\")\n        break\n```\nThis code defines the grade scale as a dictionary, gets the student's score from the user, checks the score against the grade scale, and prints out the corresponding grade.\n\nNote that I used the `range` function to define the score ranges for each grade, and the `in` operator to check if the score is within a particular range. I also used an `f` string to format the output message with the grade.\n\nAlso, I used the `break` statement to exit the loop once the grade is found, to avoid unnecessary iterations.",
