  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the simple interest on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the simple interest on a loan.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount of the loan.\n        rate (float): The interest rate of the loan.\n        time (float): The time period of the loan in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest on the loan.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the interest rate from percentage to decimal\n    rate = rate / 100\n\n    # Calculate the simple interest using the formula: simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n\n    return simple_interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Calculate the total amount\n    total_amount = principal + simple_interest\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Simple Interest: ${simple_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Calculate the simple interest on a loan of $1000 with an interest rate of 10% for 5 years.\n2. Calculate the simple interest on a loan of $5000 with an interest rate of 8% for 3 years.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the program in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `simple_interest.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program by typing `python simple_interest.py`.\n4. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted.\n5. The program will calculate and display the simple interest and total amount.",
