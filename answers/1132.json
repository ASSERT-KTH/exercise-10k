  "answer": "**Text Analysis Program**\n=========================\n\nThis program takes a piece of text as input and analyzes its content, including word frequency and sentiment.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Python 3.8+\n* `nltk` library for natural language processing\n* `vaderSentiment` library for sentiment analysis\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\n# Initialize NLTK data\nnltk.download('vader_lexicon')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze the content of the input text.\n\n    Args:\n    text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the analysis results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text).lower()\n\n    # Tokenize the text into words\n    words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)\n\n    # Remove stopwords\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]\n\n    # Calculate word frequency\n    word_freq = Counter(words)\n\n    # Calculate sentiment\n    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the analysis results\n    analysis_results = {\n        'word_frequency': dict(word_freq.most_common(10)),  # Top 10 most frequent words\n        'sentiment': sentiment\n    }\n\n    return analysis_results\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter a piece of text: \")\n    analysis_results = analyze_text(text)\n\n    print(\"Analysis Results:\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n    print(\"Word Frequency:\")\n    for word, freq in analysis_results['word_frequency'].items():\n        print(f\"{word}: {freq}\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Sentiment:\")\n    print(f\"Positive: {analysis_results['sentiment']['pos']:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Neutral: {analysis_results['sentiment']['neu']:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Negative: {analysis_results['sentiment']['neg']:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound: {analysis_results['sentiment']['compound']:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter a piece of text when prompted.\n2. The program will analyze the text and display the top 10 most frequent words and their frequencies.\n3. The program will also display the sentiment analysis results, including the positive, neutral, and negative scores, as well as the compound score.\n\n### Note\n\n* The `vaderSentiment` library uses a rule-based approach to sentiment analysis, which may not always produce accurate results.\n* The `nltk` library requires a significant amount of memory to store its data, so it may not be suitable for large-scale text analysis tasks.\n* This program is for educational purposes only and should not be used for production-level text analysis tasks.",
