  "prompt": "Write a program to divide two numbers and print the quotient and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that divides two numbers and prints the quotient and remainder:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n# Get the numbers from the user\ndividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\ndivisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n# Check for division by zero\nif divisor == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\nelse:\n    quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n```\n\nThis program uses the floor division operator `//` to get the quotient and the modulus operator `%` to get the remainder. It also includes a check to prevent division by zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.",
