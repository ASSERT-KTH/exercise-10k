  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence Function**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following function uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    - int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position.\n    lengths = [1] * len(nums)\n\n    # Iterate over the list to fill the lengths list.\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If the current number is greater than the previous number, update the length of the subsequence.\n            if nums[i] > nums[j]:\n                lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], lengths[j] + 1)\n\n    # Return the maximum length found.\n    return max(lengths)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\n    print(\"Length of the longest increasing subsequence:\", longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize a list `lengths` with the same length as the input list `nums`, where each element is set to 1. This represents the minimum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position.\n2.  Iterate over the list `nums` from the second element to the end.\n3.  For each element, compare it with all previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element, update the length of the subsequence ending at the current position if necessary.\n4.  After filling the `lengths` list, return the maximum length found, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because there are two nested loops iterating over the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because an additional list of the same length is used to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences.",
