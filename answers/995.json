  "prompt": "Write a program that converts a numerical grade to a letter grade. The program uses if-else statements to determine the letter grade based on the numerical grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int grade;\n    char letter;\n    cout << \"Enter your grade: \";\n    cin >> grade;\n\n    if (grade >= 90) {\n        letter = 'A';\n    } else if (grade >= 80 && grade < 90) {\n        letter = 'B';\n    } else if (grade >= 70 && grade < 80) {\n        letter = 'C';\n    } else if (grade >= 60 && grade < 70) {\n        letter = 'D';\n    } else {\n        letter = 'F';\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Your letter grade is: \" << letter << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined, including:\n\n1. Including the `iostream` header file for input/output operations.\n2. Using the `std` namespace to avoid having to prefix standard library functions with `std::`.\n3. Declaring two variables: `grade` of type `int` and `letter` of type `char`.\n4. Prompting the user to enter their numerical grade using `cout` and reading the input using `cin`.\n5. Using an `if-else` statement to determine the letter grade based on the numerical grade.\n6. Assigning the corresponding letter grade to the `letter` variable based on the numerical grade.\n7. Printing the letter grade to the console using `cout`.\n8. Returning an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.\n\nNote that I used `char` for the `letter` variable, as it is sufficient to store a single character (the letter grade). If you need to store a string representation of the grade (e.g., \"A+\", \"B-\", etc.), you may want to use a `std::string` instead.",
