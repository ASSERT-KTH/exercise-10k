  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers and print each number.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program written in Python that uses a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers and print each number:\n\n```python\n# Define the array of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each number\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define the array**: The `numbers` variable is defined with an array of integers from 1 to 10.\n2. **For loop**: The `for` keyword is used to create a loop that iterates over the `numbers` array.\n3. **Loop variable**: The `number` variable is used to store the current element being processed in the loop.\n4. **Print statement**: Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to output the current `number` to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print each number in the array on a separate line:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\n### Alternative Implementation (JavaScript)\n\nIf you prefer JavaScript, here's an equivalent program:\n\n```javascript\n// Define the array of numbers\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\n// Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each number\nfor (let number of numbers) {\n    console.log(number);\n}\n```",
