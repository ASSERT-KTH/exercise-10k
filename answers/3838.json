  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a word as input, scrambles it, and asks the user to unscramble it.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a given word.\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n\n    answer = input(\"Your answer: \")\n    if answer.lower() == word.lower():\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how this program works:\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it into a list of characters, shuffles the list, and then joins the characters back together into a string.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a word, scrambles the word using the `scramble_word` function, and then asks the user to unscramble the word.\n3. The user's answer is compared to the original word (case-insensitive), and a message is printed indicating whether the user's answer is correct or not.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a word when prompted, and then try to unscramble the scrambled word.",
