  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a phone book. The program should take in the name and phone number and output the updated phone book based on the following conditions: if the user adds a contact, add the contact to the phone book, if the user removes a contact, remove the contact from the phone book, if the user checks the phone book, output the current phone book.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a phone book based on the conditions you specified:\n\n```python\nclass PhoneBook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.phone_book = {}\n\n    def add_contact(self, name, phone_number):\n        \"\"\"Add a contact to the phone book\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            print(f\"Contact {name} already exists. Updating phone number.\")\n        self.phone_book[name] = phone_number\n        print(f\"Contact {name} added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_contact(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Remove a contact from the phone book\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            del self.phone_book[name]\n            print(f\"Contact {name} removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Contact {name} not found in phone book.\")\n\n    def check_phone_book(self):\n        \"\"\"Print the current phone book\"\"\"\n        if not self.phone_book:\n            print(\"Phone book is empty.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Current Phone Book:\")\n            for name, phone_number in self.phone_book.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {phone_number}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    phone_book = PhoneBook()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPhone Book Options:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Contact\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Contact\")\n        print(\"3. Check Phone Book\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        option = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n        if option == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter contact name: \")\n            phone_number = input(\"Enter contact phone number: \")\n            phone_book.add_contact(name, phone_number)\n        elif option == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter contact name: \")\n            phone_book.remove_contact(name)\n        elif option == \"3\":\n            phone_book.check_phone_book()\n        elif option == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program uses a `PhoneBook` class to store contacts in a dictionary (`phone_book`).\n*   The `add_contact` method adds a contact to the phone book. If the contact already exists, it updates the phone number.\n*   The `remove_contact` method removes a contact from the phone book if the contact exists.\n*   The `check_phone_book` method prints the current phone book.\n*   The `main` function provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with the phone book.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to add a contact.\n3.  Enter the contact name and phone number.\n4.  Choose option 3 to check the phone book.\n5.  Choose option 2 to remove a contact.\n6.  Choose option 4 to quit the program.",
