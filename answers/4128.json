  "answer": "### Unique Student IDs Set\n#### Overview\nThe following Python code creates a set to store unique student IDs and then prints out the number of unique IDs.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef count_unique_student_ids(student_ids):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a set to store unique student IDs and returns the number of unique IDs.\n\n    Args:\n        student_ids (list): A list of student IDs.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of unique student IDs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a set from the list of student IDs to store unique IDs\n    unique_ids = set(student_ids)\n    \n    # Return the number of unique IDs\n    return len(unique_ids)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example list of student IDs\n    student_ids = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7]\n    \n    # Count the number of unique student IDs\n    num_unique_ids = count_unique_student_ids(student_ids)\n    \n    # Print the number of unique IDs\n    print(\"Number of unique student IDs:\", num_unique_ids)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `count_unique_student_ids` function takes a list of student IDs as input and returns the number of unique IDs.\n*   It uses a set to store unique IDs, which automatically eliminates duplicates.\n*   The `len` function is used to count the number of unique IDs in the set.\n*   In the `main` function, an example list of student IDs is provided, and the `count_unique_student_ids` function is called to count the number of unique IDs.\n*   The result is then printed to the console.\n\n#### Output\nWhen you run this code with the example list of student IDs, it will output:\n```\nNumber of unique student IDs: 7\n```",
