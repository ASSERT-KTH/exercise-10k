  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store names and phone numbers. The program should allow users to add, remove, and search for phone numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that does exactly that:\n\n```python\nclass PhoneBook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.phone_book = {}\n\n    def add_number(self):\n        \"\"\"Adds a new name and phone number to the phone book.\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name: \")\n        number = input(\"Enter the phone number: \")\n        self.phone_book[name] = number\n        print(f\"Added {name} with phone number {number}.\")\n\n    def remove_number(self):\n        \"\"\"Removes a name and phone number from the phone book.\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name to remove: \")\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            del self.phone_book[name]\n            print(f\"Removed {name}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{name} not found in phone book.\")\n\n    def search_number(self):\n        \"\"\"Searches for a phone number by name.\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name to search for: \")\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            print(f\"{name}'s phone number is {self.phone_book[name]}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{name} not found in phone book.\")\n\n    def display_phone_book(self):\n        \"\"\"Displays all names and phone numbers in the phone book.\"\"\"\n        if self.phone_book:\n            print(\"Phone Book:\")\n            for name, number in self.phone_book.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {number}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Phone book is empty.\")\n\ndef main():\n    phone_book = PhoneBook()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPhone Book Menu:\")\n        print(\"1.

It provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the phone book. The `PhoneBook` class encapsulates the data and methods for managing the phone book.",
