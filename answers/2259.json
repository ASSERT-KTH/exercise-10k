  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a value as input and returns the index of the value in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses the built-in `index()` method to find the index of a value in an array:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(array, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of a value in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        value: The value to be searched in the array.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the value in the array.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the value is not found in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the index() method to find the index of the value\n        index = array.index(value)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the value is not found, raise a ValueError with a custom message\n        raise ValueError(f\"The value {value} is not found in the array.\")\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvalue = 3\nprint(find_index(array, value))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `find_index()` that takes an array and a value as input. It uses the `index()` method to find the index of the value in the array. If the value is found, it returns the index. If the value is not found, it raises a `ValueError` with a custom message.\n\nPlease note that the `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array. If you want to find all occurrences of the value, you would need to use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension or a loop.\n\nAlso, this program assumes that the input array is a list. If you are working with a different type of array (such as a NumPy array), you may need to use a different method to find the index of the value.",
