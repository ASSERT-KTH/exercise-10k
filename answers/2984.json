  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the average of a given list of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the given list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function, and then divides by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements) to get the average. The result is returned as a float.\n\nYou can modify the `numbers` list in the example usage to test the function with different inputs.\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\nNote that this program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to divide by the length of the list. To handle this case, you can add a simple check at the beginning of the `calculate_average` function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return None  # or any other value to indicate an empty list\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can raise a custom error with a more informative message:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n```",
