  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The program should calculate and display the average grade, the highest grade, and the names of students who scored above the average grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_student_grades(student_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade, the highest grade, and the names of students who scored above the average grade.\n\n    Args:\n        student_grades (dict): A dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the average grade, the highest grade, and the names of students who scored above the average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input dictionary is empty\n    if not student_grades:\n        return None, None, []\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = sum(student_grades.values()) / len(student_grades)\n\n    # Find the highest grade\n    highest_grade = max(student_grades.values())\n\n    # Find the names of students who scored above the average grade\n    above_average_students = [name for name, grade in student_grades.items() if grade > average_grade]\n\n    return average_grade, highest_grade, above_average_students\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    student_grades = {\n        \"John\": 85,\n        \"Alice\": 90,\n        \"Bob\": 78,\n        \"Charlie\": 92,\n        \"David\": 88\n    }\n\n    average_grade, highest_grade, above_average_students = calculate_student_grades(student_grades)\n\n    print(\"Average Grade: {:.2f}\".format(average_grade))\n    print(\"Highest Grade: {:.2f}\".format(highest_grade))\n    print(\"Students with grades above average: {}\".format(above_average_students))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  The `calculate_student_grades` function takes a dictionary of student names and grades as input.\n2.  It calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the total number of students.\n3.  It finds the highest grade by using the `max` function on the dictionary values.\n4.  It identifies the names of students who scored above the average grade using a list comprehension.\n5.  The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculate_student_grades` with an example dictionary of student grades.\n6.  Finally, it prints the average grade, the highest grade, and the names of students who scored above the average grade.",
