  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw or deposit. Use conditional statements to determine if the transaction is possible. If the user wants to withdraw more money than they have, display an error message. If the user wants to deposit a negative amount, display an error message.",

It first asks the user for their current balance and checks if the input is a valid non-negative number.\n\nThe `get_transaction_type` function asks the user if they want to withdraw or deposit money, and the `get_transaction_amount` function gets the amount of the transaction.\n\nThe `process_transaction` function checks if the transaction is possible based on the user's input. If the user wants to withdraw more money than they have, it displays an error message. If the user wants to deposit a negative amount, it also displays an error message.\n\nThe `main` function runs the program in a loop, allowing the user to make multiple transactions until they choose to exit.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Withdrawal: Enter your current balance as 1000, choose to withdraw, and enter the amount as 500. The program will display your new balance as 500.\n*   Deposit: Enter your current balance as 1000, choose to deposit, and enter the amount as 500. The program will display your new balance as 1500.\n*   Insufficient funds: Enter your current balance as 1000, choose to withdraw, and enter the amount as 1500. The program will display an error message saying you do not have sufficient funds.\n*   Negative deposit: Enter your current balance as 1000, choose to deposit, and enter the amount as -500. The program will display an error message saying the deposit amount cannot be negative.",
