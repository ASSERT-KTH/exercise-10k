  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for the temperature outside and prints out a weather forecast based on the following conditions: hot (above 80), warm (65-79), cool (50-64), cold (below 50).",
  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks the user for the temperature outside and prints out a weather forecast based on the given conditions.\n\n```python\ndef get_temperature():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for the temperature outside.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            temperature = float(input(\"Please enter the temperature outside: \"))\n            return temperature\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\ndef get_weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"Determines the weather forecast based on the temperature.\"\"\"\n    if temperature > 80:\n        return \"Hot\"\n    elif 65 <= temperature <= 79:\n        return \"Warm\"\n    elif 50 <= temperature <= 64:\n        return \"Cool\"\n    else:\n        return \"Cold\"\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = get_temperature()\n    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature)\n    print(f\"The weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `get_temperature` function asks the user for the temperature outside and validates the input to ensure it's a number.\n2. The `get_weather_forecast` function determines the weather forecast based on the temperature using the given conditions.\n3. The `main` function calls the above functions and prints out the weather forecast.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* If the user enters a temperature of 85, the program will print \"The weather forecast is: Hot\".\n* If the user enters a temperature of 70, the program will print \"The weather forecast is: Warm\".\n* If the user enters a temperature of 55, the program will print \"The weather forecast is: Cool\".\n* If the user enters a temperature of 40, the program will print \"The weather forecast is: Cold\".",
