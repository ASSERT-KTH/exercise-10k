  "answer": "**Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses recursion to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. This program defines a `Node` class for the binary tree nodes and a `BinaryTree` class with a method to calculate the maximum depth.\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in a binary tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nclass BinaryTree:\n    \"\"\"Represents a binary tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, root=None):\n        self.root = root\n\n    def max_depth(self, node):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the maximum depth of the binary tree.\n\n        Args:\n        node (Node): The current node.\n\n        Returns:\n        int: The maximum depth of the binary tree.\n        \"\"\"\n        if node is None:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            left_depth = self.max_depth(node.left)\n            right_depth = self.max_depth(node.right)\n            return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1\n\n    def find_max_depth(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Finds the maximum depth of the binary tree.\n\n        Returns:\n        int: The maximum depth of the binary tree.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.max_depth(self.root)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create nodes\n    node1 = Node(1)\n    node2 = Node(2)\n    node3 = Node(3)\n    node4 = Node(4)\n    node5 = Node(5)\n    node6 = Node(6)\n    node7 = Node(7)\n\n    # Create binary tree\n    node1.left = node2\n    node1.right = node3\n    node2.left = node4\n    node2.right = node5\n    node3.left = node6\n    node3.right = node7\n\n    # Create binary tree object\n    tree = BinaryTree(node1)\n\n    # Find maximum depth\n    max_depth = tree.find_max_depth()\n\n    print(\"Maximum depth:\", max_depth)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `Node` class represents a single node in the binary tree, with a `value`, `left` child, and `right` child.\n2. The `BinaryTree` class represents the entire binary tree, with a `root` node.\n3. The `max_depth` method is a recursive function that calculates the maximum depth of the binary tree. It takes a `node` as input and returns the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at that node.\n4. If the input `node` is `None`, the method returns 0, since there are no nodes in the subtree.\n5. Otherwise, the method calculates the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees recursively, and returns the maximum of these two depths plus 1 (for the current node).\n6. The `find_max_depth` method calls `max_depth` on the `root` node to find the maximum depth of the entire binary tree.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since we visit each node once.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, since we need to store the recursive call stack. In the worst case, the binary tree is skewed, and h = n.",
