  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an exam score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\nprint(\"Your grade is:\", grade(score))\n```\nThis code defines a function `grade` that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade. It then asks the user to enter a score, calls the `grade` function with the entered score, and prints the result. The `grade` function uses a series of `if` statements to determine the grade based on the score.",
