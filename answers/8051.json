  "answer": "**Bank Account Management Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses an if/else statement to manage a bank account with transactions based on user input.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000 balance\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Deposit:\n\t* User selects option 1 and enters a deposit amount (e.g., $500).\n\t* Program updates the account balance and displays the new balance.\n2. Withdraw:\n\t* User selects option 2 and enters a withdrawal amount (e.g., $200).\n\t* Program checks if the account has sufficient funds. If yes, it updates the account balance and displays the new balance. If not, it displays an \"Insufficient funds\" message.\n3. Check balance:\n\t* User selects option 3.\n\t* Program displays the current account balance.\n4. Exit:\n\t* User selects option 4.\n\t* Program exits and displays a farewell message.\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. The `main` function creates an instance of the `BankAccount` class and presents a menu to the user. Based on the user's input, the program performs the corresponding action using an if/else statement. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.",
