  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a reduction function as input, and returns the reduced value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef reduce(arr, fn):\n    val = arr[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        val = fn(arr[i], val)\n    return val\n```\nThis code defines a `reduce` function that takes an array `arr` and a function `fn` as arguments. It initializes the `val` variable with the first element of the array and then iterates over the rest of the array, applying the function `fn` to each element and the current value of `val`. The result is assigned back to `val`. Finally, the function returns the reduced value.\n\nNote that, as mentioned in the comments, this implementation assumes that the reduction function `fn` takes two arguments and returns a value. If the function takes more or fewer arguments, the code may not work as expected.",
