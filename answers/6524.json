  "answer": "**Arithmetic Operation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function performs arithmetic operations on two numbers based on the provided operator.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The arithmetic operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not supported.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        '/': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operator is supported\n    if operator not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operator. Supported operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    try:\n        result = operations[operator](num1, num2)\n        if result == float('inf'):\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        raise e\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\n    try:\n        print(arithmetic_operation(10, 0, '/'))  # Raises ZeroDivisionError\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n    try:\n        print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '^'))  # Raises ValueError\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator as input.\n*   It uses a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding lambda functions.\n*   The function checks if the operator is supported and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n*   It then performs the operation using the corresponding lambda function and returns the result.\n*   If the operator is '/' and `num2` is 0, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different operators and handles potential errors.",
