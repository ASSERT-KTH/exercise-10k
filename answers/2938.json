  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other using a for loop. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the strings are not the same length, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character\n    char_count = {}\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each character in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Subtract the occurrences of each character in the second string\n    for char in str2:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] -= 1\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    # If any character has a count that is not zero, the strings are not anagrams\n    for count in char_count.values():\n        if count != 0:\n            return False\n\n    # If we have not returned False by now, the strings are anagrams\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether they are anagrams.\n2. The function first removes any whitespace and converts the strings to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It then checks if the strings are the same length. If they are not, it immediately returns False, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4. The function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the first string.\n5. It then subtracts the occurrences of each character in the second string from the dictionary.\n6. If any character has a count that is not zero after subtracting, the strings are not anagrams, and the function returns False.\n7. If the function has not returned False by now, it returns True, indicating that the strings are anagrams.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking if two words are anagrams of each other\n* Validating anagram-based puzzles or games\n* Detecting anagrams in text data for data analysis or machine learning applications",
