  "answer": "**Partitioning a List into Two Separate Lists**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that partitions a given list into two separate lists based on a specific condition.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef partition_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition a list into two separate lists based on a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists: one with elements that satisfy the condition and another with elements that don't.\n    \"\"\"\n    list1 = [element for element in input_list if condition(element)]\n    list2 = [element for element in input_list if not condition(element)]\n    return list1, list2\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    condition = lambda x: x % 2 == 0  # Condition: even numbers\n\n    even_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, condition)\n\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n    print(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `partition_list` function takes two arguments: `input_list` and `condition`.\n2. The `condition` argument is a function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.\n3. The function uses list comprehensions to create two separate lists: one with elements that satisfy the condition and another with elements that don't.\n4. The function returns a tuple containing the two lists.\n5. In the example usage, we define a list of numbers and a condition function that checks if a number is even.\n6. We call the `partition_list` function with the list of numbers and the condition function, and print the resulting lists.\n\n### Example Output\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```",
