  "prompt": "Write a function that generates a new function that adds a given number to its input.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates another function to add a specified number to its input, addressing your request for a step-by-step solution. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining a function that takes a number as an argument.\ndef generate_add_function(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates a new function that adds a given number to its input.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to be added to the input of the generated function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that adds the given number to its input.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Now, we define a nested function inside our main function. This nested function will have access to the variables of the outer function.\n    def add_function(x):\n        # The nested function simply adds the given number to its input and returns the result.\n        return x + num\n\n    # Finally, we return the nested function. This allows us to use the nested function outside the scope of the outer function.\n    return add_function\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# We generate a function that adds 5 to its input.\nadd_five = generate_add_function(5)\n\n# We use the generated function to add 5 to 10.\nprint(add_five(10))  # Outputs: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `generate_add_function` takes a number `num` as an argument and returns a new function `add_function` that adds `num` to its input `x`.\n* The `add_function` is defined inside `generate_add_function`, allowing it to access `num` even after `generate_add_function` has finished executing.\n* This technique is known as a closure, where the inner function has access to the variables of the outer function, making it possible to create functions with custom behavior.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to generate a function that adds 5 to its input using `generate_add_function(5)` and then use it to add 5 to 10, resulting in an output of 15.",
