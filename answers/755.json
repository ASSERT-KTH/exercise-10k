  "answer": "**Word Scrambler Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a word as input, scrambles its letters, and returns the scrambled word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles the letters of a given word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The input word to be scrambled.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the word to a list of characters\n    char_list = list(word)\n    \n    # Shuffle the list of characters\n    random.shuffle(char_list)\n    \n    # Join the shuffled characters back into a string\n    scrambled_word = ''.join(char_list)\n    \n    return scrambled_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input word from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    \n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    \n    # Print the scrambled word\n    print(\"Scrambled word:\", scrambled_word)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a word when prompted (e.g., \"hello\").\n3. The program will print the scrambled word (e.g., \"lloeh\").\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it to a list of characters.\n2. The `random.shuffle` function is used to shuffle the list of characters.\n3. The shuffled characters are then joined back into a string using the `join` method.\n4. The `main` function gets the input word from the user, scrambles it using the `scramble_word` function, and prints the scrambled word.",
