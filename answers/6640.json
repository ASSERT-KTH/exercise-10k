  "answer": "**Refactored Function: Calculating the Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**\n====================================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. We will start with a simple implementation and then refactor it to simplify and improve the code.\n\n### Initial Implementation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return area, perimeter\n\ndef print_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width)\n    print(f\"Area: {area}, Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_rectangle_properties(5, 3)\n```\n\n### Refactored Implementation\n\nWe can simplify and improve the code by creating a `Rectangle` class with methods to calculate the area and perimeter. This approach encapsulates the data and behavior of a rectangle, making the code more object-oriented and easier to maintain.\n\n```python\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a Rectangle object with the given length and width.\n        \n        Args:\n            length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n            width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n\n    def calculate_area(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the area of the rectangle.\n        \n        Returns:\n            float: The area of the rectangle.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.length * self.width\n\n    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the perimeter of the rectangle.\n        \n        Returns:\n            float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n        \"\"\"\n        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)\n\n    def print_properties(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n        \"\"\"\n        area = self.calculate_area()\n        perimeter = self.calculate_perimeter()\n        print(f\"Area: {area}, Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nrectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)\nrectangle.print_properties()\n```\n\n**Benefits of Refactoring:**\n\n1.  **Improved Encapsulation**: The `Rectangle` class encapsulates the data (length and width) and behavior (calculating area and perimeter) of a rectangle, making the code more object-oriented and easier to maintain.\n2.  **Simplified Code**: The refactored code is more concise and easier to understand, with each method having a single responsibility.\n3.  **Reusability**: The `Rectangle` class can be reused in other parts of the program, reducing code duplication and improving modularity.\n4.  **Easier Extension**: The refactored code is more extensible, allowing for easy addition of new methods or properties to the `Rectangle` class.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1.  **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each method should have a single responsibility and not perform multiple unrelated tasks.\n2.  **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability and understandability.\n3.  **Use Comments and Docstrings**: Include comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and behavior of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.\n4.  **Test and Validate**: Test and validate the code to ensure it works correctly and meets the required functionality.",
