  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer score as input and outputs a grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\ndef grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\nscore = int(input(\"Enter a score: \"))\nprint(grade(score))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `grade` that takes a score as input and returns a grade based on the score. It then asks the user to input a score, converts it to an integer, and prints the grade returned by the `grade` function.",
