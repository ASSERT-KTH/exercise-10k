  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be greater than zero.\")\n    return length * width\n\n# Get the length and width from the user\nlength = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\ntry:\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area}.\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Function definition**: We define a function called `calculate_rectangle_area` that takes two parameters: `length` and `width`.\n2. **Input validation**: We check if `length` and `width` are greater than zero. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n3. **Area calculation**: We calculate the area by multiplying `length` and `width`.\n4. **User input**: We ask the user to input the `length` and `width` of the rectangle.\n5. **Error handling**: We use a try-except block to catch any `ValueError` that might be raised.\n6. **Result**: We print the calculated area.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter `5` as the length and `3` as the width. The program should output: `The area of the rectangle is 15.0.`\n* Run the program and enter `0` as the length and `3` as the width. The program should output: `Length and width must be greater than zero.`",
