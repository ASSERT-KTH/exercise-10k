  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates student grades based on their scores in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should define a function to calculate the average score and another function to determine the grade based on the average score. The grade scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to get subject scores\ndef get_subject_score(subject):\n    while True:\n        score = input(f\"Enter your {subject} score: \")\n        if score.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():\n            score = float(score)\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                return score\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n# Define a function to get average score\ndef get_average_score(math, science, english):\n    return (math + science + english) / 3\n\n# Define a function to get grade\ndef get_grade(average_score):\n    if 90 <= average_score <= 100:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif 80 <= average_score < 90:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif 70 <= average_score < 80:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif 60 <= average_score < 70:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Main program\ndef main():\n    math_score = get_subject_score(\"Math\")\n    science_score = get_subject_score(\"Science\")\n    english_score = get_subject_score(\"English\")\n    \n    average_score = get_average_score(math_score, science_score, english_score)\n    \n    grade = get_grade(average_score)\n    \n    print(f\"Your Math score is: {math_score}\")\n    print(f\"Your Science score is: {science_score}\")\n    print(f\"Your English score is: {english_score}\")\n    print(f\"Your average score is: {average_score:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your grade is: {grade}\")\n\n# Call the main program\nmain()\n```\nNote that I used the `input` function to get user input, and the `float` function to convert the input to a floating-point number. I also used the `replace` method to remove the decimal point from the input string, and the `isdigit` method to check if the resulting string is a digit. Additionally, I used the `:.2f` format specifier to print the average score with two decimal places.",
