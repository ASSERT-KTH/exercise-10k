  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Get two numbers from the user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the GCD\nprint(\"The GCD of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", gcd(num1, num2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `gcd` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n*   The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0. At this point, `a` is the GCD.\n*   The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n*   The program then prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates their GCD using the `gcd` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   If the user enters 48 and 18, the program will output 6, because 6 is the largest number that divides both 48 and 18 without leaving a remainder.\n*   If the user enters 54 and 24, the program will output 6, because 6 is the largest number that divides both 54 and 24 without leaving a remainder.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  Define a function `gcd` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n2.  Use a while loop to repeatedly replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0.\n3.  Return the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n4.  Prompt the user to enter two numbers.\n5.  Calculate the GCD of the two numbers using the `gcd` function.\n6.  Print the result.",
