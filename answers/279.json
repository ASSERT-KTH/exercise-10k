  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount and total cost of a product given its price and tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax amount and total cost of a product.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The price of the product.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g. 8% = 0.08).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the tax amount and total cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    total_cost = price + tax_amount\n    return tax_amount, total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    price = 100.0  # Price of the product\n    tax_rate = 0.08  # Tax rate (8%)\n\n    tax_amount, total_cost = calculate_tax(price, tax_rate)\n\n    print(f\"Price: ${price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax Rate: {tax_rate*100:.0f}%\")\n    print(f\"Tax Amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes in the price and tax rate as arguments and returns a tuple containing the tax amount and total cost.\n2. The tax amount is calculated by multiplying the price by the tax rate.\n3. The total cost is calculated by adding the tax amount to the price.\n4. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_tax` function with a price of $100.00 and a tax rate of 8%.\n5. The program prints out the price, tax rate, tax amount, and total cost.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nPrice: $100.00\nTax Rate: 8%\nTax Amount: $8.00\nTotal Cost: $108.00\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file named `tax_calculator.py` and execute it using Python (e.g. `python tax_calculator.py`).",
