  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a word scramble game by taking a list of words, scrambling each word, and asking the user to unscramble it. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of 'correct' or 'incorrect'.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles a given word by shuffling its characters.\n    \n    Args:\n    word (str): The word to scramble.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef word_scramble_game(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a word scramble game by scrambling each word and asking the user to unscramble it.\n    \n    Args:\n    words (list): A list of words to scramble.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    total_words = len(words)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n        print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n        guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n        \n        if guess.lower() == word.lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {word}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Game over! Your final score is {score}/{total_words}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n    word_scramble_game(words)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and scrambles it by shuffling its characters using the `random.shuffle` function.\n2. The `word_scramble_game` function generates the word scramble game by iterating over a list of words, scrambling each word, and asking the user to unscramble it.\n3. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of 'correct' or 'incorrect' and keeps track of the user's score.\n4. The `main` function initializes the list of words and starts the game.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `main` function. The program will prompt the user to unscramble each word, and after each guess, it will provide feedback and update the score. The game continues until all words have been scrambled and guessed.\n\n**Note:** The program uses a simple list of words for demonstration purposes. You can modify the `words` list in the `main` function to include your own list of words.",
