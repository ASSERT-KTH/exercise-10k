  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a year as input and returns whether it is a leap year or not using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses conditional statements to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `is_leap_year(year)` that checks if a year is a leap year using the following rules:\n- The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n- If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible by 400.\n\nThe `main()` function gets a year from the user, checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year(year)` function, and prints the result.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it, enter a year when prompted, and it will tell you whether the year is a leap year or not.",
