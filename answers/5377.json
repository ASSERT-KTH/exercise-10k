  "answer": "**Symmetric Difference Program**\n================================\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. Here's a Python program that calculates the symmetric difference of two or more arrays.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(*arrays):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference of two or more arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        *arrays: Variable number of arrays.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set containing the symmetric difference of the input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = set(arrays[0])\n    for array in arrays[1:]:\n        result = result.symmetric_difference(set(array))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    array2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    array3 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    print(\"Symmetric difference of array1 and array2:\")\n    print(symmetric_difference(array1, array2))\n\n    print(\"\\nSymmetric difference of array1, array2, and array3:\")\n    print(symmetric_difference(array1, array2, array3))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `symmetric_difference` function takes a variable number of arrays as input using the `*arrays` syntax.\n*   It initializes the `result` set with the first array.\n*   Then, it iterates over the remaining arrays, updating the `result` set with the symmetric difference of the current `result` and the current array.\n*   Finally, it returns the `result` set, which contains the symmetric difference of all input arrays.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the program, it calculates and prints the symmetric difference of `array1` and `array2`, as well as the symmetric difference of `array1`, `array2`, and `array3`.\n\n```\nSymmetric difference of array1 and array2:\n{1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSymmetric difference of array1, array2, and array3:\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}\n```",
