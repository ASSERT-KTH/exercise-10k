  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that performs basic set operations.\n\n```python\nclass SetOperations:\n    def __init__(self, set1, set2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the SetOperations class with two sets.\n\n        Args:\n            set1 (set): The first set.\n            set2 (set): The second set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.set1 = set1\n        self.set2 = set2\n\n    def union(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the union of the two sets.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The union of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.union(self.set2)\n\n    def intersection(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the intersection of the two sets.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The intersection of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.intersection(self.set2)\n\n    def difference(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the difference of the two sets (set1 - set2).\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The difference of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.difference(self.set2)\n\n    def symmetric_difference(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The symmetric difference of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.symmetric_difference(self.set2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define two sets\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    # Create a SetOperations object\n    set_operations = SetOperations(set1, set2)\n\n    # Perform set operations\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Union:\", set_operations.union())\n    print(\"Intersection:\", set_operations.intersection())\n    print(\"Difference (set1 - set2):\", set_operations.difference())\n    print(\"Symmetric Difference:\", set_operations.symmetric_difference())\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   The `union` method returns a set containing all elements from both `set1` and `set2`.\n*   The `intersection` method returns a set containing elements common to both `set1` and `set2`.\n*   The `difference` method returns a set containing elements in `set1` but not in `set2`.\n*   The `symmetric_difference` method returns a set containing elements in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a `SetOperations` class to encapsulate the set operations.\n*   The `__init__` method initializes the class with two sets.\n*   The `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, and `symmetric_difference` methods perform the respective set operations using the built-in set methods in Python.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `SetOperations` class by creating two sets, performing set operations, and printing the results.",
