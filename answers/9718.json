  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two fractions as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that adds two fractions:\n\n```python\ndef add_fractions(frac1, frac2):\n    # Split the fractions into numerators and denominators\n    num1, denom1 = map(int, frac1.split('/'))\n    num2, denom2 = map(int, frac2.split('/'))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the fractions\n    lcm = (denom1 * denom2) // gcd(denom1, denom2)\n    sum_num = (lcm // denom1) * num1 + (lcm // denom2) * num2\n\n    # Simplify the sum\n    g = gcd(sum_num, lcm)\n    simplified_num = sum_num // g\n    simplified_denom = lcm // g\n\n    return f\"{simplified_num}/{simplified_denom}\"\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Test the function\nfrac1 = input(\"Enter the first fraction (e.g., 1/2): \")\nfrac2 = input(\"Enter the second fraction (e.g., 1/3): \")\n\nresult = add_fractions(frac1, frac2)\nprint(f\"The sum of {frac1} and {frac2} is {result}.\")\n```\n\nThis program uses the following steps to add two fractions:\n\n1.  **Split the fractions**: It splits each fraction into its numerator and denominator using the `/` character as a separator.\n2.  **Calculate the sum**: It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators and then uses it to find the sum of the fractions.\n3.  **Simplify the sum**: It simplifies the sum by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n4.  **Return the result**: It returns the simplified sum as a string in the format \"numerator/denominator\".\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter two fractions. After you enter the fractions, it will display their sum.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nEnter the first fraction (e.g., 1/2): 1/2\nEnter the second fraction (e.g., 1/3): 1/3\nThe sum of 1/2 and 1/3 is 5/6.\n```",
