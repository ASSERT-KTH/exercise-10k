  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n=====================================================\n\nHere's a Python program that uses a set to keep track of unique characters and a list to preserve the original order of characters.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Remove duplicate characters from a string, preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Input String:\", input_string)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_string))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Create an empty set `seen` to store unique characters.\n2. Create an empty list `result` to store characters without duplicates.\n3. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. Check if the character is not in the `seen` set.\n5. If it's not in the `seen` set, add it to the `seen` set and append it to the `result` list.\n6. Finally, join the characters in the `result` list into a string using `''.join(result)`.\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it uses a set to check for duplicate characters, which has an average time complexity of O(1). The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to store the characters in the `seen` set and the `result` list.",
