  "answer": "**Game of Life Simulator**\n================================\n\nThe Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. This program implements the Game of Life using Python and the Pygame library for visualization.\n\n**Rules of the Game**\n--------------------\n\n1.  **Survival**: Every cell that has two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.\n2.  **Death by isolation**: Each cell with one or zero live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n3.  **Death by overcrowding**: Each cell with four or more live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4.  **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n**Implementation**\n-----------------\n\n### Dependencies\n\n*   Python 3.8+\n*   Pygame 2.0+\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Window size\nWIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 800\n\n# Cell size\nCELL_SIZE = 10\n\n# Colors\nALIVE_COLOR = (255, 255, 255)\nDEAD_COLOR = (0, 0, 0)\n\nclass GameOfLife:\n    def __init__(self, width, height, cell_size):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n        self.cell_size = cell_size\n        self.grid = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(height // cell_size, width // cell_size), p=[0.5, 0.5])\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        screen.fill(DEAD_COLOR)\n        for i in range(self.grid.shape[0]):\n            for j in range(self.grid.shape[1]):\n                if self.grid[i, j] == 1:\n                    pygame.draw.rect(screen, ALIVE_COLOR, (j * self.cell_size, i * self.cell_size, self.cell_size, self.cell_size))\n\n    def update(self):\n        new_grid = np.copy(self.grid)\n        for i in range(self.grid.shape[0]):\n            for j in range(self.grid.shape[1]):\n                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(i, j)\n                if self.grid[i, j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):\n                    new_grid[i, j] = 0\n                elif self.grid[i, j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[i, j] = 1\n        self.grid = new_grid\n\n    def count_live_neighbors(self, i, j):\n        count = 0\n        for x in range(-1, 2):\n            for y in range(-1, 2):\n                col = (j + y + self.grid.shape[1]) % self.grid.shape[1]\n                row = (i + x + self.grid.shape[0]) % self.grid.shape[0]\n                count += self.grid[row, col]\n        count -= self.grid[i, j]\n        return count\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))\n    clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n    game = GameOfLife(WIDTH, HEIGHT, CELL_SIZE)\n\n    running = True\n    while running:\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                running = False\n\n        game.draw(screen)\n        pygame.display.flip()\n        game.update()\n        clock.tick(60)\n\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `GameOfLife` class initializes a grid of random cells and provides methods to draw and update the grid.\n2.  The `draw` method fills the screen with dead cells and draws alive cells as white rectangles.\n3.  The `update` method applies the rules of the Game of Life to each cell, updating the grid for the next generation.\n4.  The `count_live_neighbors` method counts the number of alive neighbors for a given cell, handling edge cases using modular arithmetic.\n5.  The `main` function initializes Pygame, creates a `GameOfLife` instance, and runs the simulation in a loop, handling events and updating the display at 60 frames per second.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1.  Install the required dependencies using `pip install pygame numpy`.\n2.  Run the program using `python game_of_life.py`.\n3.  The simulation will display a window with a grid of cells, updating in real-time according to the rules of the Game of Life.\n4.  Close the window to exit the program.",
