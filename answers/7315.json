  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is within a valid range.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if the number entered by the user is within a valid range:\n\n```python\ndef check_number_in_range():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the number entered by the user is within a valid range.\n    \n    The valid range is assumed to be between 1 and 100.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get the number from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    \n    # Define the valid range\n    min_valid = 1\n    max_valid = 100\n    \n    # Check if the number is within the valid range\n    if min_valid <= num <= max_valid:\n        print(f\"The number {num} is within the valid range of {min_valid} to {max_valid}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The number {num} is not within the valid range of {min_valid} to {max_valid}.\")\n\n# Call the function\ncheck_number_in_range()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `check_number_in_range` function is defined to encapsulate the program's logic.\n2. **User Input**: The program uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input until a valid number is entered. It uses a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the input cannot be converted to a float.\n3. **Valid Range Definition**: The valid range is defined by the `min_valid` and `max_valid` variables, which are set to 1 and 100, respectively.\n4. **Range Check**: The program checks if the user's number is within the valid range using a conditional statement. If the number is within the range, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints a failure message.\n5. **Function Call**: The `check_number_in_range` function is called to start the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Enter a number within the valid range (e.g., 50) to see a success message.\n* Enter a number outside the valid range (e.g., 200) to see a failure message.\n* Enter a non-numeric input (e.g., \"abc\") to see an error message and be prompted to try again.",
