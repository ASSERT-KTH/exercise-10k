  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a credit card number as input and checks if it is valid based on the Luhn algorithm using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that checks if a credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm with if/else statements:\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card(card_number):\n    # Convert card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(x) for x in str(card_number)]\n    \n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n    \n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n    \n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    if sum(card_number) % 10 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    card_number = input(\"Enter a credit card number: \")\n    \n    # Check if the input is a number\n    if not card_number.isdigit():\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    else:\n        # Check if the card number is valid\n        if validate_credit_card(card_number):\n            print(\"The credit card number is valid.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The credit card number is not valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It takes a credit card number as input from the user.\n2. It checks if the input is a number. If not, it prints an error message.\n3. It converts the card number to a list of integers and reverses it.\n4. It doubles every second digit in the reversed list. If the result is greater than 9, it subtracts 9 from it.\n5. It checks if the sum of the digits in the list is divisible by 10. If it is, the card number is valid; otherwise, it's not.\n6. Finally, it prints whether the card number is valid or not.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input credit card number is a valid number (i.e., it doesn't contain any non-numeric characters except for the possible hyphens or spaces). If you want to handle more complex inputs, you might need to add additional error checking code.",
