  "prompt": "Create a function that takes in a list of authors and their corresponding book titles. The function should then return a dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles. If an author has no books, they should not be included in the dictionary.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a function that maps authors to their book titles, ensuring that only authors with books are included in the resulting dictionary. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef create_author_book_dict(authors_and_books):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an author's name and a list of their book titles.\n    It returns a dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles.\n    If an author has no books, they are not included in the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        authors_and_books (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains an author's name and a list of their book titles.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the authors' names and the values are lists of their book titles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the authors and their books\n    author_book_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each author and their books in the input list\n    for author, books in authors_and_books:\n        \n        # Check if the author has any books\n        if books:\n            \n            # If the author has books, add them to the dictionary\n            # This will overwrite any existing entry for the author, but since we're not modifying existing books, this is fine\n            author_book_dict[author] = books\n\n    # Return the dictionary of authors and their books\n    return author_book_dict\n\n\n# Example usage:\nauthors_and_books = [\n    (\"Author1\", [\"Book1\", \"Book2\"]),\n    (\"Author2\", []),\n    (\"Author3\", [\"Book3\", \"Book4\"]),\n]\n\nprint(create_author_book_dict(authors_and_books))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `create_author_book_dict` takes a list of tuples `authors_and_books` as input, where each tuple contains an author's name and a list of their book titles.\n* It iterates over each tuple in the input list, checking if the author has any books. If they do, the author and their books are added to the `author_book_dict` dictionary.\n* The function returns the `author_book_dict` dictionary, which contains only the authors with books.\n* In the example usage, the function is called with a list of authors and their books, and the resulting dictionary is printed, demonstrating the expected output.",
