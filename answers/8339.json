  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should then calculate the average grade of all students and return a dictionary with the student names as keys and their respective grades along with a message indicating whether they are above or below the average grade.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade of all students and returns a dictionary with student names as keys, their respective grades, and a message indicating whether they are above or below the average grade. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade of all students and returns a dictionary \n    with the student names as keys, their respective grades, and a message indicating \n    whether they are above or below the average grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are student names, values are dictionaries containing \n        the student's grade and a message indicating whether they are above or below the average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to calculate the sum of all grades to find the average later\n    total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n\n    # Then, we calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of students\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results\n    result = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades.items():\n        # For each student, check if their grade is above or below the average\n        if grade > average_grade:\n            # If the grade is above the average, append a message indicating this\n            message = \"above the average\"\n        elif grade < average_grade:\n            # If the grade is below the average, append a message indicating this\n            message = \"below the average\"\n        else:\n            # If the grade is equal to the average, append a message indicating this\n            message = \"equal to the average\"\n\n        # Store the student's grade and message in the result dictionary\n        result[student] = {\"grade\": grade, \"message\": message}\n\n    # Finally, return the result dictionary\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"Alice\": 90,\n    \"Bob\": 80,\n    \"Charlie\": 95,\n    \"David\": 85\n}\n\nprint(calculate_average_grade(grades))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_average_grade` takes a dictionary `grades` as input, where keys are student names and values are their grades. It calculates the sum of all grades using `sum(grades.values())` and then finds the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of students.\n*   It then iterates over each student in the `grades` dictionary, checking if their grade is above or below the average grade. Based on this comparison, it appends a corresponding message to the student's grade.\n*   The results are stored in a dictionary `result`, where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing the student's grade and the message.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary, providing the desired output.",
