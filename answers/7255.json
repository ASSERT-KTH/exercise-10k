  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers based on the input size. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to the input size, and each number is separated by a space. Use loops (for/while) to achieve this.",
  "answer": "Based on the specification you provided, here is the code that meets the requirements:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            cout << j + 1 << \" \";\n        }\n        cout << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer `n` from the standard input, and then uses two nested loops to print a square pattern of numbers. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, the inner loop prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces. After each row, a newline character is printed using `cout << endl`.\n\nFor example, if the input is `5`, the output will be:\n```\n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n```",
