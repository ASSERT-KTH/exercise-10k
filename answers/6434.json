  "answer": "Here's a Python program to calculate the future value of an investment using compound interest.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the future value of an investment using compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The future value of the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the future value to the principal\n    future_value = principal\n\n    # Iterate over each year\n    for year in range(1, years + 1):\n        # Calculate the interest for this year\n        interest = future_value * annual_interest_rate\n\n        # Add the interest to the future value\n        future_value += interest\n\n        # Print the future value for this year\n        print(f'Year {year}: The future value is ${future_value:.2f}')\n\n    return future_value\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal, annual interest rate, and years from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the initial investment amount: $\"))\n    annual_interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the future value\n    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)\n\n    print(f'\\nThe future value of your investment after {years} years is ${future_value:.2f}')\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to input the initial investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years. For example, if you input `$1000`, `5` (for 5%), and `10`, it will calculate and print the future value of your investment for each year, and then print the total future value after 10 years. \n\n### How It Works\n1. The `calculate_future_value` function takes in the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years as parameters.\n2. It initializes the future value to the principal amount.\n3. It then iterates over each year using a for loop.\n4. For each year, it calculates the interest by multiplying the current future value by the annual interest rate.\n5. It adds the interest to the future value.\n6. It prints the future value for each year.\n7. Finally, it returns the total future value after the specified number of years.\n\n### Advice\n- Make sure to enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%).\n- The program assumes that the interest rate remains constant over the years.\n- You can modify the program to handle different types of investments or interest rates.",
