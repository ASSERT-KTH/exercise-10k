  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nBelow is an example in Python that demonstrates how to declare a variable, assign it a value, and then print out the value.\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable and assign it a value\nvariable_name = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Print out the value of the variable\nprint(variable_name)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `Hello, World!`\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: The code starts by declaring a variable named `variable_name`. This is done using the syntax `variable_name = value`, where `variable_name` is the name of the variable and `value` is the initial value assigned to it.\n2. **Assignment**: In this case, the variable is assigned the string value `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n3. **Printing**: The `print()` function is then used to output the value of `variable_name` to the console.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nTo run this code, you can save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `example.py`) and then execute it using Python (for example, `python example.py` in your terminal or command prompt).",
