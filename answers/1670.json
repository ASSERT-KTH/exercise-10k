  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the amount of money as input and calculates the number of coins of each denomination (1, 5, 10, 25) needed to make the change using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed to make the change.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (int): The amount of money to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the denominations\n    denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]\n\n    # Initialize the count of coins for each denomination\n    coin_count = {denomination: 0 for denomination in denominations}\n\n    # Calculate the number of coins of each denomination\n    for denomination in denominations:\n        coin_count[denomination] = amount // denomination\n        amount %= denomination\n\n    # Print the result\n    for denomination, count in coin_count.items():\n        print(f\"{denomination} cents: {count} coin(s)\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the amount from the user\n    amount = int(input(\"Enter the amount of money (in cents): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the change\n    calculate_change(amount)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\nThis program first defines the denominations of the coins, then initializes a dictionary to store the count of coins for each denomination. It then calculates the number of coins of each denomination by using integer division (`//`) to get the quotient and the modulus operator (`%`) to get the remainder. Finally, it prints the result.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEnter the amount of money (in cents): 37\n25 cents: 1 coin(s)\n10 cents: 1 coin(s)\n5 cents: 0 coin(s)\n1 cents: 2 coin(s)\n```\n\nIn this example, the program calculates that 37 cents can be made with 1 quarter (25 cents), 1 dime (10 cents), and 2 pennies (2 cents).",
