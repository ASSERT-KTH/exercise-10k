  "answer": "**User Information Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a name and age as input from the user and prints out a formatted string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user name and age from input\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_user_info(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a formatted string with user information\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_user_info(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to enter their name and age.\n2. The `print_user_info` function takes the user's name and age as input and prints out a formatted string.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_user_info` to print the formatted string.\n4. The program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input for the age.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g. `user_info.py`) and run it using Python (e.g. `python user_info.py`). Follow the prompts to enter your name and age, and the program will print out a formatted string with your information.",
