  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes the student's scores as input and calculates their grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the given score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade (A, B, C, D, F).\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes the student's score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given criteria.\n2. The `main` function gets the student's score as input from the user, validates it to ensure it's an integer between 0 and 100, and then calls the `calculate_grade` function to calculate the grade.\n3. The calculated grade is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* If the user enters a score of 95, the program will output: \"The student's grade is: A\"\n* If the user enters a score of 75, the program will output: \"The student's grade is: C\"\n* If the user enters a score of 40, the program will output: \"The student's grade is: F\"",
