  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the original price and the discount percentage as input and returns the price after the discount.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the price after a discount:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the price after a discount.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The percentage of the discount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The price after the discount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price\n    \n    # Calculate the price after the discount\n    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount\n    \n    return discounted_price\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the price after the discount\n    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)\n    print(f\"The price after the discount is: ${discounted_price:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Get User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage.\n2. **Calculate Discount Amount**: The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage divided by 100.\n3. **Calculate Discounted Price**: The discounted price is calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.\n4. **Print Discounted Price**: The discounted price is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIf you enter an original price of `100` and a discount percentage of `20`, the program will output:\n\n```\nThe price after the discount is: $80.00\n```",
