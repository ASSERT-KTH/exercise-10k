  "answer": "**Word Counter Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program will ask the user for a string input and then print out the number of words in that string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of words in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count words from.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = input_string.split()\n    return len(words)\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for a string\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Count the words in the string\n    word_count = count_words(user_string)\n\n    # Print the word count\n    print(f\"The string contains {word_count} words.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_words` function takes a string as input, splits it into words using the `split` method (which splits on whitespace by default), and returns the number of words.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for a string using the `input` function, counts the words using the `count_words` function, and prints the result.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\n$ python word_counter.py\nPlease enter a string: Hello world this is a test\nThe string contains 6 words.\n```",
