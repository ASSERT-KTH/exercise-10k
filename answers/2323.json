  "answer": "**String Input and Output Program**\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that takes a string input from the user and prints it to the screen.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user for a string input\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Print the user's input to the screen\n    print(\"You entered: \", user_input)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get a string input from the user.\n2. The `print()` function is used to display the user's input on the screen.\n3. The `main()` function contains the program logic and is called when the script is run.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a string (e.g., \"Hello, World!\").\n3. The program will print the string you entered to the screen.",
