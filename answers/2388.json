  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a while loop. This program assumes that we have coins of denominations 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, and 1 cent.\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(amount):\n    coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n\n    while amount > 0 and i < len(coins):\n        if amount >= coins[i]:\n            amount -= coins[i]\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return count\n\n# Test the function\namount = int(input(\"Enter the amount in cents: \"))\nprint(\"Minimum number of coins needed:\", min_coins(amount))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It first defines a function `min_coins` that takes the amount as input.\n2. It then defines the available coin denominations in a list `coins`.\n3. It initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of coins used and a variable `i` to keep track of the current coin denomination.\n4. It then enters a while loop that continues until the amount is 0 or it has tried all coin denominations.\n5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current coin denomination can be used to make part of the change. If it can, it subtracts the coin denomination from the amount and increments the count.\n6. If the current coin denomination cannot be used, it moves on to the next denomination.\n7. Once the loop ends, it returns the total count of coins used.\n8. Finally, it tests the function with a user-provided amount and prints the result.",
