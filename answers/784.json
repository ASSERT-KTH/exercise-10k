  "answer": "**Tip and Total Cost Calculator Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tip and total cost of a meal given the cost of the meal and the tip percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip amount based on the meal cost and tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * meal_cost\n    return tip_amount\n\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of the meal including the tip.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_amount (float): The tip amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Tip and Total Cost Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get the meal cost from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n            if meal_cost < 0:\n                print(\"Meal cost cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n            if tip_percentage < 0:\n                print(\"Tip percentage cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_amount)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Meal cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip percentage: {tip_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Tip amount: ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal when prompted (e.g., `25.99`).\n3. Enter the tip percentage when prompted (e.g., `15`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the tip amount and total cost.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses two functions: `calculate_tip` to calculate the tip amount and `calculate_total_cost` to calculate the total cost.\n* The `main` function gets the meal cost and tip percentage from the user, calculates the tip amount and total cost, and prints the results.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters valid input (non-negative numbers) for the meal cost and tip percentage.",
