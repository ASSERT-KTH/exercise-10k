When you run the program, you'll be asked how many questions you want to ask.\n2. For each question, you'll be prompted to enter the question itself, the number of possible answers, each possible answer, and the correct answer.\n3. After you've entered all the questions, the program will ask you each question in turn and keep track of your score.\n4. After all the questions have been asked, the program will print out your final score.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nLet's say you want to ask 2 questions. You would enter `2` when prompted for the number of questions. Then, for each question, you would enter the question, the number of possible answers, each possible answer, and the correct answer.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nHow many questions do you want to ask? 2\nEnter question 1: What is the capital of France?\nHow many possible answers does this question have? 3\nEnter possible answer 1: Berlin\nEnter possible answer 2: Paris\nEnter possible answer 3: London\nEnter the correct answer: Paris\nEnter question 2: What is the largest planet in our solar system?\nHow many possible answers does this question have? 3\nEnter possible answer 1: Earth\nEnter possible answer 2: Saturn\nEnter possible answer 3: Jupiter\nEnter the correct answer: Jupiter\n```\n\nThen, the program would ask you each question in turn, and you would enter the number of your answer. After all the questions have been asked, the program would print out your final score.",
