  "answer": "**Rectangle Area Calculation Function**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_rectangle_area` function takes two arguments: `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be positive floating-point numbers.\n*   It checks if either the `length` or `width` is less than or equal to zero and raises a `ValueError` if so, as the area of a rectangle with non-positive dimensions is undefined.\n*   The function calculates the area by multiplying the `length` and `width` and returns the result.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use this function to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5.0 units and a width of 3.0 units.",
