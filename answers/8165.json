  "answer": "**Counting Occurrences of an Element in an Array**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nCreate an array of 5 integers and count the occurrences of a specific element.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a list to represent the array and the `count()` method to find the occurrences of the specific element.\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of a specific element in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        target (int): The target element to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.\n    \"\"\"\n    return array.count(target)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create an array of 5 integers\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n\n    # Specify the target element\n    target = 2\n\n    # Count the occurrences of the target element\n    occurrences = count_occurrences(array, target)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The element {target} occurs {occurrences} times in the array.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `count_occurrences()` that takes an array and a target element as input.\n2. Use the `count()` method of the list to find the number of occurrences of the target element.\n3. Return the count.\n4. In the example usage, create an array of 5 integers and specify the target element.\n5. Call the `count_occurrences()` function with the array and target element.\n6. Print the result.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe element 2 occurs 2 times in the array.\n```",
