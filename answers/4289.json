  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function to sort a dictionary's key-value pairs by key in ascending order. This will involve a step-by-step breakdown of the solution. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_key(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sorts a dictionary's key-value pairs by key in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the key-value pairs sorted by key in ascending order.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    # We use the built-in sorted function to sort the dictionary items based on the keys\n    # The sorted function returns a new list containing all items from the dictionary in ascending order of their keys\n    sorted_items = sorted(dictionary.items())\n\n    # We then use the dict function to convert the sorted list back into a dictionary\n    # This is because dictionaries in Python 3.7 and later maintain the insertion order, so the resulting dictionary will have the key-value pairs sorted by key\n    sorted_dict = dict(sorted_items)\n\n    # Finally, we return the sorted dictionary\n    return sorted_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}\nsorted_my_dict = sort_dict_by_key(my_dict)\nprint(sorted_my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sort_dict_by_key` first checks if the input is a dictionary using `isinstance(dictionary, dict)`, raising a `TypeError` if it's not.\n* It then uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the dictionary items based on the keys, which returns a new list containing all items from the dictionary in ascending order of their keys.\n* The sorted list is then converted back into a dictionary using the `dict` function, which maintains the insertion order in Python 3.7 and later, resulting in a dictionary with the key-value pairs sorted by key.\n* Finally, the function returns the sorted dictionary.",
