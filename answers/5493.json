  "answer": "**Missing Number in Consecutive Sequence**\n======================================\n\nThis program finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\n    Args:\n    sequence (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The missing number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete\n    complete_sum = sum(range(min(sequence), max(sequence) + 1))\n\n    # Calculate the actual sum of the sequence\n    actual_sum = sum(sequence)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the complete sum and the actual sum\n    missing_number = complete_sum - actual_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage\nsequence = [1, 2, 3, 5]\nmissing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)\nprint(\"The missing number is:\", missing_number)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThis program uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete. It then subtracts the actual sum of the sequence from the complete sum to find the missing number.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n-------------------------\n\n1. **Define the function**: Define a function `find_missing_number` that takes a list of integers `sequence` as input.\n2. **Calculate the complete sum**: Calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n3. **Calculate the actual sum**: Calculate the actual sum of the sequence using the `sum` function.\n4. **Find the missing number**: Subtract the actual sum from the complete sum to find the missing number.\n5. **Return the result**: Return the missing number.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Find the missing number in the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 5]`.\n* Find the missing number in the sequence `[10, 11, 12, 14, 15]`.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input sequence is a list of integers and that the missing number is a single integer. If the input sequence is not a list of integers or if there are multiple missing numbers, the program may not work correctly.",
