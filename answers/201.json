  "prompt": "Create a function that takes no arguments and prints 'Hello World' to the console.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a simple function that prints a greeting message to the console. This function will take no arguments and provide a straightforward output. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function named 'hello_world' that takes no arguments\ndef hello_world():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints 'Hello World' to the console.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    None\n    \n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Inside the function, use the print function to output 'Hello World' to the console\n    print('Hello World')\n\n# Call the function to execute it\nhello_world()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `hello_world` is defined with no parameters, as per the requirements. This means it can be called without passing any arguments.\n* Inside the `hello_world` function, the `print` function is used to output the string 'Hello World' to the console. This is the primary action of the function.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values. Although the function is simple, this documentation is good practice for clarity and usability.\n* Finally, the `hello_world` function is called to execute it and print 'Hello World' to the console.",
