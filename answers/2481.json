  "answer": "**Sorting a List of Numbers in Ascending Order**\n\nBelow is a Python program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function.\n\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of numbers in ascending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted List:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal List: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted List: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `sort_numbers()` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list in ascending order.\n3. The sorted list is then returned.\n4. In the example usage, a list of numbers is created and passed to the `sort_numbers()` function.\n5. The original and sorted lists are then printed to the console.\n\n**Alternative Implementation (without using `sorted()`):**\n\nIf you want to implement the sorting algorithm manually, you can use a simple sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort. Here's an example using Bubble Sort:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using Bubble Sort.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of numbers in ascending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n    return numbers\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted List:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Note:** This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is less efficient than the built-in `sorted()` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, it can be useful for educational purposes or for small lists of numbers.",
