  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. It uses the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest\n- P = principal amount (initial investment)\n- r = annual interest rate (in decimal)\n- n = number of times that interest is compounded per year\n- t = time the money is invested for in years\n\n### Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): Initial investment amount\n    - rate (float): Annual interest rate (in decimal)\n    - time (float): Time period in years\n    - compounding_frequency (int): Number of times interest is compounded per year (default=1)\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: Compound interest amount\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounding_frequency)**(compounding_frequency*time)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in percent): \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n    compounding_frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency per year (default=1): \") or 1)\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency)\n    interest = amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"Compound Interest: {interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: {amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to input the principal amount, annual interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency. The program will then calculate and display the compound interest and total amount.\n\nExample:\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the annual interest rate (in percent): 5\nEnter the time period in years: 2\nEnter the compounding frequency per year (default=1): 1\nCompound Interest: 102.5\nTotal Amount: 1102.50\n```",
