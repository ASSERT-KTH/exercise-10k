  "answer": "**Reading an Excel File with Python**\n\nTo read an Excel file, we will use the `pandas` library, which provides a convenient way to work with Excel files.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.x\n* `pandas` library (install with `pip install pandas`)\n* `openpyxl` library (install with `pip install openpyxl`)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Read an Excel file and print its contents.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): Path to the Excel file\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the Excel file\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n\n        # Print the file's contents\n        print(df)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"File not found. Please check the file path.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = \"example.xlsx\"  # Replace with your file path\n    read_excel_file(file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Import the `pandas` library.\n2. Define a function `read_excel_file` that takes the file path as an argument.\n3. Use `pd.read_excel` to read the Excel file into a DataFrame.\n4. Print the DataFrame using `print(df)`.\n5. Handle exceptions, such as file not found or other errors.\n6. In the example usage, replace `example.xlsx` with the path to your Excel file.\n\n### Notes\n\n* Make sure to install the required libraries using `pip`.\n* This code assumes that the Excel file is in the same directory as the Python script. If it's in a different directory, provide the full path to the file.\n* This code reads the entire Excel file into memory. If you're working with large files, you may need to use a more efficient approach, such as reading the file in chunks.",
