It performs the following bitwise operations:\n\n*   **Bitwise AND** (`&`): Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n*   **Bitwise OR** (`|`): Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n*   **Bitwise XOR** (`^`): Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. If they are the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n*   **Bitwise NOT** (`~`): Flips the bits of the operand. If a bit is 1, it becomes 0, and if a bit is 0, it becomes 1.\n*   **Left shift** (`<<`): Shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The left shift operator essentially multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.\n*   **Right shift** (`>>`): Shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The right shift operator essentially divides the number by 2 for each shift.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `bitwise_operations` function with two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, and prints the results of the bitwise operations.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the results of the bitwise operations on `num1` and `num2`. The output will help you understand how the bitwise operations work.",
