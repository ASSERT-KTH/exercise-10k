  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    # Base case: If the array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Split the array into two halves\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort the halves\n    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)\n\n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in either half, append them to the merged list\n    for i in range(left_index, len(left)):\n        merged.append(left[i])\n    for i in range(right_index, len(right)):\n        merged.append(right[i])\n\n    return merged\n\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = merge_sort(numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted numbers:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n\n*   The `merge_sort` function recursively splits the input list into two halves until each sublist contains only one element (the base case).\n*   The `merge` function merges two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.\n*   A `for` loop is used in the `merge` function to append any remaining elements from the sublists to the merged list.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `merge_sort` function to sort a list of numbers.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n\n```\nSorted numbers: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```",
