  "answer": "### Dictionary Superset Check\n\nBelow is an example implementation in Python that creates two dictionaries with country names as keys and their capitals as values. It then checks if one dictionary is a superset of the other.\n\n```python\ndef is_superset(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if dict1 is a superset of dict2.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The potential superset dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The dictionary to check against.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if dict1 is a superset of dict2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return all(key in dict1 and dict1[key] == value for key, value in dict2.items())\n\ndef main():\n    # Create dictionaries\n    countries1 = {\n        \"France\": \"Paris\",\n        \"Germany\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"Italy\": \"Rome\",\n        \"Spain\": \"Madrid\"\n    }\n    \n    countries2 = {\n        \"France\": \"Paris\",\n        \"Germany\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"Italy\": \"Rome\"\n    }\n    \n    # Check if countries1 is a superset of countries2\n    if is_superset(countries1, countries2):\n        print(\"countries1 is a superset of countries2\")\n    else:\n        print(\"countries1 is not a superset of countries2\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `is_superset` that checks if `dict1` is a superset of `dict2`.\n2. We create two dictionaries, `countries1` and `countries2`, with country names as keys and their capitals as values.\n3. In the `main` function, we call `is_superset` with `countries1` and `countries2` as arguments and print the result.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will check if `countries1` is a superset of `countries2` and print the result. In this case, since `countries1` contains all the key-value pairs of `countries2`, it will print \"countries1 is a superset of countries2\".",
