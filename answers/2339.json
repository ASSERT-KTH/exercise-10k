  "prompt": "Write a program to print a list of numbers from 1 to 10 to the screen, but only include numbers that are greater than 5.",
  "answer": "**Filtering Numbers Greater than 5**\n\nHere's a Python program that prints a list of numbers from 1 to 10, filtering out numbers less than or equal to 5.\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers_greater_than_five():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a list of numbers from 1 to 10, excluding numbers less than or equal to 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    numbers = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i > 5]\n    print(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_numbers_greater_than_five()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define a function `print_numbers_greater_than_five` that generates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.\n2. We use a list comprehension to filter the numbers, only including those greater than 5.\n3. The `range` function generates numbers from 1 to 10 (the upper limit is exclusive, so we use 11).\n4. The `if i > 5` condition filters out numbers less than or equal to 5.\n\n**Output:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the following list of numbers:\n\n```\n[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```",
