  "answer": "**First Duplicate Finder Program**\n====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate in a given list, i.e., the first element that appears more than once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The first duplicate element if found, None otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\n    if duplicate:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements we've encountered so far.\n2. We iterate through the input list `lst`.\n3. For each element, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, we return that element as the first duplicate.\n5. If not, we add the element to the `seen` set and continue to the next element.\n6. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each element in the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
