It uses a try-except block to ensure that the user enters valid numbers.\n2. **Perform Arithmetic Operation**: The `perform_arithmetic_operation` function takes in the two numbers and the operator, and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. It also checks for invalid operators and division by zero.\n3. **Main Function**: The `main` function calls `get_user_input` to get the user's input, and then calls `perform_arithmetic_operation` to perform the operation. It also handles any exceptions that may occur during the operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Addition: Enter `2` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `+` as the operator. The output will be `2 + 3 = 5.0`.\n* Subtraction: Enter `5` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `-` as the operator. The output will be `5 - 2 = 3.0`.\n* Multiplication: Enter `4` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` as the operator. The output will be `4 * 5 = 20.0`.\n* Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` as the operator. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
