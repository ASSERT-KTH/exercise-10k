  "answer": "**Calculating Distance Between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates. It uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding coordinates.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It calculates the differences between the corresponding coordinates using subtraction.\n3. It squares these differences using the exponentiation operator (`** 2`).\n4. It sums these squared differences using the addition operator (`+`).\n5. It takes the square root of this sum using the `math.sqrt` function.\n6. The result is returned as a float value.\n7. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_distance` function with two points (1, 2) and (4, 6).\n8. The calculated distance is printed to the console with two decimal places using an f-string.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). This will output the distance between the two points (1, 2) and (4, 6). You can modify the `point1` and `point2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the distance between different points.",
