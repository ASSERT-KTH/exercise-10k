  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and an integer as input, and returns the rotated string, where the last n characters are moved to the beginning of the string.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef rotate_string(s, n):\n    return s[-n:] + s[:-n]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(rotate_string(\"python\", 2))  # Expected output: \"onpyth\"\n```\nThis code defines the `rotate_string` function as described, which takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input and returns the rotated string. The function uses slicing to extract the last `n` characters and the rest of the string, and concatenates them in the desired order. The test case demonstrates the function's behavior, rotating the string \"python\" by 2 characters to produce the output \"onpyth\".",
