  "prompt": "Write a program that converts a given amount of money from one currency to another using a fixed exchange rate.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a given amount of money from one currency to another using a fixed exchange rate.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (float): The amount of money to be converted.\n        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate between the two currencies.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The converted amount of money.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the amount and exchange rate are valid\n    if amount < 0 or exchange_rate <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input. Amount must be non-negative and exchange rate must be positive.\")\n\n    # Convert the currency\n    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate\n\n    return converted_amount\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    amount = 100  # Amount of money to be converted\n    exchange_rate = 1.31  # Exchange rate between USD and CAD (1 USD = 1.31 CAD)\n\n    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate)\n\n    print(f\"{amount} USD is equal to {converted_amount} CAD\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `convert_currency` function takes two arguments: `amount` and `exchange_rate`. It checks if the `amount` is non-negative and the `exchange_rate` is positive, raising a `ValueError` if either condition is not met.\n*   The function then converts the `amount` by multiplying it with the `exchange_rate` and returns the converted amount.\n*   In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `convert_currency` function. We define the `amount` to be converted and the `exchange_rate` between USD and CAD. The converted amount is then printed to the console.\n*   The program uses a fixed exchange rate, which is the current exchange rate between the two currencies at the time of writing. In a real-world application, you would likely fetch the latest exchange rate from a reliable source, such as an API or a financial database.",
