  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing Student Information\n\nBelow is an example of how to declare variables for a student's name and age, then print out the stored information using Python.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables for student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the stored information\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach Using a Dictionary\n\nIf you have multiple students or want a more structured approach, consider using a dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Declare a dictionary to store student information\nstudent_info = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 20\n}\n\n# Print out the stored information\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_info[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_info[\"age\"])\n```\n\nThis will produce the same output as the previous example. The dictionary approach is useful for storing and accessing more complex data structures.",
