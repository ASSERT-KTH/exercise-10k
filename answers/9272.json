  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should take two numbers and an operation as input and return the result. The operations to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define functions for each operation\ndef addition(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtraction(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiplication(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef division(x, y):\n    return x / y\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        result = addition(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        result = subtraction(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        result = multiplication(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = division(num1, num2)\n        else:\n            result = \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    else:\n        result = \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    # Loop back to the main function\n    main()\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic operation functions, a `main` function that gets user input, performs the operation, and prints the result, and calls the `main` function to start the program. The program will continue to loop until the user stops it manually.",
