Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n2.  Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, if the characters at positions `i - 1` and `j - 1` in `str1` and `str2` are equal, set `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, set `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array by tracing back the path from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence as a string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n--------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n---------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), as we need to store the 2D array `dp` with dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1).",
