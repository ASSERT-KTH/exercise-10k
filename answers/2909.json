  "answer": "**Character Occurrence Counter Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_character(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n\n    count = count_character(string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count} times in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_character` function takes a string and a character as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `count` method of the string to count the occurrences of the character.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `count_character` function.\n4. It prompts the user to enter a string and a character.\n5. It calls the `count_character` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Counting the occurrences of a specific letter in a word or phrase.\n* Counting the occurrences of a punctuation mark in a sentence.\n* Counting the occurrences of a digit in a numerical string.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `character_counter.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python character_counter.py`).\n3. Follow the prompts to enter a string and a character.\n4. The program will print the number of occurrences of the character in the string.",
