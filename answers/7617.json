  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user to guess a random number until they guess correctly.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_random_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user to guess the number\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n\n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess < random_number:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > random_number:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_random_number()\n```\n\n### How the program works:\n\n1. **Generate a random number**: The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint()` function.\n2. **Initialize the number of attempts**: The program sets a variable `attempts` to 0 to track the number of guesses made by the user.\n3. **Enter a while loop**: The program enters a while loop that continues to execute until the user guesses the random number correctly.\n4. **Ask the user to guess**: Inside the while loop, the program asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 using the `input()` function.\n5. **Validate the input**: The program checks if the user's input is a valid integer using a try-except block. If the input is not a valid integer, the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n6. **Check the guess**: The program checks if the user's guess is less than, greater than, or equal to the random number. If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint (e.g., \"Too low! Try again.\") and increments the `attempts` variable.\n7. **Exit the loop**: If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a congratulatory message indicating the number of attempts taken to guess the number and exits the while loop.\n\n### Example usage:\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `guess_random_number.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python guess_random_number.py`). The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!",
