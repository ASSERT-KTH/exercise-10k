  "prompt": "Create a program that allows the user to add, remove, and search for phone numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that allows users to add, remove, and search for phone numbers:\n\n```python\n# phone_book.py\n\nclass PhoneBook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.phone_book = {}\n\n    def add_number(self, name, phone_number):\n        \"\"\"Add a phone number to the phone book.\"\"\"\n        self.phone_book[name] = phone_number\n        print(f\"Phone number for {name} added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_number(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Remove a phone number from the phone book.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            del self.phone_book[name]\n            print(f\"Phone number for {name} removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No phone number found for {name}.\")\n\n    def search_number(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Search for a phone number in the phone book.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phone_book:\n            print(f\"Phone number for {name}: {self.phone_book[name]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No phone number found for {name}.\")\n\n    def display_phone_book(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all phone numbers in the phone book.\"\"\"\n        if self.phone_book:\n            print(\"Phone Book:\")\n            for name, phone_number in self.phone_book.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {phone_number}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Phone book is empty.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    phone_book = PhoneBook()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPhone Book Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add phone number\")\n        print(\"2. Remove phone number\")\n        print(\"3. Search phone number\")\n        print(\"4. Display phone book\")\n        print(\"5. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter name: \")\n            phone_number = input(\"Enter phone number: \")\n            phone_book.add_number(name, phone_number)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter name: \")\n            phone_book.remove_number(name)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            name = input(\"Enter name: \")\n            phone_book.search_number(name)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            phone_book.display_phone_book()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python phone_book.py`).\n2. The program will display a menu with options to add, remove, search, display, or quit.\n3. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.\n4. Follow the prompts to add, remove, or search for phone numbers.\n5. To quit the program, choose option 5.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Add a phone number: Choose option 1, enter the name and phone number, and the program will add it to the phone book.\n* Remove a phone number: Choose option 2, enter the name, and the program will remove the corresponding phone number from the phone book.\n* Search for a phone number: Choose option 3, enter the name, and the program will display the corresponding phone number if found.\n* Display phone book: Choose option 4 to display all phone numbers in the phone book.",
