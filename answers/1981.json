  "prompt": "Write a program to determine if a given number is even or odd using conditional statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that determines whether a number is even or odd using a conditional statement:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is odd.\")\n\n# Example usage\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\nHere's how this program works:\n\n1. We define a function `check_even_odd` that takes one argument `num`.\n2. Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if `num` is even.\n   - If `num` divided by 2 leaves no remainder (`num % 2 == 0`), then `num` is even.\n   - Otherwise, `num` is odd.\n3. Based on whether `num` is even or odd, we print a corresponding message.\n4. Finally, we ask the user to enter a number and pass it to our function for checking.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a number when prompted, and it will tell you whether the number is even or odd.",
