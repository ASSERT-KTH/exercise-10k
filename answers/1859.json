  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the elements from the input list, but with the inner lists flattened.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef flatten(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in lst:\n        result += i\n    return result\n\ntest_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(flatten(test_list))\n```\nThis code defines the `flatten` function, which takes a list of lists of integers as input and returns a new list with the inner lists flattened. The function uses a loop to iterate over each inner list in the input list, and the `+=` operator to extend the `result` list with the elements of each inner list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list.\n\nThe code also includes a test case, where the `test_list` variable is defined as a list of three inner lists, and the `flatten` function is called with this list as input. The result is printed to the console, which should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input list is a list of lists of integers, and does not include any error checking or handling for invalid input.",
