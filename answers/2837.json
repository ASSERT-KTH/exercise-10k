  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the income. It uses a tiered tax system with three tax brackets:\n\n* 20% for income above $50,000\n* 15% for income between $20,000 and $50,000\n* 10% for income below $20,000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the tax amount based on the income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income > 50000:\n        tax_rate = 0.20\n    elif 20000 <= income <= 50000:\n        tax_rate = 0.15\n    else:\n        tax_rate = 0.10\n\n    tax_amount = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_amount\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax amount is: ${tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your net income is: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted (e.g., 60000).\n3. The program will calculate and display your tax amount and net income.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_tax` function takes an income as input and returns the calculated tax amount.\n* The `main` function prompts the user for their income, calculates the tax amount, and displays the result.\n* The tax amount is calculated by multiplying the income by the applicable tax rate.\n* The net income is calculated by subtracting the tax amount from the income.",
