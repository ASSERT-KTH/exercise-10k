  "prompt": "Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program should take two numbers and an operation as input and produce the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get user input for the first number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n            \n    # Get user input for the operation\n    while True:\n        operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if operation in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid operation.
