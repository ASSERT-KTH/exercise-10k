  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of the selection sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the minimum element's index\n        min_idx = i\n        \n        # Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        \n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    \n    return arr\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define an example array\n    example_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    \n    print(\"Original array:\", example_array)\n    \n    # Sort the array using selection sort\n    sorted_array = selection_sort(example_array)\n    \n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_array)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `selection_sort` function takes an array of integers as input and sorts it using the selection sort algorithm.\n*   It iterates through each element in the array, finds the minimum element in the unsorted part, and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.\n*   The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Time Complexity\n*   The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n*   This is because for each element, we potentially scan the entire array to find the minimum.\n\n### Space Complexity\n*   The space complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(1), which means it requires constant additional space.\n*   This is because we only need a few extra variables to store indices and temporary swap values, regardless of the input size.",
