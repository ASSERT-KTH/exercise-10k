  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the tax based on the income using conditional statements.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate tax based on income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif income <= 10000:\n        # 10% tax for income up to $10,000\n        return income * 0.10\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        # 15% tax for income between $10,001 and $20,000\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 10000) * 0.15)\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        # 20% tax for income between $20,001 and $50,000\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + (10000 * 0.15) + ((income - 20000) * 0.20)\n    else:\n        # 25% tax for income above $50,000\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + (10000 * 0.15) + (30000 * 0.20) + ((income - 50000) * 0.25)\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes an `income` parameter and returns the calculated tax.\n2. The function uses conditional statements to determine the tax rate based on the income.\n3. The tax rates are as follows:\n\t* 10% for income up to $10,000\n\t* 15% for income between $10,001 and $20,000\n\t* 20% for income between $20,001 and $50,000\n\t* 25% for income above $50,000\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their income, calculates the tax using the `calculate_tax` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter an income of $15,000 to calculate a tax of $1,500 (10% of $10,000 + 15% of $5,000)\n* Enter an income of $30,000 to calculate a tax of $4,000 (10% of $10,000 + 15% of $10,000 + 20% of $10,000)\n* Enter an income of $60,000 to calculate a tax of $11,000 (10% of $10,000 + 15% of $10,000 + 20% of $30,000 + 25% of $10,000)",
