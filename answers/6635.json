  "answer": "**Error Handling Function**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that uses error handling to catch and handle exceptions. This function attempts to divide two numbers and handles potential exceptions that may occur.\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and handle potential exceptions.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The dividend.\n        num2 (float): The divisor.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The quotient of num1 and num2.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If either num1 or num2 is not a number.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If num2 is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to divide num1 by num2\n        quotient = num1 / num2\n        return quotient\n\n    except TypeError:\n        # Handle TypeError if either num1 or num2 is not a number\n        print(\"Error: Both inputs must be numbers.\")\n        return None\n\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        # Handle ZeroDivisionError if num2 is zero\n        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return None\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any other unexpected exceptions\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(divide_numbers(10, 2))  # Expected output: 5.0\n    print(divide_numbers(10, 0))  # Expected output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.\n    print(divide_numbers(\"ten\", 2))  # Expected output: Error: Both inputs must be numbers.\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `divide_numbers` function takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and attempts to divide `num1` by `num2`.\n2.  The `try` block contains the code that may potentially raise an exception.\n3.  The `except` blocks catch specific exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `try` block.\n    *   `TypeError` is caught if either `num1` or `num2` is not a number.\n    *   `ZeroDivisionError` is caught if `num2` is zero.\n    *   A general `Exception` is caught to handle any other unexpected exceptions.\n4.  In each `except` block, an error message is printed, and `None` is returned to indicate that an error occurred.\n5.  In the example usage section, the function is called with different inputs to demonstrate how it handles various scenarios.\n\n**Best Practices**\n------------------\n\n*   Always anticipate potential exceptions that may occur in your code and handle them accordingly.\n*   Use specific exception types to catch expected errors, and use a general `Exception` to catch any unexpected errors.\n*   Provide informative error messages to help users understand what went wrong.\n*   Keep the code within the `try` block as minimal as possible to avoid catching unrelated exceptions.",
