The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `-` as the operation, `10` as the first number, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 - 5 = 5.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `*` as the operation, `10` as the first number, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 * 5 = 50.0`.\n*   Division: Enter `/` as the operation, `10` as the first number, and `2` as the second number. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Take the operation as input from the user.\n2.  Check if the operation is valid. If not, prompt the user to enter a valid operation.\n3.  Take the numbers as input from the user.\n4.  Check if the inputs are numbers. If not, prompt the user to enter a number.\n5.  Perform the operation based on the user's input.\n6.  If the operation is division, check for division by zero. If the second number is zero, prompt the user to enter a non-zero number.\n7.  Print the result of the operation.",
