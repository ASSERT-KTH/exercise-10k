  "prompt": "Write a function to convert ogg files to mp3 using a given conversion tool.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution using the `pydub` library to convert ogg files to mp3. This solution assumes you have the `ffmpeg` tool installed.\n\n```python\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nimport os\n\ndef convert_ogg_to_mp3(ogg_file_path, mp3_file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an ogg file to an mp3 file.\n\n    Args:\n        ogg_file_path (str): The path to the ogg file.\n        mp3_file_path (str): The path to the output mp3 file.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input file exists\n    if not os.path.exists(ogg_file_path):\n        raise FileNotFoundError(\"Input file not found\")\n\n    # Check if the output file already exists\n    if os.path.exists(mp3_file_path):\n        print(\"Output file already exists. Overwriting...\")\n\n    # Convert the ogg file to mp3\n    sound = AudioSegment.from_ogg(ogg_file_path)\n    sound.export(mp3_file_path, format=\"mp3\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ogg_file_path = \"input.ogg\"\n    mp3_file_path = \"output.mp3\"\n    convert_ogg_to_mp3(ogg_file_path, mp3_file_path)\n```\n\nBefore running the above code, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install pydub\n```\n\nYou also need to have the `ffmpeg` tool installed on your system. You can download it from the official `ffmpeg` website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html\n\nAlternatively, if you're on a Linux system, you can install `ffmpeg` using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n```\n\nThis solution does not use a specific conversion tool, but instead relies on the `ffmpeg` tool, which is a powerful and widely-used tool for audio and video processing. The `pydub` library provides a convenient interface to `ffmpeg`, making it easy to convert audio files between different formats.",
