  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its absolute value.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the absolute value of a given number, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function named 'absolute_value' that takes one argument 'num'.\ndef absolute_value(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the absolute value of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number for which the absolute value is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The absolute value of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input number is less than 0, because absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart.\n    if num < 0:\n        # If the number is negative, multiply it by -1 to make it positive.\n        return -num\n    \n    # If the number is not negative, its absolute value is the number itself.\n    return num\n\n# Test the function with some examples.\nprint(absolute_value(-5))  # Output: 5\nprint(absolute_value(10))  # Output: 10\nprint(absolute_value(-3.5))  # Output: 3.5\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `absolute_value` takes one argument `num`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns its absolute value.\n* Inside the function, we check if `num` is less than 0. If it is, we return `-num` to get its absolute value, since the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart.\n* If `num` is not negative, we simply return `num` as its absolute value is the number itself.\n* The function is then tested with some examples, including negative and positive numbers, as well as a decimal number, to demonstrate its functionality.",
