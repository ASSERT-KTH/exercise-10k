  "answer": "**Printing First N Numbers Meeting a Condition**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to print the first N numbers in a list that meet a specific condition (in this case, numbers greater than 3).\n\n```python\ndef print_first_n_numbers(numbers, n, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the first n numbers in the list that meet the given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): The list of numbers to check.\n        n (int): The number of matching numbers to print.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if it meets the condition, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    index = 0\n    while count < n and index < len(numbers):\n        if condition(numbers[index]):\n            print(numbers[index])\n            count += 1\n        index += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nn = 5\ncondition = lambda x: x > 3  # Condition: numbers greater than 3\n\nprint(\"First {} numbers greater than 3:\".format(n))\nprint_first_n_numbers(numbers, n, condition)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `print_first_n_numbers` function takes three arguments:\n   * `numbers`: The list of numbers to check.\n   * `n`: The number of matching numbers to print.\n   * `condition`: A function that takes a number and returns True if it meets the condition, False otherwise.\n2. The function uses two variables: `count` to keep track of the number of matching numbers found, and `index` to iterate over the list of numbers.\n3. The while loop continues until `count` reaches `n` or `index` reaches the end of the list.\n4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current number meets the condition using the `condition` function. If it does, the number is printed and `count` is incremented.\n5. The `index` is incremented at the end of each iteration, regardless of whether the number met the condition or not.\n\n**Example Output**\n----------------\n\n```\nFirst 5 numbers greater than 3:\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n```",
