  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to calculate the number of coins of each denomination needed to make a given amount of change.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the number of coins of each denomination needed to make a given amount of change.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(amount):\n    # Define the coin denominations\n    coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]\n    coin_names = [\"quarters\", \"dimes\", \"nickels\", \"pennies\"]\n    change = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for i, coin in enumerate(coins):\n        # Calculate the number of coins needed for this denomination\n        count = amount // coin\n        amount %= coin\n        change[coin_names[i]] = count\n\n    return change\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the amount of change to make from the user\n    amount = int(input(\"Enter the amount of change to make (in cents): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the change\n    change = calculate_change(amount)\n\n    # Print the change\n    print(\"Change:\")\n    for coin, count in change.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            print(f\"{coin.capitalize()}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define the Coin Denominations**: The `coins` list contains the coin denominations in descending order (25 cents for a quarter, 10 cents for a dime, 5 cents for a nickel, and 1 cent for a penny).\n2. **Iterate Over Each Coin Denomination**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over each coin denomination.\n3. **Calculate the Number of Coins Needed**: For each coin denomination, the program calculates the number of coins needed by performing integer division of the remaining amount by the coin denomination (`amount // coin`).\n4. **Update the Remaining Amount**: The program updates the remaining amount by taking the modulus of the remaining amount by the coin denomination (`amount %= coin`).\n5. **Store the Change**: The program stores the change in a dictionary (`change`) where the keys are the coin names and the values are the number of coins needed.\n6. **Print the Change**: The program prints the change by iterating over the `change` dictionary and printing the coin name and the number of coins needed.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf the user enters 37 cents, the program will output:\n```\nChange:\nQuarters: 1\nDimes: 1\nPennies: 2\n```\nThis indicates that the user needs 1 quarter (25 cents), 1 dime (10 cents), and 2 pennies (2 cents) to make 37 cents in change.",
