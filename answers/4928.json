  "prompt": "Write a program that converts a given amount of one currency to another given the exchange rate. The program should use the formula converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate to calculate the converted amount.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a given amount of one currency to another given the exchange rate.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (float): The amount of currency to be converted.\n        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate between the two currencies.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The converted amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate\n    return converted_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount of currency to be converted: \"))\n    exchange_rate = float(input(\"Enter the exchange rate: \"))\n    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate)\n    print(f\"{amount} converted to the other currency is {converted_amount}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `convert_currency` function takes in two parameters: `amount` and `exchange_rate`.\n* It calculates the `converted_amount` by multiplying the `amount` and `exchange_rate` using the formula `converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate`.\n* The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `convert_currency` function. It prompts the user to enter the amount and exchange rate, calls the `convert_currency` function, and then prints the result.\n* The program uses `float` to handle decimal numbers, which is common in currency exchange rates.\n* The program also includes a docstring for the `convert_currency` function to provide documentation and make the code more readable.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the amount of currency to be converted when prompted.\n3. Enter the exchange rate when prompted.\n4. The program will print the converted amount.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the amount of currency to be converted: 100\nEnter the exchange rate: 1.25\n100.0 converted to the other currency is 125.0\n```",
