It has methods to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display tasks.\n*   Tasks are stored in a list as dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the task description and its completion status.\n*   The `main` function provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the task manager.\n*   The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.\n*   It handles invalid inputs and provides feedback to the user for each action.\n\n### Example Usage\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to add a task. Enter the task description when prompted.\n3.  Choose option 4 to display the tasks. You should see the task you just added.\n4.  Choose option 3 to mark a task as completed. Enter the task number when prompted.\n5.  Choose option 4 again to display the tasks. The task you marked as completed should be displayed as completed.\n6.  Choose option 2 to remove a task. Enter the task number when prompted.\n7.  Choose option 4 again to display the tasks. The task you removed should no longer be in the list.\n8.  Choose option 5 to exit the program.",
