  "answer": "### Last Occurrence Index Function\n#### Description\nThis function takes a list and a value as input, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in the list if it exists. If the value does not exist in the list, it returns -1.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef last_occurrence_index(lst, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in the list if it exists.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        value: The value to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the last occurrence of the value, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if lst[i] == value:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n    value = 2\n    index = last_occurrence_index(lst, value)\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"The last occurrence of {value} is at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{value} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function iterates over the input list in reverse order. When it encounters the specified value, it immediately returns the index of that occurrence. If it iterates over the entire list without finding the value, it returns -1 to indicate that the value was not found.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because in the worst case it must iterate over the entire list.",
