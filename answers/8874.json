  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the quotient of two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The quotient of the two numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend / divisor\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        quotient = calculate_quotient(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The quotient of {dividend} and {divisor} is {quotient}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient` function takes two numbers as input, `dividend` and `divisor`, and returns their quotient.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero to prevent a division by zero error.\n3. If the `divisor` is not zero, it calculates and returns the quotient.\n4. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers.\n5. It then calls the `calculate_quotient` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n6. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Calculate the quotient of 10 and 2: `calculate_quotient(10, 2)` returns `5.0`.\n* Calculate the quotient of 10 and 0: `calculate_quotient(10, 0)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.",
