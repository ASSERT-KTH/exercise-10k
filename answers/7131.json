  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, then multiplies the result by 3 and finally subtracts 10 from it. Use variables to store the intermediate results and print the final result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define variables\na = 5\nb = 10\n\n# Calculate intermediate results\nres_1 = a + b\nres_2 = res_1 * 3\nres_3 = res_2 - 10\n\n# Print final result\nprint(res_3)\n```\nThis code defines the variables `a` and `b` with values 5 and 10, respectively. It then calculates the intermediate results `res_1`, `res_2`, and `res_3` using the specified operations. Finally, it prints the value of `res_3`, which is the final result.",
