  "answer": "**Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the body mass index (BMI) of a person based on their height and weight. It then categorizes the person into one of the following BMI categories:\n- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)\n- Normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9)\n- Overweight (BMI = 25-29.9)\n- Obese (BMI \u2265 30)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the body mass index (BMI) of a person.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): The weight of the person in kilograms.\n        height (float): The height of the person in meters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated BMI.\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef categorize_bmi(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Categorize the person into one of the BMI categories.\n\n    Args:\n        bmi (float): The calculated BMI.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding BMI category.\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal weight\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kilograms: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n    category = categorize_bmi(bmi)\n\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"You are: {category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the script and follow the prompts to enter your weight and height. The program will then calculate and display your BMI and corresponding category.\n\n```\nEnter your weight in kilograms: 70\nEnter your height in meters: 1.75\nYour BMI is: 22.86\nYou are: Normal weight\n```\n\nNote: This program uses the World Health Organization (WHO) BMI categories. The BMI calculation is based on the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2.",
