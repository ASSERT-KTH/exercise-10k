  "answer": "**Meal Cost Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of a meal, including a tip. It takes the cost of the meal and the desired tip percentage as input, and returns the total cost.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a meal, including a tip.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The desired tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal, including the tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Meal Cost Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the desired tip percentage (e.g. 15, 20): \"))\n\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    print(f\"Meal cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip ({tip_percentage}%): ${total_cost - meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal when prompted (e.g. `25.99`).\n3. Enter the desired tip percentage when prompted (e.g. `20`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the total cost of the meal, including the tip.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_total_cost` function takes the meal cost and tip percentage as input, calculates the tip amount, and returns the total cost.\n* The `main` function prompts the user for input, calls the `calculate_total_cost` function, and displays the results.\n* The program uses Python's built-in `float` type to handle decimal numbers, and the `input` function to get user input.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to display the results with two decimal places.",
