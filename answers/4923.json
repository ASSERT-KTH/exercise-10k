  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. The program should use the formula A = \u03c0r^2 to calculate the area.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```python\n# import the math module for mathematical functions\nimport math\n\n# define a function called area that takes one parameter: radius\ndef area(radius):\n    # calculate the area using the formula A = \u03c0r^2\n    A = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    \n    # return the calculated area\n    return A\n\n# call the area function with radius = 5\nprint(area(5))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units and print the result.",
