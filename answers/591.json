  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subarray:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_sum(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a subarray.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A list of integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The maximum sum of a subarray.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum sum and the current sum to the first element of the array\n    max_sum = current_sum = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element\n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        # Update the current sum to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous current sum\n        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)\n        \n        # Update the maximum sum to be the maximum of the current maximum sum and the current sum\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n    # Return the maximum sum\n    return max_sum\n\n# Test the function\narr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]\nprint(max_subarray_sum(arr))  # Output: 7\n```\n\nIn this program, the `max_subarray_sum` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a subarray. The function uses Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a subarray.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1.  Initialize the maximum sum and the current sum to the first element of the array.\n2.  Iterate over the array starting from the second element.\n3.  For each element, update the current sum to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous current sum.\n4.  Update the maximum sum to be the maximum of the current maximum sum and the current sum.\n5.  Return the maximum sum.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, making it very efficient for large arrays.\n\nIn the test case, the input array is `[-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]`, and the output is `7`, which is the maximum sum of a subarray (`[4, -1, -2, 1, 5]`).",
