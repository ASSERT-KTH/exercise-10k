  "prompt": "Create a program to determine the type of a bank account based on the account balance. If the account balance is above $10000, it is a premium account. If the account balance is between $1000 and $10000, it is a standard account. If the account balance is below $1000, it is a basic account.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef determine_account_type(balance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the type of a bank account based on the account balance.\n\n    Args:\n        balance (float): The account balance.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The type of the bank account.\n    \"\"\"\n    if balance > 10000:\n        return \"Premium\"\n    elif 1000 <= balance <= 10000:\n        return \"Standard\"\n    else:\n        return \"Basic\"\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    balance = float(input(\"Enter the account balance: $\"))\n    account_type = determine_account_type(balance)\n    print(f\"The account type is: {account_type}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `determine_account_type` function takes the account balance as input and returns the type of the bank account.\n*   The function uses if-elif-else statements to check the account balance and determine the account type.\n*   The `main` function is used to get the account balance from the user and print the account type.\n*   The program uses a simple and straightforward approach to solve the problem.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This program assumes that the account balance is a non-negative number. You may want to add error checking to handle negative balances.\n*   You can modify the program to use a dictionary or a list to store the account types and their corresponding balance ranges.\n*   Consider adding more account types or modifying the existing balance ranges based on your specific requirements.",
