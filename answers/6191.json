  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the string with the specified character removed from the beginning and end.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that removes a specified character from the beginning and end of a given string. This function will help you process strings by stripping unwanted characters. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_char(s, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function removes the specified character from the beginning and end of a given string.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string.\n    c (str): The character to be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The string with the specified character removed from the beginning and end.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We will use a while loop to continuously remove the character from the start of the string until it's no longer there\n    while s and s[0] == c:\n        # If the string is not empty and the first character is the one we want to remove, we remove it\n        s = s[1:]\n\n    # We will use another while loop to continuously remove the character from the end of the string until it's no longer there\n    while s and s[-1] == c:\n        # If the string is not empty and the last character is the one we want to remove, we remove it\n        s = s[:-1]\n\n    # Finally, we return the modified string\n    return s\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_char` takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `c` (the character to be removed). It uses while loops to remove the specified character from the start and end of the string.\n* The first while loop checks if the string `s` is not empty and its first character `s[0]` is equal to the character `c`. If both conditions are met, it removes the first character by slicing the string (`s = s[1:]`).\n* The second while loop performs a similar check for the last character of the string `s[-1]`. If it matches the character `c`, it removes the last character by slicing the string (`s = s[:-1]`).\n* Finally, the function returns the modified string `s` after removing the specified character from both ends.",
