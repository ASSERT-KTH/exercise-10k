  "prompt": "Create a program that takes three numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. The program should then output the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, z;\n    int resultAdd, resultSub, resultMult, resultDiv;\n\n    cout << \"Enter three numbers (x, y, z): \";\n    cin >> x >> y >> z;\n\n    resultAdd = x + y + z;\n    resultSub = x - y - z;\n    resultMult = x * y * z;\n    resultDiv = x / y / z;\n\n    cout << \"Addition: \" << resultAdd << endl;\n    cout << \"Subtraction: \" << resultSub << endl;\n    cout << \"Multiplication: \" << resultMult << endl;\n    cout << \"Division: \" << resultDiv << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications and included all the details mentioned.",
