  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the price of an item and the tax rate as input and outputs the total price.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the total price of an item after tax:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_price(price, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total price of an item after tax.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The price of the item.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total price of the item after tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    total_price = price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the price and tax rate from the user\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price of the item: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 8 for 8%): \"))\n    tax_rate /= 100  # Convert the tax rate to a decimal\n\n    # Calculate and display the total price\n    total_price = calculate_total_price(price, tax_rate)\n    print(f\"The total price of the item is: ${total_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_total_price` function takes the price of the item and the tax rate as input, calculates the tax amount by multiplying the price by the tax rate, and then adds the tax amount to the price to get the total price.\n2. The `main` function gets the price and tax rate from the user, converts the tax rate to a decimal, and then calls the `calculate_total_price` function to calculate the total price.\n3. The total price is then displayed to the user, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the price of the item: $100\nEnter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 8 for 8%): 8\nThe total price of the item is: $108.00\n```",
