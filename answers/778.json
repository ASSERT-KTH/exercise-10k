  "answer": "Here is a Python program that counts the occurrences of a given character in a string:\n\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given character in a string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    string (str): The string to search in.\n    char (str): The character to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the string and character from the user\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of the character\n    count = count_char(string, char)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' occurs {count} times in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `count_char` function takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string using the `count` method of the string.\n* The `main` function gets the string and character from the user, calls the `count_char` function, and prints the result.\n* The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the main logic and an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a string, such as \"hello world\".\n* Enter a character, such as \"l\".\n* The program will print \"The character 'l' occurs 3 times in the string.\"",
