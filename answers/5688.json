  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the age as input and checks if the person is eligible to vote using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes age as input and checks if a person is eligible to vote:\n\n```python\n# Take age as input from the user\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n\n# Check if the person is eligible to vote\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we first take the age as input from the user using the `input()` function. The `input()` function returns a string, so we convert it to an integer using `int()`.\n\nThen, we use an `if` statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, we print \"You are eligible to vote.\" Otherwise, we print \"You are not eligible to vote.\" \n\nNote: The voting age may vary in different countries. This program assumes that the voting age is 18.",
