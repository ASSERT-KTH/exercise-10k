  "answer": "**Bouncing Ball Simulator**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a bouncing ball using a while loop. The program models the ball's motion, taking into account its initial velocity, gravity, and elasticity (bounciness).\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Constants\nGRAVITY = 9.81  # m/s^2\nELASTICITY = 0.7  # coefficient of restitution (0 = perfectly inelastic, 1 = perfectly elastic)\n\nclass Ball:\n    def __init__(self, initial_height, initial_velocity):\n        self.height = initial_height\n        self.velocity = initial_velocity\n\n    def update(self, dt):\n        self.velocity += -GRAVITY * dt\n        self.height += self.velocity * dt\n\n        if self.height < 0:\n            self.height = 0\n            self.velocity = -self.velocity * ELASTICITY\n\n    def print_state(self):\n        print(f\"Height: {self.height:.2f} m, Velocity: {self.velocity:.2f} m/s\")\n\ndef main():\n    initial_height = 10  # m\n    initial_velocity = 0  # m/s\n    dt = 0.01  # s (time step)\n\n    ball = Ball(initial_height, initial_velocity)\n\n    while ball.height > 0 and ball.velocity != 0:\n        ball.update(dt)\n        ball.print_state()\n        time.sleep(dt)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines a `Ball` class with attributes for height and velocity.\n2. The `update` method updates the ball's state based on the current velocity and gravity.\n3. If the ball hits the ground (height < 0), the velocity is reversed and reduced by the elasticity factor.\n4. The `print_state` method prints the current height and velocity of the ball.\n5. In the `main` function, a ball object is created with an initial height and velocity.\n6. The program enters a while loop, where it updates the ball's state, prints the current state, and waits for the specified time step (`dt`) before repeating.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nRun the program to simulate a bouncing ball with an initial height of 10 meters and an initial velocity of 0 meters per second. The program will print the ball's height and velocity at each time step, demonstrating the bouncing motion.",
