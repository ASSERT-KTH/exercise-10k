  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. Use if/else statements to determine the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a year is a leap year:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    if year % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    elif year % 100 != 0:\n        return True\n    elif year % 400 != 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n1. **Get User Input**: The program asks the user to enter a year using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer.\n2. **Check Leap Year Conditions**: The `is_leap_year()` function checks the conditions for a leap year:\n   - A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.\n   - This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n3. **Use if/else Statements to Determine the Result**: The program uses if/else statements to check the conditions and return `True` if the year is a leap year and `False` otherwise.\n4. **Print the Result**: Finally, the program prints whether the entered year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- Enter a year that is a leap year, such as 2020 or 2000.\n- Enter a year that is not a leap year, such as 2019 or 1900.",
