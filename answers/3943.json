  "prompt": "Write a program to generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, print out a message indicating if the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the player has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. It first generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. It then enters a loop where it continually asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program will reveal the number and exit.\n4. The program attempts to convert the user's guess to an integer. If this fails (because the user didn't type a number), it will print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess, it will print a message indicating this and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n6. If the user's guess is equal to the number to guess, it will print a congratulatory message and exit the loop.",
