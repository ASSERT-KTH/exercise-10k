  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Program**\n=====================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD.\n3. The algorithm iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n4. The GCD is the absolute value of `a` when `b` becomes 0.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `gcd` function with two numbers and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the GCD of two numbers: `gcd(12, 15)` returns `3`\n* Find the GCD of two numbers with a common factor: `gcd(24, 30)` returns `6`\n* Find the GCD of two numbers with no common factors: `gcd(7, 11)` returns `1`",
