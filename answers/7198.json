  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user. The game continues to run until the user chooses to quit.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n        user_choice = user_choice.lower()\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \")\n            user_choice = user_choice.lower()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(\"You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins!\")\n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to continue or 'n' to quit.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a while loop to continue playing until the user chooses to quit.\n* The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n* The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\n* The program includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid choice.",
