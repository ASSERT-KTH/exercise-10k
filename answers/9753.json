  "answer": "**Calculating the Surface Area of a Sphere**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the surface area of a sphere.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula to calculate the surface area of a sphere is:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * r^2\n\nWhere:\n- A is the surface area of the sphere\n- \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14159\n- r is the radius of the sphere\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_surface_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a sphere.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the sphere is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `calculate_surface_area` function takes the radius of the sphere as input and returns the surface area.\n- The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere, calculates the surface area using the `calculate_surface_area` function, and prints the result.\n- The program uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of pi and the `**` operator for exponentiation.\n- The program also includes error handling to ensure that the radius is not negative.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the sphere when prompted (e.g., 5).\n3. The program will calculate and display the surface area of the sphere (e.g., 314.16).",
