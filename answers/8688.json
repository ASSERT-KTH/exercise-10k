  "answer": "**Web Scraping Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program uses Python and the BeautifulSoup library to scrape a simple website and extract relevant information.\n\n**Requirements**\n---------------\n\n* Python 3.x\n* `beautifulsoup4` library\n* `requests` library\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef scrape_website(url):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrapes a website and extracts relevant information.\n\n    Args:\n        url (str): The URL of the website to scrape.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the extracted information.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the website\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        # Check if the request was successful\n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve website. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n            return None\n\n        # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n        # Extract relevant information\n        title = soup.title.text\n        headings = [h.text for h in soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3'])]\n        links = [a.get('href') for a in soup.find_all('a') if a.get('href')]\n\n        # Return the extracted information as a dictionary\n        return {\n            'title': title,\n            'headings': headings,\n            'links': links\n        }\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = \"http://example.com\"\n    scraped_data = scrape_website(url)\n\n    if scraped_data:\n        print(\"Scraped Data:\")\n        print(f\"Title: {scraped_data['title']}\")\n        print(\"Headings:\")\n        for heading in scraped_data['headings']:\n            print(f\"- {heading}\")\n        print(\"Links:\")\n        for link in scraped_data['links']:\n            print(f\"- {link}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The program sends a GET request to the specified URL using the `requests` library.\n2. It checks if the request was successful by checking the status code of the response.\n3. If the request was successful, it parses the HTML content of the response using the `BeautifulSoup` library.\n4. It extracts the title, headings, and links from the parsed HTML content.\n5. It returns the extracted information as a dictionary.\n6. In the example usage, it scrapes the website at the specified URL and prints the extracted information.\n\n**Note**: Before running this program, make sure to replace the `url` variable with the URL of the website you want to scrape. Also, be aware of the website's terms of use and robots.txt file to ensure that web scraping is allowed.",
