  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name, age, and city as input and prints out a formatted string with this information.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name, age, and city as input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    city = input(\"Please enter your city: \")\n    return name, age, city\n\ndef print_user_info(name, age, city):\n    \"\"\"Print out a formatted string with user's information.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Your name is {name}, you are {age} years old, and you live in {city}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    name, age, city = get_user_info()\n    print_user_info(name, age, city)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the `input` function to get the user's name, age, and city, and the `print` function with an f-string to print out a formatted string with this information.\n\nHere's an explanation of how it works:\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to enter their name, age, and city using the `input` function, and returns these values as a tuple.\n2. The `print_user_info` function takes the user's name, age, and city as arguments, and prints out a formatted string with this information using an f-string.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information, and then calls `print_user_info` to print out the formatted string.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block checks if the script is being run directly (i.e., not being imported as a module by another script), and if so, calls the `main` function to start the program.\n\nExample use case:\n\n```\n$ python user_info.py\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nPlease enter your city: New York\nYour name is John, you are 30 years old, and you live in New York.\n```",
