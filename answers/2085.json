  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a set of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a set of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers from the user\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a set of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The average is: {:.2f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a set of numbers separated by spaces, e.g., \"1 2 3 4 5\".\n* The program will calculate and print the average of the numbers.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. The `main` function gets the numbers from the user, converts them to floats, and passes them to the `calculate_average` function.\n3. The result is printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the user will enter a valid set of numbers.\n* If the user enters an empty set of numbers, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n* You can modify the program to handle these cases if needed.",
