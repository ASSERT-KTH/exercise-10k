  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop, and then prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the provided specification:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop\ni = 10\nwhile i >= 1:\n    print(i)\n    i -= 1\n```\n\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including the comments at the top of each section explaining the purpose of the code. The for loop iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number, and the while loop iterates from 10 to 1 and prints each number. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
