  "prompt": "Create a function called 'calculate_factorial' that takes a single integer 'n' as input and returns the factorial of that number. The function should handle cases where 'n' is less than 0, and raise a ValueError with a suitable error message. For 'n' greater than or equal to 0, the function should return the factorial of 'n'.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer, handling cases where the input is less than 0 and providing a suitable error message. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the factorial of a given integer 'n'.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of 'n' if 'n' is greater than or equal to 0.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If 'n' is less than 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input number 'n' is less than 0\n    if n < 0:\n        # If 'n' is less than 0, we raise a ValueError with a suitable error message\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number 'n' cannot be less than 0.\")\n    \n    # If 'n' is 0 or 1, we return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # We initialize a variable 'result' to 1, which will store the factorial of 'n'\n    result = 1\n    \n    # We use a for loop to iterate from 2 to 'n' (inclusive) and calculate the factorial\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # In each iteration, we multiply 'result' by the current number 'i'\n        result *= i\n    \n    # Finally, we return the calculated factorial\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_factorial` first checks if the input number `n` is less than 0, and if so, raises a `ValueError` with a suitable error message.\n* For `n` greater than or equal to 0, it calculates the factorial by initializing a variable `result` to 1 and then using a for loop to iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive), multiplying `result` by the current number `i` in each iteration.\n* The function also handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 1 as the factorial of these numbers is defined to be 1.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated factorial of `n`.",
