  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's account balance and transaction amount as input and returns whether the transaction is valid or not using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    float accountBalance = 1000.0, transactionAmount = 500.0;\n\n    if (accountBalance >= transactionAmount) {\n        cout << \"Transaction is valid\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Transaction is invalid\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `iostream` library, uses the `std` namespace, and defines two float variables `accountBalance` and `transactionAmount`. It then uses an `if` statement to check if the transaction is valid, and prints a message to the console accordingly. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
