  "answer": "**Scrambled Word Generator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a word as input, scrambles its letters, and returns the scrambled version.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a scrambled version of the input word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The input word to be scrambled.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled version of the input word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the word to a list of characters\n    char_list = list(word)\n\n    # Shuffle the list of characters\n    random.shuffle(char_list)\n\n    # Join the shuffled characters back into a string\n    scrambled_word = ''.join(char_list)\n\n    return scrambled_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input word from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n\n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled = scramble_word(word)\n\n    # Print the scrambled word\n    print(\"Scrambled word:\", scrambled)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a word when prompted (e.g., \"hello\").\n3. The program will print the scrambled version of the input word (e.g., \"olleh\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `random.shuffle` function to scramble the letters of the input word.\n* The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list, and joins the shuffled characters back into a string.\n* The `main` function gets the input word from the user, calls the `scramble_word` function, and prints the scrambled word.",
