  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the current hour as input and prints the corresponding time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) based on the following criteria: morning (6-11), afternoon (12-16), evening (17-20), night (21-5) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef print_time_of_day(hour):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the time of day based on the given hour.\n\n    Args:\n        hour (int): The current hour in 24-hour format.\n    \"\"\"\n    if 6 <= hour <= 11:\n        print(\"It's morning.\")\n    elif 12 <= hour <= 16:\n        print(\"It's afternoon.\")\n    elif 17 <= hour <= 20:\n        print(\"It's evening.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's night.\")\n\ndef main():\n    hour = int(input(\"Enter the current hour (0-23): \"))\n    print_time_of_day(hour)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_time_of_day` function checks the given hour against the specified criteria and prints the corresponding time of day. The `main` function gets the current hour from the user and calls `print_time_of_day`.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes the input hour is in 24-hour format (0-23). If the input hour is in 12-hour format (1-12), you would need to adjust the program accordingly.\n\nAlso, the night range (21-5) is handled by the `else` clause, as it spans two parts of the day (the late evening and the early morning). If the hour is not in the morning, afternoon, or evening ranges, it is considered night.",
