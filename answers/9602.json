  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user is prompted to choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules and displays the result.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their choice and returns it\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): \")\n        if user_choice.capitalize() in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:\n            return user_choice.capitalize()\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to start the game\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to play again or 'n' to quit.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface. The user is expected to enter their choice by typing 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.
