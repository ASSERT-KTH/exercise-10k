  "prompt": "Write a program that sends and receives data over a network",
  "answer": "Here is a simple example of a client-server program in Python that sends and receives data over a network. This example uses the socket library, which is a built-in Python library.\n\n**Server Side (server.py)**\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_server():\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Define the host and port\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 12345\n\n    # Bind the socket to the host and port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Accept an incoming connection\n        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Connection from {address}\")\n\n        # Receive data from the client\n        data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n        print(f\"Received from client: {data.decode()}\")\n\n        # Send response back to the client\n        response = \"Hello from server!\"\n        client_socket.send(response.encode())\n\n        # Close the client socket\n        client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_server()\n```\n\n**Client Side (client.py)**\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_client():\n    # Create a socket object\n    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Define the host and port\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 12345\n\n    # Connect to the server\n    client_socket.connect((host, port))\n    print(f\"Connected to server at {host}:{port}\")\n\n    # Send data to the server\n    data = \"Hello from client!\"\n    client_socket.send(data.encode())\n\n    # Receive response from the server\n    response = client_socket.recv(1024)\n    print(f\"Received from server: {response.decode()}\")\n\n    # Close the client socket\n    client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_client()\n```\n\n**How to Run**\n\n1. Run the server program by executing `python server.py` in your terminal.\n2. In a separate terminal, run the client program by executing `python client.py`.\n3. The client will send a message to the server, and the server will respond with a message.\n4. The client will print the response from the server, and the server will print the message received from the client.\n\nNote: This is a very basic example and does not handle errors or disconnections. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add error handling and other features as needed.",
