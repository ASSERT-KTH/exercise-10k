  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime or not.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime.\n2. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime.\n3. Then it checks if the number has any divisors from 2 to the square root of the number.\n4. If it finds any divisors, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime.\n5. If it doesn't find any divisors, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.\n7. It then prints out whether the number is prime or not.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23, and the program will output \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 24, and the program will output \"24 is not a prime number.\"\n\n**Note**\n------\n\nThis program uses a simple trial division method to check if a number is prime, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized numbers. For larger numbers, more efficient algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.",
