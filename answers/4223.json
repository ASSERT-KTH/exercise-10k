  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. It checks if the list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It calculates the average by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function.\n5. It creates a list of numbers, calculates the average, and prints the result.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). You should see the output: `The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0`.",
