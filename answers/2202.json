  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that takes a user's name as input and prints it to the console:\n\n```python\ndef print_name():\n    # Get user's name\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n    # Print user's name\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Call the function\nprint_name()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_name` function is defined to encapsulate the program's functionality.\n2. Inside the function, the `input` function is used to get the user's name. The string \"Please enter your name: \" is displayed as a prompt.\n3. The user's name is stored in the `name` variable.\n4. The `print` function is used to print a greeting message that includes the user's name.\n5. Finally, the `print_name` function is called to execute the program.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name. If you enter \"John\", it will print \"Hello, John!\" to the console.",
