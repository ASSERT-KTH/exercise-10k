  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is greater than 10. If it is, print 'Greater than 10'. Otherwise, print 'Less than or equal to 10'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specification describes:\n```\nx = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\nif x > 10:\n    print(\"Greater than 10\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Less than or equal to 10\")\n```\nThis code follows the specification exactly, taking an integer input, checking if it's greater than 10, and printing the corresponding message. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
