  "answer": "**First Duplicate Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers. It returns the first number that appears more than once in the list. If no duplicates are found, it returns `None`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or None: The first duplicate number, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we've seen so far.\n2. Iterate over the input list `nums`.\n3. For each number, check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, return the number as it's the first duplicate.\n5. If not, add the number to the `seen` set.\n6. If we reach the end of the list without finding a duplicate, return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each number in the list. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all numbers in the `seen` set.",
