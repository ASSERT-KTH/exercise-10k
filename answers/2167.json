  "answer": "**Calculating Distance Between Two Points**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane and calculates the distance between them using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the coordinates of the two points\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Create tuples to represent the points\n    point1 = (x1, y1)\n    point2 = (x2, y2)\n\n    # Calculate and print the distance\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the coordinates of the two points when prompted.\n3. The program will print the distance between the two points.\n\nExample:\n```\nEnter the x-coordinate of the first point: 1\nEnter the y-coordinate of the first point: 2\nEnter the x-coordinate of the second point: 4\nEnter the y-coordinate of the second point: 6\nThe distance between the two points is: 5.00\n```\nNote: The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)",
