  "answer": "**Finding the Smallest Number in a List**\n\nHere's an example of a Python program that finds the smallest number in a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_smallest_number(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the smallest number in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The smallest number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The list is empty\")\n    return min(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]\nsmallest_number = find_smallest_number(numbers)\nprint(f\"The smallest number in the list is: {smallest_number}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a function called `find_smallest_number` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n2. We check if the list is empty. If it is, we raise a `ValueError` because we can't find the smallest number in an empty list.\n3. We use the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list.\n4. We return the smallest number.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nYou can copy the code into a Python file, run it, and replace the `numbers` list with your own list of numbers to find the smallest number.\n\n**Note**: This code assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list contains non-numeric values, the `min` function will raise a `TypeError`. You may want to add error handling to handle such cases.",
