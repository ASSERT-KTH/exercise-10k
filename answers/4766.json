  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.",
  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year according to the rules:\n\n* The year must be divisible by 4.\n* The year must not be divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    years = [1999, 2000, 1900, 2020]\n\n    for year in years:\n        if is_leap_year(year):\n            print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year.\n2. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check the divisibility of the year by 4, 100, and 400.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `is_leap_year` function with a list of example years.\n\n### Output\n\n```\n1999 is not a leap year.\n2000 is a leap year.\n1900 is not a leap year.\n2020 is a leap year.\n```",
