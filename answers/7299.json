  "answer": "**Factorial Function**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following is a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if the input number is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError` since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   If the input number is 0 or 1, it returns 1, as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n*   For numbers greater than 1, it calculates the factorial using a `for` loop and returns the result.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the factorial of a number.\n\n### Alternative Implementation Using Recursion\n```python\ndef factorial_recursive(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial_recursive(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe recursive implementation can cause a stack overflow for large input numbers due to the recursive call stack. The iterative implementation is generally more efficient and recommended for large inputs.",
