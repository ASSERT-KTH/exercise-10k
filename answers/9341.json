  "answer": "**Variable Lifetime Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the concept of variable lifetime in programming. Variable lifetime refers to the duration for which a variable exists in memory. The lifetime of a variable can be either static, automatic, or dynamic.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Variable Lifetime Program\n\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the concept of variable lifetime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Static variable\n    static_var = 10\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Automatic variable\n        auto_var = 20\n        print(\"Inside inner_function: \")\n        print(f\"Static variable: {static_var}\")\n        print(f\"Automatic variable: {auto_var}\")\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Inside outer_function: \")\n    print(f\"Static variable: {static_var}\")\n    try:\n        print(f\"Automatic variable: {auto_var}\")\n    except NameError:\n        print(\"Automatic variable is not accessible here.\")\n\n# Dynamic variable\ndynamic_var = None\n\ndef main():\n    global dynamic_var\n    dynamic_var = 30\n    outer_function()\n    print(\"In main function: \")\n    print(f\"Dynamic variable: {dynamic_var}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Static Variable:** The `static_var` variable is defined inside the `outer_function`. It is static because it retains its value between function calls.\n2.  **Automatic Variable:** The `auto_var` variable is defined inside the `inner_function`. It is automatic because it is created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns. It is not accessible outside the `inner_function`.\n3.  **Dynamic Variable:** The `dynamic_var` variable is defined globally. Its lifetime is dynamic because it can be created and destroyed at runtime using memory allocation and deallocation functions.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nInside inner_function: \nStatic variable: 10\nAutomatic variable: 20\nInside outer_function: \nStatic variable: 10\nAutomatic variable is not accessible here.\nIn main function: \nDynamic variable: 30\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how variables with different lifetimes can be used in a program. The `static_var` retains its value between function calls, while the `auto_var` is created and destroyed with each function call. The `dynamic_var` can be accessed and modified globally.",
