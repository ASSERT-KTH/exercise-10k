  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two player's choices (rock, paper, scissors) as input and determines the winner based on the following criteria: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the winner of a rock-paper-scissors game.\n\n    Args:\n        player1_choice (str): The choice of player 1. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n        player2_choice (str): The choice of player 2. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The winner of the game. Can be 'player1', 'player2', or 'tie'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both players have made the same choice\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n\n    # Check if player 1 wins\n    if (player1_choice == 'rock' and player2_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (player1_choice == 'paper' and player2_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (player1_choice == 'scissors' and player2_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'player1'\n\n    # If player 1 does not win and it's not a tie, then player 2 must win\n    return 'player2'\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the choices of the two players\n    player1_choice = input(\"Enter player 1's choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n    player2_choice = input(\"Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n\n    # Validate the input\n    valid_choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    while player1_choice not in valid_choices or player2_choice not in valid_choices:\n        print(\"Invalid choice.

The `main` function gets the choices of the two players, validates the input, determines the winner, and prints the result. The program uses if/else statements to determine the winner.",
