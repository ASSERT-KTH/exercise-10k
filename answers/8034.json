  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses an if/else statement to perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for numbers and operation\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    \n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter the operation number (1/2/3/4): \")\n    \n    # Use if/else statement to perform the chosen operation\n    if choice == '1':\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 != 0:\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operation choice.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation.\n2. **Operation Choice**: The user is presented with a menu to choose the operation they want to perform.\n3. **Perform Operation**: Based on the user's choice, the program uses an if/else statement to perform the chosen operation.\n4. **Division Check**: For division, the program checks if the second number is zero to prevent division by zero errors.\n5. **Result Display**: The program then displays the result of the operation.\n6. **Error Handling**: If the user chooses an invalid operation, the program displays an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n- Addition: Enter `1` as the operation choice to add two numbers.\n- Subtraction: Enter `2` as the operation choice to subtract the second number from the first.\n- Multiplication: Enter `3` as the operation choice to multiply two numbers.\n- Division: Enter `4` as the operation choice to divide the first number by the second.",
