  "answer": "**Common Elements in Two Arrays**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the common elements in two arrays. It uses Python as the programming language and utilizes the built-in `set` data structure for efficient lookup.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(array1, array2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the common elements in two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        array1 (list): The first array.\n        array2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the arrays to sets for efficient lookup\n    set1 = set(array1)\n    set2 = set(array2)\n\n    # Find the intersection of the two sets\n    common = set1 & set2\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list and return it\n    return list(common)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    common = common_elements(array1, array2)\n    print(\"Common elements:\", common)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `common_elements` function takes two arrays as input and converts them to sets.\n2. It finds the intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator.\n3. The result is converted back to a list and returned.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `common_elements` with two example arrays.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nCommon elements: [4, 5]\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because we use sets for efficient lookup, which allows us to find the common elements in linear time.",
