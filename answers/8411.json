  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student has passed or failed. The passing grade is 60. If the student's grade is 90 or above, output 'A', between 80 and 89, output 'B', between 70 and 79, output 'C', between 60 and 69, output 'D', and below 60, output 'F'. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get the user input\ngrade = int(input(\"Enter your grade: \"))\n\n# Check if the grade is passing\nif grade >= 60:\n    print(\"You passed!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You failed!\")\n\n# Determine the letter grade\nif grade >= 90:\n    print(\"A\")\nelif grade >= 80:\n    print(\"B\")\nelif grade >= 70:\n    print(\"C\")\nelif grade >= 60:\n    print(\"D\")\nelse:\n    print(\"F\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact structure and logic described in the specifications. It first checks if the grade is passing, then determines the letter grade based on the grade value.",
