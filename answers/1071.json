  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n\n    # Print the first n Fibonacci numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        print(a, end=' ')\n        # Update a and b for the next iteration\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Test the function\nn = 10  # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\nprint_fibonacci(n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We define a function `print_fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n*   Inside the function, we initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively.\n*   We use a for loop to iterate `n` times. In each iteration, we print the current value of `a`.\n*   After printing `a`, we update its value to `b` and update `b` to the sum of the previous `a` and `b`. This effectively calculates the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n*   Finally, we test the function by calling it with `n = 10` to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to use a for loop to generate and print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.",
