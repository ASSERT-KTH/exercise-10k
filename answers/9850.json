  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string input and returns the string reversed, with the additional complexity of also reversing the order of characters within each word, while maintaining the original word order. For example, the string 'hello world' should be transformed into 'olleh dlrow'. The input string will only contain spaces as delimiters and lowercase English letters.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that reverses the order of characters within each word in a given string while maintaining the original word order. This function will take a string input, reverse each word, and return the resulting string. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string input and returns the string with each word's characters reversed, \n    while maintaining the original word order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string to be processed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The processed string with each word's characters reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we split the input string into a list of words using space as the delimiter\n    words = input_str.split(' ')\n\n    # Then, we use a list comprehension to reverse each word in the list\n    # The expression word[::-1] is using slicing to create a reversed copy of the word\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n\n    # Finally, we join the reversed words back into a string using space as the delimiter\n    reversed_str = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n\n    # We return the resulting string\n    return reversed_str\n\n# Test the function\nprint(reverse_string('hello world'))  # Output: 'olleh dlrow'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `reverse_string` starts by splitting the input string `input_str` into a list of words using the `split` method with a space as the delimiter, and stores the result in the `words` variable.\n* It then uses a list comprehension to reverse each word in the `words` list. The expression `word[::-1]` uses slicing to create a reversed copy of each word, and the results are stored in the `reversed_words` list.\n* Finally, the function joins the reversed words back into a string using the `join` method with a space as the delimiter, and returns the resulting string as `reversed_str`.\n* The test case `print(reverse_string('hello world'))` demonstrates the function's behavior, correctly outputting `'olleh dlrow'`.",
