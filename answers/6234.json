  "answer": "**Consecutive Numbers Checker Function**\n======================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef has_consecutive_numbers(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the list contains consecutive numbers, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    num_list.sort()\n\n    # Check for consecutive numbers\n    for i in range(len(num_list) - 1):\n        if num_list[i + 1] - num_list[i] != 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test case 1: List with consecutive numbers\n    print(has_consecutive_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: True\n\n    # Test case 2: List without consecutive numbers\n    print(has_consecutive_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]))  # Expected output: False\n\n    # Test case 3: List with duplicate numbers\n    print(has_consecutive_numbers([1, 2, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `has_consecutive_numbers` takes a list of integers `num_list` as input.\n2.  It first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort` method.\n3.  Then, it iterates through the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is equal to 1.\n4.  If it finds a pair of numbers that are not consecutive, it immediately returns `False`.\n5.  If it completes the iteration without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The subsequent iteration has a time complexity of O(n), but it is dominated by the sorting step.",
