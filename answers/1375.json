  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The LCM of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of `a` and `b`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`\n    gcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = (a * b) // gcd\n\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their LCM.\n2. The function uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.\n3. The LCM is then calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a \\* b) / GCD(a, b).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_lcm` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the LCM of 12 and 15: `calculate_lcm(12, 15)` returns `60`.\n* Calculate the LCM of 24 and 30: `calculate_lcm(24, 30)` returns `120`.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use the following alternative implementation for the GCD calculation:\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```",
