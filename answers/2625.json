  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a starting number and the number of terms as input and generates a sequence of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates a sequence of numbers based on the starting number and the number of terms:\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(start, terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a sequence of numbers starting from 'start' with 'terms' number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.\n        terms (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [start + i for i in range(terms)]\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the starting number and the number of terms from the user\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the starting number: \"))\n    terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    # Generate the sequence\n    sequence = generate_sequence(start, terms)\n\n    # Print the sequence\n    print(\"The sequence is:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_sequence` function takes two arguments: `start` and `terms`.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to generate the sequence of numbers.\n*   The `main` function gets the starting number and the number of terms from the user, generates the sequence, and prints it.\n*   The sequence is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the starting number and the number of terms. For example, if you enter `1` as the starting number and `5` as the number of terms, the program will output:\n\n```\nEnter the starting number: 1\nEnter the number of terms: 5\nThe sequence is:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```",
