  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array and a target value as input, then returns the indices of all occurrences of the target value in the array. If the target value is not found, return an empty list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds all occurrences of a target value in an array and returns their indices. This function will help you locate specific elements within a list. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_indices(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array and a target value as input, \n    then returns the indices of all occurrences of the target value in the array.\n    \n    If the target value is not found, return an empty list.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array (list): The input list to search for the target value.\n    target: The value to search for in the array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of indices where the target value is found in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the indices of the target value\n    indices = []\n\n    # Iterate over the array with the enumerate function to get both the index and value\n    for i, value in enumerate(array):\n        \n        # Check if the current value is equal to the target value\n        if value == target:\n            \n            # If it is, append the index to the indices list\n            indices.append(i)\n\n    # Return the list of indices\n    return indices\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget = 2\nprint(find_indices(array, target))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `find_indices` takes two parameters: `array` and `target`. It iterates over the `array` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `value` of each element.\n*   Inside the loop, it checks if the current `value` is equal to the `target`. If they match, the index `i` is appended to the `indices` list.\n*   After checking all elements, the function returns the `indices` list, which contains the indices of all occurrences of the `target` value in the `array`. If the `target` value is not found, an empty list is returned.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `find_indices` function with a sample `array` and `target` value, and it prints the resulting list of indices.",
