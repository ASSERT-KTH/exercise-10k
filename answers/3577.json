  "answer": "### Dictionary Intersection Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following function finds the intersection between two dictionaries. The intersection is defined as the set of key-value pairs that are common to both dictionaries.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the key-value pairs common to both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    intersection = {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key in dict2 and dict1[key] == dict2[key]}\n    return intersection\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n    dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n    print(dict_intersection(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs in `dict1`.\n*   For each key-value pair, it checks if the key exists in `dict2` and if the values are equal.\n*   If both conditions are met, the key-value pair is added to the `intersection` dictionary.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `intersection` dictionary.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs in the first dictionary, making it efficient for large dictionaries.",
