  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to scramble\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scrambles a word by shuffling its characters.\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays the word scramble game.\"\"\"\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    if user_answer.lower() == word:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to start the game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!\")\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a scrambled word and ask you to unscramble it.\n3. Enter your answer.\n4. The program will tell you if your answer is correct or not.\n5. You will be asked if you want to play again.\n6. If you answer \"y\", the game will start again with a new scrambled word.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list, and then joins the characters back into a string.\n2. The `play_game` function chooses a random word from the list, scrambles it, and asks the user to unscramble it.\n3. The `main` function starts the game and asks the user if they want to play again after each round.",
