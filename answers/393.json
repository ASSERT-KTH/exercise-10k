  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism given its length, width, and height.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_volume(length, width, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangular prism.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangular prism.\n        height (float): The height of the rectangular prism.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the rectangular prism.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = length * width * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dimensions from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the rectangular prism: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = calculate_volume(length, width, height)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The volume of the rectangular prism is: {volume} cubic units\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_volume` that takes the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism as arguments and returns its volume. The `main` function gets the dimensions from the user, calculates the volume, and prints the result.\n\n**How to run the program:**\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rectangular_prism_volume.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python rectangular_prism_volume.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism.\n5. The program will print the volume of the rectangular prism.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\nIf you enter the following dimensions:\n\n* Length: 5\n* Width: 3\n* Height: 2\n\nThe program will print:\n\n`The volume of the rectangular prism is: 30.0 cubic units`",
