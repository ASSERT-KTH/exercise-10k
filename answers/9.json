  "answer": "**User Input Decision Maker**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses conditional statements to make decisions based on user input. It will ask the user for their age and then provide recommendations based on that age.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    # Check if the user is eligible to vote\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n    # Check if the user is eligible to drink\n    if age >= 21:\n        print(\"You are eligible to drink.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to drink.\")\n\n    # Check if the user is eligible for senior discounts\n    if age >= 65:\n        print(\"You are eligible for senior discounts.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible for senior discounts.\")\n\n    # Check if the user is a minor\n    if age < 18:\n        print(\"You are a minor.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* If the user enters an age of 25, the program will output:\n  * \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n  * \"You are eligible to drink.\"\n  * \"You are not eligible for senior discounts.\"\n  * \"You are an adult.\"\n* If the user enters an age of 17, the program will output:\n  * \"You are not eligible to vote.\"\n  * \"You are not eligible to drink.\"\n  * \"You are not eligible for senior discounts.\"\n  * \"You are a minor.\"\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program first imports the necessary modules (in this case, none).\n2. The `main` function is defined to contain the program's logic.\n3. The user is prompted to enter their age using the `input` function.\n4. The program uses conditional statements (if-else statements) to check the user's age and provide recommendations based on that age.\n5. The program outputs the recommendations to the user.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Always validate user input to ensure it is in the expected format.\n* Use conditional statements to make decisions based on user input.\n* Use clear and concise language when outputting recommendations to the user.\n* Consider using a more robust input validation system, such as using a `try-except` block to catch any invalid input.",
