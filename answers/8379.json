The default value for `n` is 50.\n*   Inside the function, we initialize the sum `exp` to 0.0 and then use a loop to calculate each term in the Taylor series expansion.\n*   For each term, we calculate the factorial and then add the term to the sum `exp`.\n*   Finally, we return the calculated exponential value.\n*   In the `main` function, we test the `exponential` function with a sample input `x = 2.0` and print the result.",
