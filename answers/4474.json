  "prompt": "Write a program to count the number of elements in a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a for loop",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to count the number of elements in a list that meet a specific condition:\n\n```python\ndef count_elements(lst, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of elements in a list that are greater than a given threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of numbers to check.\n        threshold (int): The threshold value.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of elements greater than the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num > threshold:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nthreshold = 3\nresult = count_elements(numbers, threshold)\nprint(f\"Numbers greater than {threshold}: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `count_elements` that takes a list `lst` and a threshold value `threshold` as arguments. We initialize a counter variable `count` to 0. Then, we iterate over each number `num` in the list using a for loop. If the number is greater than the threshold, we increment the counter by 1. Finally, we return the count.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a list of numbers from 1 to 9 and set the threshold to 3. We call the `count_elements` function with these values and print the result. The output should be `Numbers greater than 3: 6`, because there are 6 numbers greater than 3 in the list (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).",
