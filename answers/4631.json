  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array as input, and returns the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses the NumPy library to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistics(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the input to a NumPy array\n    array = np.array(array)\n\n    # Calculate the mean of the array\n    mean = np.mean(array)\n\n    # Calculate the median of the array\n    median = np.median(array)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the array\n    std_dev = np.std(array)\n\n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(array)\n\n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n    print(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We import the `numpy` library to use its built-in functions for calculating statistical measures.\n*   We define a function `calculate_statistics` that takes an array as input, calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation using NumPy functions, and returns these values.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_statistics` function with an example array and print the results.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This program assumes that the input array contains only numbers. If the array might contain non-numeric values, you should add error checking code to handle this.\n*   The `np.std` function calculates the population standard deviation by default. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation instead, you can pass the argument `ddof=1` to the `np.std` function.",
