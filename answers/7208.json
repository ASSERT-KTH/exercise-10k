  "answer": "**Student Average Grade Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student using a for loop. It prompts the user to enter the number of grades and then the grades themselves, and finally displays the average grade.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade():\n    # Get the number of grades from the user\n    num_grades = int(input(\"Enter the number of grades: \"))\n\n    # Initialize the sum of grades to 0\n    total_grades = 0\n\n    # Loop through each grade\n    for i in range(num_grades):\n        # Get the grade from the user\n        grade = float(input(f\"Enter grade {i+1}: \"))\n\n        # Add the grade to the total\n        total_grades += grade\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = total_grades / num_grades\n\n    # Display the average grade\n    print(f\"The average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_average_grade()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of grades when prompted (e.g., 3).\n3. Enter each grade when prompted (e.g., 85, 90, 78).\n4. The program will display the average grade (e.g., 84.33).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a for loop to iterate through each grade.\n* The `input` function is used to get user input, and the `float` function is used to convert the input to a floating-point number.\n* The average grade is calculated by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to display the average grade with two decimal places.",
