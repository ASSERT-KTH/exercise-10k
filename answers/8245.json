  "answer": "**Time-Based Greeting Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses Python to greet the user based on the current time of day. It utilizes the `datetime` module to get the current hour and then uses if/else statements to determine the appropriate greeting.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef get_greeting():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a greeting based on the current time of day.\n    \"\"\"\n    now = datetime.now()\n    current_hour = now.hour\n\n    if current_hour < 12:\n        return \"Good morning!\"\n    elif current_hour < 18:\n        return \"Good afternoon!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Good evening!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(get_greeting())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_greeting` function retrieves the current date and time using `datetime.now()`.\n2. It extracts the current hour from the datetime object using `now.hour`.\n3. The function uses if/else statements to determine the greeting based on the current hour:\n   * If the current hour is less than 12 (00:00 - 11:59), it returns \"Good morning!\".\n   * If the current hour is between 12 and 17 (12:00 - 17:59), it returns \"Good afternoon!\".\n   * If the current hour is 18 or greater (18:00 - 23:59), it returns \"Good evening!\".\n4. The `main` function calls `get_greeting` and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Running the program at 08:00 would output \"Good morning!\".\n* Running the program at 14:00 would output \"Good afternoon!\".\n* Running the program at 20:00 would output \"Good evening!\".",
