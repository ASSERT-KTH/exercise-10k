  "answer": "### Variable Scope in Python\nIn Python, variables can be declared inside and outside a function. The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed.\n\n#### Code Example\n```python\n# Declare a variable outside a function (global scope)\nglobal_variable = \"I'm global\"\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Declare a variable inside a function (local scope)\n    local_variable = \"I'm local\"\n    \n    # Try to access the global variable from inside the function\n    print(\"Inside function: global_variable =\", global_variable)\n    \n    # Try to access the local variable from inside the function\n    print(\"Inside function: local_variable =\", local_variable)\n\n# Try to access the global variable from outside the function\nprint(\"Outside function: global_variable =\", global_variable)\n\n# Try to access the local variable from outside the function\ntry:\n    print(\"Outside function: local_variable =\", local_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Outside function: local_variable is not defined\")\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   We declare a `global_variable` outside the `my_function` with the value \"I'm global\". This variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.\n*   Inside `my_function`, we declare a `local_variable` with the value \"I'm local\". This variable is only accessible within the function.\n*   When we run `my_function()`, it prints the values of both `global_variable` and `local_variable`.\n*   From outside the function, we can access `global_variable` but not `local_variable`, which raises a `NameError`.\n\n#### Output\n```\nOutside function: global_variable = I'm global\nOutside function: local_variable is not defined\nInside function: global_variable = I'm global\nInside function: local_variable = I'm local\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the concept of variable scope in Python, where variables declared inside a function are local to that function and not accessible from outside, while variables declared outside a function are global and can be accessed from anywhere.",
