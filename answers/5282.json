  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is a user-inputted value. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Creation Date: [Today's Date]\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    sum += i ** 2\n    print(i ** 2)\n\nprint(\"The final answer is: \", sum)\n```\nNote that I've left the author and creation date comments blank, as they would typically contain your own information. You can fill them in as needed. The rest of the code follows the specifications exactly.",
