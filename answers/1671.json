  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes the day of the month and the month as input and determines the day of the week (Monday to Sunday) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to determine the day of the week. The program takes the day of the month and the month as input and outputs the day of the week.\n\n```python\ndef find_day_of_week(day, month, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the day of the week using Zeller's Congruence algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        day (int): Day of the month (1-31)\n        month (int): Month of the year (1-12)\n        year (int): Year\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The day of the week (Monday to Sunday)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Adjust month and year for January and February\n    if month < 3:\n        month += 12\n        year -= 1\n\n    # Calculate the day of the week\n    q = day\n    m = month\n    k = year % 100\n    j = year // 100\n\n    f = q + ((13 * (m + 1)) // 5) + k + (k // 4) + (j // 4) - (2 * j)\n    result = f % 7\n\n    # Map the result to the corresponding day of the week\n    if result == 0:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n    elif result == 1:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    elif result == 2:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif result == 3:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif result == 4:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif result == 5:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    else:\n        return \"Friday\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day of the month (1-31): \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n\n    day_of_week = find_day_of_week(day, month, year)\n\n    print(f\"The day of the week is: {day_of_week}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n1. Input: Day = 16, Month = 9, Year = 2024\n   Output: The day of the week is: Monday\n\n2. Input: Day = 25, Month = 12, Year = 2023\n   Output: The day of the week is: Monday\n\n**Note:** This program uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm, which is a mathematical formula devised to calculate the day of the week for any date in the Gregorian and Julian calendars. The algorithm takes into account the month and year adjustments for January and February. The result is then mapped to the corresponding day of the week using if/else statements.",
