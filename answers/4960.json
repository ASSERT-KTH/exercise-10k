  "prompt": "Create a program that determines the outcome of a simple game based on user input (win, lose, or draw) using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that determines the outcome of a simple game based on user input using conditional statements:\n\n```python\n# Function to determine the outcome of the game\ndef determine_game_outcome(outcome):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the outcome of the game based on user input.\n\n    Args:\n        outcome (str): The outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating the outcome of the game.\n    \"\"\"\n    if outcome.lower() == \"win\":\n        return \"Congratulations, you won the game!\"\n    elif outcome.lower() == \"lose\":\n        return \"Better luck next time, you lost the game.\"\n    elif outcome.lower() == \"draw\":\n        return \"It's a draw! The game ended in a tie.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid outcome. Please enter win, lose, or draw.\"\n\n# Main function to get user input and determine the game outcome\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Game Outcome Determiner\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    outcome = input(\"Enter the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw): \")\n    result = determine_game_outcome(outcome)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\nTo run the program, follow these steps:\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `game_outcome.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python game_outcome.py` to run the program.\n4. Enter the outcome of the game when prompted (win, lose, or draw).\n5. The program will display a message indicating the outcome of the game.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters \"win\", the program will display \"Congratulations, you won the game!\".\n* If the user enters \"lose\", the program will display \"Better luck next time, you lost the game.\".\n* If the user enters \"draw\", the program will display \"It's a draw! The game ended in a tie.\".\n* If the user enters anything other than \"win\", \"lose\", or \"draw\", the program will display \"Invalid outcome. Please enter win, lose, or draw.\".",
