  "answer": "**Hangman Game Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program implements a simple hangman game using a while loop. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's gallows is drawn. The game continues until the player guesses the word or the gallows is complete and the player is hanged.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to guess from\nword_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word)\n\n    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores\n    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length\n    guessed_letters = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(display_hangman(tries))\n    print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n\n    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) != 1:\n            print(\"Please guess one letter at a time.\")\n        elif guess in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You already guessed this letter.\")\n        elif guess not in word:\n            print(f\"Incorrect! {guess} is not in the word.\")\n            tries -= 1\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Good job! {guess} is in the word.\")\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            word_as_list = list(word)\n            indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n            for index in indices:\n                guessed_word[index] = guess\n\n        print(display_hangman(tries))\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n\n    if '_' not in guessed_word:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you didn't guess the word.

Run the program.\n2. The program will display a hangman figure and a series of underscores representing the word to guess.\n3. Guess a letter by typing it in.\n4. If the letter is in the word, the program will fill in the corresponding underscores.\n5. If the letter is not in the word, the program will draw a part of the hangman's gallows.\n6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or the gallows is complete and you are hanged.",
