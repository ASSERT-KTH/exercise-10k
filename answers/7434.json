  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef sub(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n    else:\n        return x / y\n\nprint(add(15, 32))\nprint(sub(50, 35))\nprint(multiply(45, 3))\nprint(divide(10, 2))\nprint(divide(55, 0))\n```\nThis code defines the four functions as specified: `add`, `sub`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two arguments, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, and returns the result. The `divide` function also includes a check to prevent division by zero and returns an error message instead. The code then calls each function with sample input values and prints the results.",
