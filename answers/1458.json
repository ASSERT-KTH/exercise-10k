  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time of an object.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(speed, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance traveled given the speed and time.\n\n    Args:\n        speed (float): The speed of the object in meters per second.\n        time (float): The time traveled in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance traveled in meters.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = speed * time\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed (m/s): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time (s): \"))\n\n    # Calculate distance\n    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The distance traveled is {distance} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the speed (e.g., 5 m/s) when prompted.\n3. Enter the time (e.g., 10 s) when prompted.\n4. The program will output the calculated distance (e.g., 50 meters).\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula used to calculate the distance traveled is:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nThis program assumes that the speed and time are constant over the given time period. In real-world scenarios, you may need to account for acceleration, deceleration, or other factors that affect the distance traveled.",
