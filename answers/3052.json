  "answer": "**Mapping Numbers to Squares Function**\n======================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is mapped to its square.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef map_to_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Maps a list of numbers to their squares.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list where each number is mapped to its square.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num ** 2 for num in numbers]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    squares = map_to_squares(numbers)\n    print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `map_to_squares` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list.\n*   For each number `num`, it calculates the square using the exponentiation operator `** 2` and adds the result to the new list.\n*   The function returns the new list of squares.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `map_to_squares` by passing a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and printing the resulting list of squares.",
