  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary containing student information, including names, grades, and test scores. The program should calculate the average test score for each grade level and store the results in a new dictionary. The program should then print out the dictionary with the average test scores.",

The function iterates over each student, updating the sum of test scores and the count of students for each grade level. It then calculates the average test score for each grade level by dividing the sum of test scores by the count of students.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates example usage of `calculate_average_test_scores` with a sample dictionary of student information. It prints the average test scores for each grade level.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of students in the input dictionary. This is because the solution iterates over each student once to calculate the sum of test scores and the count of students for each grade level, and then iterates over each grade level once to calculate the average test score.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(m), where m is the number of unique grade levels in the input dictionary. This is because the solution uses a dictionary to store the sum of test scores and the count of students for each grade level, and then uses another dictionary to store the average test scores for each grade level.",
