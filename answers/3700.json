  "answer": "**Average Speed Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the average speed given the total distance traveled and the time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average speed given the total distance and time taken.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Total distance traveled in kilometers.\n        time (float): Time taken in hours.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Average speed in kilometers per hour.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time must be greater than zero.\")\n    average_speed = distance / time\n    return average_speed\n\n\ndef main():\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the total distance traveled (in kilometers): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken (in hours): \"))\n\n    try:\n        average_speed = calculate_average_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The average speed is {average_speed:.2f} km/h.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average_speed` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `time`.\n2. It checks if the time is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. The average speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the distance and time.\n5. It calls the `calculate_average_speed` function and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program.\n* Enter the total distance traveled (e.g., 250 kilometers).\n* Enter the time taken (e.g., 5 hours).\n* The program will output the average speed (e.g., 50.00 km/h).",
