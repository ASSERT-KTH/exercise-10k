  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to ask questions and keep track of score\ndef quiz():\n    score = 0\n    total_questions = 5\n\n    # Question 1\n    print(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n    print(\"A) Berlin\")\n    print(\"B) Paris\")\n    print(\"C) London\")\n    print(\"D) Rome\")\n    answer1 = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n    if answer1.upper() == \"B\":\n        print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Paris\\n\")\n\n    # Question 2\n    print(\"Which planet is the largest in our solar system?\")\n    print(\"A) Earth\")\n    print(\"B) Saturn\")\n    print(\"C) Jupiter\")\n    print(\"D) Uranus\")\n    answer2 = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n    if answer2.upper() == \"C\":\n        print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is C) Jupiter\\n\")\n\n    # Question 3\n    print(\"Who wrote the famous novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\")\n    print(\"A) F. Scott Fitzgerald\")\n    print(\"B) Harper Lee\")\n    print(\"C) Jane Austen\")\n    print(\"D) J.K. Rowling\")\n    answer3 = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n    if answer3.upper() == \"B\":\n        print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Harper Lee\\n\")\n\n    # Question 4\n    print(\"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\")\n    print(\"A) Ag\")\n    print(\"B) Au\")\n    print(\"C) Hg\")\n    print(\"D) Pb\")\n    answer4 = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n    if answer4.upper() == \"B\":\n        print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Au\\n\")\n\n    # Question 5\n    print(\"Who painted the famous artwork 'The Starry Night'?\")\n    print(\"A) Leonardo da Vinci\")\n    print(\"B) Vincent van Gogh\")\n    print(\"C) Claude Monet\")\n    print(\"D) Pablo Picasso\")\n    answer5 = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n    if answer5.upper() == \"B\":\n        print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is B) Vincent van Gogh\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {total_questions}\")\n\n# Call the quiz function\nquiz()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\nTo run the program, simply copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter or save it to a file with a `.py` extension and run it using Python. The program will ask the user a series of questions, and after each question, it will print whether the answer was correct or not. At the end of the quiz, it will print the user's final score.\n\n**Note:**\nThis program uses `if/else` statements to determine the correct answer for each question. The `input()` function is used to get the user's answer, and the `upper()` method is used to convert the user's input to uppercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.",
