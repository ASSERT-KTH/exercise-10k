  "answer": "**Longest Palindrome Substring**\n================================\n\nThe goal is to find the longest substring in a given string that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a helper function to expand around the center of the palindrome:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest palindrome substring in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest palindrome substring.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Expand around the center of the palindrome.\n\n        Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n        left (int): The left index.\n        right (int): The right index.\n\n        Returns:\n        str: The longest palindrome substring.\n        \"\"\"\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return s[left + 1:right]\n\n    longest = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd length palindrome\n        odd_length_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n        if len(odd_length_palindrome) > len(longest):\n            longest = odd_length_palindrome\n\n        # Even length palindrome\n        even_length_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n        if len(even_length_palindrome) > len(longest):\n            longest = even_length_palindrome\n\n    return longest\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_palindrome(\"babad\"))  # \"bab\"\nprint(longest_palindrome(\"cbbd\"))   # \"bb\"\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1.  Define a helper function `expand_around_center` that takes the input string `s` and two indices `left` and `right` as arguments.\n2.  The helper function expands around the center of the palindrome by comparing characters at the `left` and `right` indices and moving the indices outward as long as the characters match.\n3.  In the main function `longest_palindrome`, iterate through the input string `s` and treat each character as the center of a potential palindrome.\n4.  For each character, call the `expand_around_center` function twice: once for an odd-length palindrome (with `left` and `right` indices equal) and once for an even-length palindrome (with `left` and `right` indices differing by 1).\n5.  Keep track of the longest palindrome substring found so far and return it at the end.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, because in the worst case, we need to expand around the center of each character in the string.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), excluding the space needed for the output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the longest palindrome substring.",
