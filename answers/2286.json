You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the necessary module**: We import the `random` module, which we use to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n2. **Define a function**: We define a function called `guess_the_number`, which contains the game logic.\n3. **Think of a number**: Inside the function, we generate a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n4. **Initialize the number of tries**: We initialize a variable called `tries` to keep track of the number of attempts the user makes to guess the number.\n5. **Game loop**: The game loop runs indefinitely until the user guesses the number or types \"quit\".\n6. **Get the user's guess**: Inside the loop, we ask the user for their guess using `input(\"Enter your guess: \")`.\n7. **Check if the user wants to quit**: If the user types \"quit\", we reveal the number and break out of the loop.\n8. **Try to convert the user's guess to an integer**: We attempt to convert the user's guess to an integer using `int(user_guess)`. If this fails (for example, if the user enters a string), we print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n9. **Increment the number of tries**: We increment the `tries` variable each time the user makes a guess.\n10. **Check if the user's guess is correct**: If the user's guess matches the number, we congratulate the user and reveal the number of tries it took to guess correctly. If the guess is too low or too high, we print a hint and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and guess the number by entering a number between 1 and 100.\n* Type \"quit\" to give up and reveal the number.\n* Enter an invalid input (such as a string or a special character) to see an error message.",
