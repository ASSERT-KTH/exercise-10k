  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list, an index, and an element as input and inserts the element at the specified index.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\ndef insert_element(lst, index, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts an element at a specified index in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        index (int): The index where the element should be inserted.\n        element: The element to be inserted.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    lst.insert(index, element)\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 5]\nindex = 3\nelement = 4\n\nprint(\"Original list:\", lst)\ninsert_element(lst, index, element)\nprint(\"List after insertion:\", lst)\n```\nNote that I've used the `insert` method of the list to perform the insertion, as specified in the requirements. I've also included a docstring to provide a brief description of the function and its parameters. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the results.",
