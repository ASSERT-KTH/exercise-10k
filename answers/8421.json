Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the math operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation.

The `math_operation` function takes in two numbers and an operation as arguments.\n2. It checks if the operation is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n3. It then performs the operation using conditional statements and returns the result.\n4. If the operation is '/', it checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if necessary.\n5. The `main` function gets the two numbers and the operation from the user, calls `math_operation`, and prints the result.\n6. It also catches any `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError` that may be raised and prints an error message.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* Add two numbers: Enter `2` and `3` as the numbers and `+` as the operation. The output will be `2 + 3 = 5.0`.\n* Subtract two numbers: Enter `5` and `2` as the numbers and `-` as the operation. The output will be `5 - 2 = 3.0`.\n* Multiply two numbers: Enter `4` and `5` as the numbers and `*` as the operation. The output will be `4 * 5 = 20.0`.\n* Divide two numbers: Enter `10` and `2` as the numbers and `/` as the operation. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
