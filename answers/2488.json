  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings. It uses a simple iterative approach to compare the characters of each string at the same position.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    strings = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\n    print(\"Longest common prefix:\", longest_common_prefix(strings))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `longest_common_prefix` function takes a list of strings as input.\n2.  If the input list is empty, it returns an empty string.\n3.  It finds the shortest string in the list, as the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n4.  It iterates over the characters of the shortest string and checks if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings.\n5.  If it finds a mismatch, it returns the common prefix up to the mismatched character.\n6.  If it iterates over the entire shortest string without finding a mismatch, it returns the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Finding the longest common prefix among a list of file names or URLs.\n*   Identifying common prefixes in a list of strings, such as country codes or phone number prefixes.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the input list. This is because in the worst case, it needs to iterate over each character of the shortest string and compare it with the corresponding character in each of the other strings.",
