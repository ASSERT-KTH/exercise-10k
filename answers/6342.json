  "prompt": "Identify and explain the rules for naming variables in a programming language. Provide examples of valid and invalid variable names.",
  "answer": "In programming languages, variable names are used to identify and store values. The rules for naming variables vary slightly from language to language, but most follow these general guidelines:\n\n**General Rules:**\n\n1. **Variable names must start with a letter or underscore**: This is to distinguish variable names from numeric literals and other symbols.\n2. **Variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores**: After the first character, variable names can contain a combination of letters, digits, and underscores.\n3. **Variable names cannot contain special characters**: Most special characters, such as `@`, `$`, `#`, etc., are not allowed in variable names.\n4. **Variable names are case-sensitive**: This means that `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are considered two different variables.\n5. **Variable names cannot be reserved keywords**: Reserved keywords, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, etc., cannot be used as variable names.\n6. **Variable names must be unique**: Each variable name must be unique within its scope.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Valid Variable Names:**\n\n* `myVariable`\n* `helloWorld`\n* `x`\n* `_abc`\n* `fooBar123`\n\n**Invalid Variable Names:**\n\n* `123abc` (starts with a digit)\n* `@hello` (contains a special character)\n* `my-variable` (contains a hyphen)\n* `if` (is a reserved keyword)\n* `my variable` (contains a space)\n\n**Language-Specific Rules:**\n\nSome programming languages have additional rules or conventions for naming variables. For example:\n\n* In Python, variable names can contain Unicode characters, but it's generally recommended to stick with ASCII characters.\n* In Java, variable names must follow the camelCase convention (e.g., `myVariable`).\n* In C++, variable names can contain underscores, but it's generally recommended to avoid using them as the first character.\n\nIn summary, when naming variables, make sure to follow the general rules outlined above, and be aware of any language-specific conventions or restrictions.",
