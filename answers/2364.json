  "prompt": "Design a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their quotient and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Get two numbers from the user, calculate their quotient and remainder, and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, and returns their quotient and remainder.\n2. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calculates their quotient and remainder using the `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function, and prints the results.\n3. The program handles two potential errors:\n   - `ZeroDivisionError`: raised when the user tries to divide by zero.\n   - `ValueError`: raised when the user enters a non-integer value.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n* If the user enters `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output: `17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2`\n* If the user enters `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor, the program will output: `10 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0`\n* If the user enters `0` as the divisor, the program will output: `Cannot divide by zero`",
