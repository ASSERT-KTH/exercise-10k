  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a student's score as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale:\n- A: 90-100\n- B: 80-89\n- C: 70-79\n- D: 60-69\n- F: below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the given score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the student's score when prompted.\n3. The program will print the corresponding grade.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nEnter the student's score: 85\nThe student's grade is: B\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on the score.\n- The `calculate_grade` function returns the grade as a string.\n- The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, calculates the grade, and prints the result.\n- The program includes input validation to ensure the score is a number between 0 and 100.",
