  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a student's grade is passing or failing based on their score. If the score is 50 or above, the grade is passing; otherwise, it's failing.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student's grade is passing or failing based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: 'Passing' if the score is 50 or above, 'Failing' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 50:\n        return 'Passing'\n    else:\n        return 'Failing'\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = check_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns a string indicating whether the grade is 'Passing' or 'Failing'.\n*   The function uses a simple if-else statement to determine the grade based on the score.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a score, which is then passed to the `check_grade` function to determine the grade.\n*   The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can modify the `check_grade` function to accept additional parameters, such as the minimum passing score, to make the program more flexible.\n*   You can also add error handling to ensure that the input score is a valid number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a score of 60: The output will be 'Passing'.\n*   Enter a score of 40: The output will be 'Failing'.\n*   Enter a score of 50: The output will be 'Passing'.",
