  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the minimum of the two.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the minimum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a < b:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return b\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nmin_num = find_min(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The minimum of the two numbers is:\", min_num)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `find_min` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns the smallest of the two. The function uses a simple if-else statement to compare the two numbers and return the smaller one.\n\nIn the example usage, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers, calls the `find_min` function to find the minimum, and then prints the result.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the built-in `min` function in Python, which makes the code even simpler:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(a, b):\n    return min(a, b)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nmin_num = find_min(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The minimum of the two numbers is:\", min_num)\n```\n\nOr, you can make it even more concise:\n\n```python\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"The minimum of the two numbers is:\", min(num1, num2))\n```",
