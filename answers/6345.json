  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations Using Variables\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations using variables.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations():\n    # Define variables\n    num1 = 10\n    num2 = 2\n\n    # Addition\n    addition_result = num1 + num2\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n    # Subtraction\n    subtraction_result = num1 - num2\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n    # Multiplication\n    multiplication_result = num1 * num2\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n    # Division\n    if num2 != 0:\n        division_result = num1 / num2\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    perform_arithmetic_operations()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We define two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them values.\n2. **Perform Operations**: We perform the basic arithmetic operations using these variables:\n   - `addition_result = num1 + num2` for addition\n   - `subtraction_result = num1 - num2` for subtraction\n   - `multiplication_result = num1 * num2` for multiplication\n   - `division_result = num1 / num2` for division\n3. **Check for Division by Zero**: Before performing division, we check if `num2` is not equal to zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n4. **Print Results**: Finally, we print the results of each operation.\n\n#### Example Output\n\n```\nAddition: 10 + 2 = 12\nSubtraction: 10 - 2 = 8\nMultiplication: 10 * 2 = 20\nDivision: 10 / 2 = 5.0\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic example of how to use variables to perform arithmetic operations in Python. You can modify the values of `num1` and `num2` to test different scenarios.",
