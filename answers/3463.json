  "answer": "**Number Squaring Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a number, then prints out the square of that number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_number_from_user():\n    \"\"\"Get a number from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = float(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n            return num\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number. Try again.\")\n\ndef square_number(num):\n    \"\"\"Return the square of a number.\"\"\"\n    return num ** 2\n\ndef main():\n    num = get_number_from_user()\n    squared_num = square_number(num)\n    print(f\"The square of {num} is {squared_num}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a number when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n3. The program will print out the square of the number (e.g., `The square of 5.0 is 25.0.`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `get_number_from_user` function uses a `try`-`except` block to handle cases where the user enters something that can't be converted to a number.\n* The `square_number` function uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the square of a number.\n* The `main` function ties everything together, getting a number from the user, squaring it, and printing out the result.",
