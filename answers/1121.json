  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef greet_user(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message for the given user.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n    greet_user(name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `greet_user` function takes a `name` as input and prints out a greeting message using an f-string.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user for their name using the built-in `input` function.\n3. It then calls the `greet_user` function with the user's name as an argument.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will first ask you for your name. If you enter \"John\", it will then print out \"Hello, John!\".\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `greeting.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python greeting.py`).",
