  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are dictionaries containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and then find the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, your program should return all of them.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef students_average_grade(students):\n    # Initialize variables\n    students_avg = {}\n    students_avg_list = []\n\n    # Calculate average grades\n    for student, grades in students.items():\n        avg = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n        students_avg[student] = avg\n        students_avg_list.append(avg)\n\n    # Find the highest average grade\n    max_avg = max(students_avg_list)\n\n    # Find students with the highest average grade\n    students_max_avg = []\n    for student, avg in students_avg.items():\n        if avg == max_avg:\n            students_max_avg.append(student)\n\n    return students_max_avg\n\n# Example usage\nstudents = {\n    'John': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},\n    'Alice': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 95, 'English': 90},\n    'Charlie': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},\n    'David': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85}\n}\n\nresult = students_average_grade(students)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly, using the same variable names and data structures. It calculates the average grades for each student, finds the maximum average grade, and then finds the students with the maximum average grade. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample input dictionary `students`.",
