  "prompt": "Write a program that creates a bank account manager using if/else statement",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a bank account manager using Python:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder, balance):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_holder = account_holder\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposit successful. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please try again.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawal successful. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds. Please try again.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Your current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    account_number = input(\"Enter your account number: \")\n    account_holder = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n    balance = float(input(\"Enter your initial balance: \"))\n\n    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_holder, balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Manager\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **BankAccount Class**: We define a `BankAccount` class with attributes like `account_number`, `account_holder`, and `balance`.\n2. **Deposit Method**: The `deposit` method checks if the deposit amount is greater than 0. If true, it adds the amount to the balance and prints the new balance.\n3. **Withdraw Method**: The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the balance. If true, it subtracts the amount from the balance and prints the new balance.\n4. **Check Balance Method**: The `check_balance` method simply prints the current balance.\n5. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we create a new `BankAccount` object and provide a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with their account.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Deposit money into the account\n* Withdraw money from the account\n* Check the current balance\n* Exit the program\n\n### Advice:\n\n* Always validate user input to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.\n* Use `if-else` statements to handle different scenarios and provide informative error messages.\n* Consider using a more secure way to store sensitive information like account numbers and balances.",
