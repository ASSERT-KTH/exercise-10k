  "answer": "**Population Growth Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the future population of a city based on its current population, growth rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_future_population(current_population, growth_rate, time_period):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the future population of a city.\n\n    Args:\n        current_population (int): The current population of the city.\n        growth_rate (float): The growth rate of the city as a decimal.\n        time_period (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The future population of the city.\n    \"\"\"\n    future_population = current_population * (1 + growth_rate) ** time_period\n    return round(future_population)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Population Growth Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    current_population = int(input(\"Enter the current population: \"))\n    growth_rate = float(input(\"Enter the growth rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate future population\n    future_population = calculate_future_population(current_population, growth_rate, time_period)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The future population in {time_period} years will be approximately {future_population} people.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_future_population` function takes in the current population, growth rate, and time period as arguments.\n2. It calculates the future population using the formula `P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t`, where `P0` is the current population, `r` is the growth rate, and `t` is the time period.\n3. The `main` function gets user input for the current population, growth rate, and time period.\n4. It calls the `calculate_future_population` function to calculate the future population.\n5. Finally, it prints the result to the user.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the current population of a city (e.g., 100000).\n3. Enter the growth rate of the city (e.g., 2%).\n4. Enter the time period (e.g., 10 years).\n5. The program will calculate and print the future population of the city in 10 years.\n\nNote: This program assumes a constant growth rate over the time period, which may not be accurate in real-world scenarios.",
