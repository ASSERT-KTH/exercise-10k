  "answer": "**Cube Volume Function**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef cube_volume(side_length: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube.\n\n    Args:\n    side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    return side_length ** 3\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    side_length = 5.0\n    volume = cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `cube_volume` takes one argument, `side_length`, which is the length of a side of the cube.\n* It checks if the `side_length` is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError`.\n* The volume of the cube is calculated by cubing the `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n* The result is returned as a floating-point number.\n* In the example usage, we calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5.0 and print the result.",
