The program defines an `Employee` class with attributes `name`, `age`, and `salary`.\n2. The `print_details` method prints the employee's details in a formatted manner.\n3. The `main` function reads the employee's details from the user, creates an `Employee` object, and prints their details using the `print_details` method.",
