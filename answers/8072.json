  "answer": "**Higher-Order Function Example**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that returns another function. This is known as a higher-order function.\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(greeting):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a function that prints a personalized greeting.\n\n    Args:\n        greeting (str): The greeting to be used.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that takes a name and prints a personalized greeting.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function(name):\n        print(f\"{greeting}, {name}!\")\n\n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\nhello = outer_function(\"Hello\")\nhi = outer_function(\"Hi\")\n\nhello(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\nhi(\"Bob\")       # Output: Hi, Bob!\n```\n\nIn this example, `outer_function` takes a greeting as an argument and returns `inner_function`, which takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting using the provided greeting.\n\n**Use Cases**\n-------------\n\nHigher-order functions like this can be useful in a variety of situations, such as:\n\n* Creating functions with customized behavior\n* Implementing the factory pattern\n* Creating closures\n\n**How It Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `outer_function` is called with a greeting.\n2. The `outer_function` returns the `inner_function`, which has access to the greeting provided to `outer_function`.\n3. The returned `inner_function` can be called with a name to print a personalized greeting.\n\nNote that the `inner_function` has access to the scope of `outer_function`, allowing it to use the greeting provided to `outer_function` even after `outer_function` has returned. This is an example of a closure.",
