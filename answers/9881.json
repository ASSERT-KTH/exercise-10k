  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass FinanceTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.income = 0\n        self.expenses = {}\n\n    def get_income(self):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                self.income = float(input(\"Enter your monthly income: $\"))\n                if self.income < 0:\n                    print(\"Income cannot be negative.

Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    def calculate_summary(self):\n        total_expenses = sum(self.expenses.values())\n        remaining_balance = self.income - total_expenses\n        return total_expenses, remaining_balance\n\n    def print_summary(self):\n        total_expenses, remaining_balance = self.calculate_summary()\n        print(\"\\nSummary of Finances:\")\n        print(f\"Income: ${self.income:.2f}\")\n        print(\"Expenses:\")\n        for expense, amount in self.expenses.items():\n            print(f\"  - {expense}: ${amount:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Total Expenses: ${total_expenses:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Remaining Balance: ${remaining_balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    tracker = FinanceTracker()\n    tracker.get_income()\n    tracker.get_expenses()\n    tracker.print_summary()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `FinanceTracker` class is used to track a user's income and expenses.\n*   The `get_income` method prompts the user to enter their monthly income and validates the input to ensure it's a non-negative number.\n*   The `get_expenses` method allows the user to enter multiple expenses with their corresponding amounts. It continues to prompt the user for expenses until they enter 'done'.\n*   The `calculate_summary` method calculates the total expenses and the remaining balance by subtracting the total expenses from the income.\n*   The `print_summary` method prints a summary of the user's finances, including income, expenses, total expenses, and the remaining balance.\n*   The `main` function creates an instance of `FinanceTracker`, gets the user's income and expenses, and prints the summary.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your monthly income and expenses. After entering the expenses, type 'done' to finish. The program will then print a summary of your finances.\n\n```\nEnter your monthly income: $5000\nEnter the name of an expense (or 'done' to finish): Rent\nEnter the monthly amount for Rent: $1500\nEnter the name of an expense (or 'done' to finish): Utilities\nEnter the monthly amount for Utilities: $100\nEnter the name of an expense (or 'done' to finish): done\n\nSummary of Finances:\nIncome: $5000.00\nExpenses:\n  - Rent: $1500.00\n  - Utilities: $100.00\nTotal Expenses: $1600.00\nRemaining Balance: $3400.00\n```",
