  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote or not (assuming the voting age is 18).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\nprint(\"Hello\", name + \"!\")\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It prompts the user to enter their name using the `input()` function and stores the response in the `name` variable.\n2. It prompts the user to enter their age using the `input()` function, converts the response to an integer using the `int()` function, and stores the result in the `age` variable.\n3. It prints a personalized greeting message using the `print()` function, concatenating the string \"Hello\" with the value of `name` using the `+` operator.\n4. It checks whether the user is eligible to vote by comparing the value of `age` to 18 using an `if` statement. If the user is eligible to vote, it prints a message indicating that they are eligible. If not, it prints a message indicating that they are not eligible.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the user will enter a valid integer value for their age. If the user enters a non-integer value, the program will raise a `ValueError` exception. You may want to add error handling to handle such cases.",
