  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses if/else statements to display a weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n```python\ndef display_weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Displays a weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature < 0:\n        print(\"It's freezing! Wear warm clothing and stay indoors.\")\n    elif 0 <= temperature < 10:\n        print(\"It's cold. Wear a jacket and gloves to stay warm.\")\n    elif 10 <= temperature < 20:\n        print(\"It's mild. Perfect weather for outdoor activities.\")\n    elif 20 <= temperature < 30:\n        print(\"It's warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen and stay hydrated.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's hot! Stay indoors during the hottest part of the day and drink plenty of water.\")\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    display_weather_forecast(temperature)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n------------------------\n\n1. The `display_weather_forecast` function takes a temperature as input and uses if/else statements to determine the weather forecast.\n2. The temperature ranges are defined as follows:\n\t* Freezing: < 0\u00b0C\n\t* Cold: 0-10\u00b0C\n\t* Mild: 10-20\u00b0C\n\t* Warm: 20-30\u00b0C\n\t* Hot: > 30\u00b0C\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the current temperature and calls the `display_weather_forecast` function with the user's input.\n4. The program prints the corresponding weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a temperature of -5\u00b0C to see the \"It's freezing!\" forecast.\n* Enter a temperature of 15\u00b0C to see the \"It's mild.\" forecast.\n* Enter a temperature of 35\u00b0C to see the \"It's hot!\" forecast.",
