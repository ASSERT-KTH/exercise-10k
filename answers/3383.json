  "answer": "**Checking if an Element is in a List**\n======================================\n\nHere's a simple function written in Python that checks if a given element is in a list:\n\n```python\ndef check_element_in_list(element, lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given element is in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        element (any): The element to be searched for in the list.\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the element is in the list, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return element in lst\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(check_element_in_list(3, my_list))  # Output: True\n    print(check_element_in_list(6, my_list))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's built-in `in` operator to check if the element is in the list. The `in` operator returns `True` if the element is found in the list and `False` otherwise.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `element` (the element to search for) and `lst` (the list to search in).\n2. The `in` operator is used to check if `element` is in `lst`.\n3. The result of the `in` operator is returned by the function.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because the `in` operator has to potentially check every element in the list.",
