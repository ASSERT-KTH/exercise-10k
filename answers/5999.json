  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a generator that yields the squares of the numbers",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates the squares of numbers from a given list. This function will utilize a generator to efficiently produce the squared values. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef square_generator(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a generator that yields the squares of the numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The square of each number in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for num in numbers:\n        \n        # Check if the current item is a number\n        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n            raise TypeError(\"All elements in the list must be numbers\")\n        \n        # Calculate the square of the current number\n        square = num ** 2\n        \n        # Yield the square of the current number\n        yield square\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquares = square_generator(numbers)\n\n# Print the squares of the numbers\nfor square in squares:\n    print(square)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `square_generator` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a generator that yields the squares of these numbers. It first checks if the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` if not.\n* It then iterates over each number in the input list, checks if the current item is a number, and raises a `TypeError` if it encounters a non-numeric value.\n* For each valid number, it calculates the square using the exponentiation operator `**` and yields this squared value.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to create a generator from a list of numbers and print the squares of these numbers.",
