  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array containing all unique elements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses sets to remove duplicates and then converts the result back to a list:\n\n```python\ndef unique_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all unique elements.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr1 (list): The first input array.\n    arr2 (list): The second input array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new array containing all unique elements from the input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Combine the two arrays into one\n    combined_array = arr1 + arr2\n    \n    # Convert the combined array to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_set = set(combined_array)\n    \n    # Convert the set back to a list\n    unique_list = list(unique_set)\n    \n    return unique_list\n\n# Example usage\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(unique_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1.  It first combines the two input arrays into one using the `+` operator.\n2.  Then it converts the combined array to a set using the `set()` function. This removes any duplicates because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate elements.\n3.  Finally, it converts the set back to a list using the `list()` function and returns the result.\n\nNote that this solution does not preserve the original order of elements. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef unique_elements_ordered(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all unique elements, preserving the original order.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr1 (list): The first input array.\n    arr2 (list): The second input array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new array containing all unique elements from the input arrays, in the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Create an empty list to store the unique elements\n    unique_list = []\n    \n    # Combine the two arrays into one\n    combined_array = arr1 + arr2\n    \n    # Iterate over the combined array\n    for element in combined_array:\n        # Check if the element is not in the seen set\n        if element not in seen:\n            # Add the element to the seen set\n            seen.add(element)\n            # Add the element to the unique list\n            unique_list.append(element)\n    \n    return unique_list\n\n# Example usage\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(unique_elements_ordered(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1.  It creates an empty set `seen` to keep track of elements that have been seen so far.\n2.  It creates an empty list `unique_list` to store the unique elements.\n3.  It combines the two input arrays into one using the `+` operator.\n4.  It iterates over the combined array, and for each element, it checks if the element is not in the `seen` set.\n5.  If the element is not in the `seen` set, it adds the element to the `seen` set and to the `unique_list`.\n6.  Finally, it returns the `unique_list`, which contains all unique elements from the input arrays, in the original order.",
