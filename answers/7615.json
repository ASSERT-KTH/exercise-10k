  "answer": "**Character Printer Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and prints each character of the string using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_characters(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints each character of the input string.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to print characters from.\n    \"\"\"\n    for char in input_string:\n        print(char)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print_characters(input_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_characters` function takes a string as input and uses a for loop to iterate over each character.\n2. Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to print each character.\n3. In the `main` function, an example string is passed to the `print_characters` function to demonstrate its usage.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code in a file (e.g., `character_printer.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python character_printer.py`). The program will print each character of the input string on a new line.",
