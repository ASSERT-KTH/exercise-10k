  "prompt": "Create a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list `[\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]`.\n2. The `determine_winner` function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input and returns a string indicating the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter their choice. If the user enters 'q', the game exits.\n4. If the user's choice is invalid, they are asked to try again.\n5. The computer's choice is generated using the `get_computer_choice` function.\n6. The user's choice and the computer's choice are displayed, and the winner is determined using the `determine_winner` function.\n7. The result is printed to the console.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Run the program and enter \"rock\" to play a round.\n* Enter \"q\" to quit the game.\n* Enter an invalid choice, such as \"foo\", to see an error message.",
