  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    while score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n*   The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, validates it to ensure it's between 0 and 100, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and displays the result.\n*   The program uses a simple and efficient approach to determine the grade, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  When prompted, enter a score between 0 and 100.\n3.  The program will display the corresponding grade based on the score.\n\nFor example, if you enter a score of 85, the program will output: \"The student's grade is: B\"",
