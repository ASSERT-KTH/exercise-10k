  "answer": "**Garbage Collection Demonstration in Python**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example Python program that demonstrates the concept of garbage collection.\n\n```python\nimport gc\nimport os\nimport psutil\n\n# Get the current process\nprocess = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n\nclass GarbageCollectionExample:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = [i for i in range(1000000)]\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        print(\"Object has been deleted\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the initial memory usage\n    mem_before = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)\n    print(f\"Initial Memory Usage: {mem_before} MB\")\n\n    # Create an instance of the class\n    obj = GarbageCollectionExample()\n\n    # Get the memory usage after creating the object\n    mem_after = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)\n    print(f\"Memory Usage after creating object: {mem_after} MB\")\n\n    # Delete the object\n    del obj\n\n    # Force garbage collection\n    gc.collect()\n\n    # Get the memory usage after deleting the object and forcing garbage collection\n    mem_after_gc = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)\n    print(f\"Memory Usage after deleting object and forcing GC: {mem_after_gc} MB\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The program starts by getting the initial memory usage of the process.\n2. It then creates an instance of the `GarbageCollectionExample` class, which has a large list of integers.\n3. The memory usage is checked again after creating the object.\n4. The object is then deleted using the `del` statement.\n5. The `gc.collect()` function is called to force garbage collection.\n6. Finally, the memory usage is checked again after deleting the object and forcing garbage collection.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\n* The memory usage should increase after creating the object.\n* After deleting the object and forcing garbage collection, the memory usage should decrease.\n\nNote: The actual memory usage may vary depending on the system and Python interpreter being used. The code is meant to demonstrate the concept of garbage collection, not to provide exact memory usage measurements.",
