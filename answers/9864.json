  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and asks the user to guess it.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\nThis program will keep asking the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number. It will also give hints if the user's guess is too high or too low. The number of tries the user takes to guess the number is also tracked and displayed at the end.",
