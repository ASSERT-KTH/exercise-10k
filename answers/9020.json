  "answer": "### Concurrent Tasks using Async Functions\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses async functions to perform concurrent tasks. This example simulates two concurrent tasks: `task1` and `task2`, which run asynchronously.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n# Define an async function for task1\nasync def task1():\n    \"\"\"Simulate task1 that takes 2 seconds to complete\"\"\"\n    print(\"Task 1 started\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate task1 taking 2 seconds\n    print(\"Task 1 completed\")\n    return \"Task 1 result\"\n\n# Define an async function for task2\nasync def task2():\n    \"\"\"Simulate task2 that takes 3 seconds to complete\"\"\"\n    print(\"Task 2 started\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate task2 taking 3 seconds\n    print(\"Task 2 completed\")\n    return \"Task 2 result\"\n\n# Define the main async function\nasync def main():\n    \"\"\"Run task1 and task2 concurrently\"\"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n    # Run task1 and task2 concurrently using asyncio.gather\n    results = await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())\n    print(f\"Results: {results}\")\n    print(f\"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds\")\n\n# Run the main async function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define two async functions, `task1` and `task2`, which simulate tasks that take 2 and 3 seconds to complete, respectively.\n2. We define the `main` async function, which runs `task1` and `task2` concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.\n3. We use `asyncio.run` to run the `main` async function.\n4. The `asyncio.gather` function allows us to run multiple async functions concurrently and wait for all of them to complete.\n5. The results of the concurrent tasks are stored in the `results` variable and printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nTask 1 started\nTask 2 started\nTask 1 completed\nTask 2 completed\nResults: ['Task 1 result', 'Task 2 result']\nTotal execution time: 3.002434 seconds\n```\n\nNote that the total execution time is approximately 3 seconds, which is the maximum time taken by the two tasks. This demonstrates that the tasks are running concurrently, and the total execution time is not the sum of the individual task times.",
