  "prompt": "Write a program that converts a grade from a percentage to a letter grade. If the percentage is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the percentage is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the percentage is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the percentage is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the percentage is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef convert_percentage_to_grade(percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a percentage to a letter grade.\n    \n    Args:\n        percentage (float): A percentage between 0 and 100.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding letter grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if percentage < 0 or percentage > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Percentage must be between 0 and 100.\")\n    \n    if percentage >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif 80 <= percentage < 90:\n        return 'B'\n    elif 70 <= percentage < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    elif 60 <= percentage < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    percentages = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]\n    for percentage in percentages:\n        grade = convert_percentage_to_grade(percentage)\n        print(f\"{percentage}% is equivalent to {grade}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `convert_percentage_to_grade` function takes a percentage as input and returns the corresponding letter grade.\n2. It checks if the input percentage is within the valid range (0-100). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It uses if-elif-else statements to determine the letter grade based on the percentage.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with example percentages.\n5. The program prints the equivalent letter grade for each percentage.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n95% is equivalent to A.\n85% is equivalent to B.\n75% is equivalent to C.\n65% is equivalent to D.\n55% is equivalent to F.\n```",
