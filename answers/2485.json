  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Program**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. This algorithm repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The absolute value of `a` is returned as the GCD.\n4. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated with two numbers, 48 and 18.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nGCD of 48 and 18: 6\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers.\n* The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n* You can modify the `main` function to accept user input or test the `gcd` function with different numbers.",
