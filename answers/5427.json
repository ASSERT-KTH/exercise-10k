  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a game of rock paper scissors between the user and the computer. The user is prompted to choose one of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of rock paper scissors\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Run the program and enter \"rock\" when prompted. The computer will make a random choice, and the program will determine the winner.\n2. Run the program and enter \"paper\" when prompted. The computer will make a random choice, and the program will determine the winner.\n3. Run the program and enter \"scissors\" when prompted. The computer will make a random choice, and the program will determine the winner.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python rock_paper_scissors.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.",
