  "answer": "**Mad Libs Story Generator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates Mad Libs stories using a for loop. It prompts the user for different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) and then uses these words to fill in the blanks in a story.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define the story template\nstory_template = \"\"\"\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a {adjective1} {noun1}.\nThis {noun1} had a {adjective2} {body_part} and loved to {verb1}.\nOne day, while {verb2} through the forest, the {noun1} stumbled upon a {adjective3} {noun2}.\nThe {noun1} was so {adjective4} that it decided to {verb3} the {noun2} home.\nFrom that day on, the {noun1} and {noun2} became the best of {plural_noun}.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_word(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Get a word from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        word = input(prompt)\n        if word:\n            return word\n        print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\ndef generate_story():\n    \"\"\"Generate a Mad Libs story.\"\"\"\n    words = {\n        \"adjective1\": get_word(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"noun1\": get_word(\"Enter a noun: \"),\n        \"adjective2\": get_word(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"body_part\": get_word(\"Enter a body part: \"),\n        \"verb1\": get_word(\"Enter a verb: \"),\n        \"verb2\": get_word(\"Enter a verb: \"),\n        \"adjective3\": get_word(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"noun2\": get_word(\"Enter a noun: \"),\n        \"adjective4\": get_word(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"verb3\": get_word(\"Enter a verb: \"),\n        \"plural_noun\": get_word(\"Enter a plural noun: \")\n    }\n\n    # Use a for loop to fill in the story template\n    story = story_template\n    for key, value in words.items():\n        story = story.replace(\"{\" + key + \"}\", value)\n\n    print(\"Here is your Mad Libs story:\")\n    print(story)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Run the program.\"\"\"\n    generate_story()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the requested words when prompted (e.g., adjective, noun, verb).\n3. The program will generate a Mad Libs story using the words you entered and print it to the console.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simple story template and does not include any error checking or validation beyond ensuring that the user enters a word. You can modify the program to use a more complex story template or add additional features as needed.",
