  "prompt": "Create a program that finds the index of a given element in a list. If the element is not found, return -1. The program should handle lists of varying sizes and elements of different data types.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a given element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        elem: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Attempt to find the index of the element\n        index = lst.index(elem)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the element is not found, return -1\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(my_list, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(my_list, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\nI've implemented the `find_index` function as specified, with a docstring that describes the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. The function uses a `try`-`except` block to attempt to find the index of the element using the `index` method, and returns -1 if a `ValueError` exception is raised. I've also included example usage of the function to demonstrate its behavior.",
