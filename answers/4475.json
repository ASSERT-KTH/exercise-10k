  "answer": "**Sum of Elements Meeting a Condition Using a While Loop**\n===========================================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that finds the sum of elements in a list that meet a specific condition (in this case, numbers greater than 3) using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef sum_condition_met(lst, condition_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of elements in a list that meet a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of numbers.\n        condition_value (int): The value used for the condition.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of elements meeting the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    index = 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    while index < len(lst):\n        # Check if the current element meets the condition\n        if lst[index] > condition_value:\n            # If it does, add it to the total sum\n            total_sum += lst[index]\n        # Move to the next element\n        index += 1\n    return total_sum\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ncondition_value = 3\nresult = sum_condition_met(numbers, condition_value)\nprint(f\"Sum of numbers greater than {condition_value}: {result}\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. Define a function `sum_condition_met` that takes a list `lst` and a `condition_value` as inputs.\n2. Initialize two variables: `index` to keep track of the current position in the list, and `total_sum` to accumulate the sum of elements meeting the condition.\n3. Use a while loop to iterate through the list, starting from the first element (`index = 0`).\n4. Inside the loop, check if the current element (`lst[index]`) meets the condition (`> condition_value`).\n5. If the condition is met, add the current element to `total_sum`.\n6. Increment `index` to move to the next element in the list.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all elements in the list have been processed (`index < len(lst)`).\n8. Return the final `total_sum`.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nFor the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and a condition value of `3`, the output will be:\n\n```\nSum of numbers greater than 3: 35\n```",
