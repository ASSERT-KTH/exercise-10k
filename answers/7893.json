  "prompt": "Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n, where n is provided by the user. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and print each one on a new line.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\n# Get the user input for n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function. It then converts the user's input to an integer using the `int()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.\n\nNext, it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the `for` loop assigns each number in the sequence to the variable `i` on each iteration.\n\nFinally, it prints the value of `i` on each iteration using the `print()` function. The result is that the numbers from 1 to `n` are printed, one per line.",
