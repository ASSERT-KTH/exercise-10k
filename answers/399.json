  "answer": "**Cylinder Surface Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe surface area of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\n`A = 2 * \u03c0 * r^2 + 2 * \u03c0 * r * h`\n\nwhere:\n- `A` is the surface area\n- `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- `r` is the radius of the cylinder\n- `h` is the height of the cylinder\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    surface_area = 2 * math.pi * (radius ** 2) + 2 * math.pi * radius * height\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    radius = 5.0  # cm\n    height = 10.0  # cm\n\n    surface_area = calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height)\n    print(f\"The surface area of the cylinder is {surface_area:.2f} square cm\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_cylinder_surface_area` that takes the radius and height of the cylinder as input.\n2. The function checks if the radius and height are non-negative, raising a `ValueError` if either is negative.\n3. The function calculates the surface area using the formula and returns the result.\n4. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated, calculating the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm.\n5. The result is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `cylinder_surface_area.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python cylinder_surface_area.py`). The program will output the surface area of the example cylinder. You can modify the `radius` and `height` variables in the `main` function to calculate the surface area of different cylinders.",
