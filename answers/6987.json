  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the speed and time of an object as input and returns the distance traveled.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the distance traveled by an object given its speed and time:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(speed, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance traveled by an object given its speed and time.\n\n    Args:\n        speed (float): The speed of the object in meters per second.\n        time (float): The time the object traveled in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance traveled by the object in meters.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = speed * time\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the speed and time from the user\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed of the object in meters per second: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time the object traveled in seconds: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the distance\n    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)\n    print(f\"The object traveled {distance} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two arguments: `speed` and `time`.\n2. It calculates the distance by multiplying the speed and time.\n3. The `main` function gets the speed and time from the user, calls `calculate_distance`, and prints the result.\n4. The program uses `float` to handle decimal numbers.\n\n### Example use case\n\n* Enter the speed of the object in meters per second: 5\n* Enter the time the object traveled in seconds: 10\n* The object traveled 50.0 meters.\n\nNote: This program assumes a constant speed and does not account for acceleration or deceleration.",
