  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from both dictionaries.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that merges two dictionaries into a new one, ensuring all key-value pairs are included. This function will handle potential key duplicates by giving precedence to the second dictionary's values. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function merges two dictionaries into a new dictionary.\n    \n    If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first dictionary.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we'll create a copy of the first dictionary. This is to avoid modifying the original dictionary.\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    \n    # Then, we'll update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary.\n    # If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first dictionary.\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    \n    # Finally, we'll return the merged dictionary.\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\nprint(merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by creating a copy of the first dictionary (`dict1`) using the `copy()` method and assign it to `merged_dict`. This step is crucial to avoid modifying the original dictionary.\n*   Next, we use the `update()` method on `merged_dict` to incorporate key-value pairs from the second dictionary (`dict2`). If any keys are duplicated, the values from `dict2` will override those in `merged_dict`.\n*   Finally, the function returns `merged_dict`, which now contains all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.",
