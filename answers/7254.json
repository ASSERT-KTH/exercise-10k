  "answer": "Here is a Python implementation of Bubble Sort:\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using Bubble Sort.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Iterate over the array n-1 times\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate over the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function takes an array `arr` as input and gets its length `n`.\n2. The outer loop iterates `n-1` times.\n3. The inner loop iterates over the array from the first element to the `(n-i-1)`th element.\n4. If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped.\n5. If no swaps are made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted and the function returns.\n6. The sorted array is returned.\n\n**Time complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. **Space complexity:** O(1) since only a single additional variable is used.",
