  "answer": "Let's generate a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence pattern. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nHere's the sequence:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nTo generate this sequence, we can use the following formula:\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n\nWhere F(n) is the nth number in the sequence.\n\nFor example, to get the next number in the sequence after 8, we would calculate:\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 5 + 3 = 8\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nAnd so on.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to generate the Fibonacci sequence:\n```\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(sequence) < n:\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n    return sequence\n\nprint(fibonacci(10))\n```\nThis code generates the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWould you like to try a different sequence or pattern?",
