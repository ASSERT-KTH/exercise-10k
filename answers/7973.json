  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the grade of a student based on their score. The grade is determined by the following scale:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n**Program Code**\n---------------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n\n    # Check if the score is valid\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate the grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n\n        # Print the grade\n        print(f\"The grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a score of 92 to get a grade of A\n* Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B\n* Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C\n* Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D\n* Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the program code in a file named `grade_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3.
