  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list as input and returns the average value of the list.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the average value of a list:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average value of a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average value of the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lst:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n\n    try:\n        return sum(lst) / len(lst)\n    except TypeError:\n        raise TypeError(\"List contains non-numeric values\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average value of the list is: {average}\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns the average value.\n*   We check if the list is empty and raise a `ValueError` if it is.\n*   We use a try-except block to catch any `TypeError` that might occur if the list contains non-numeric values.\n*   We calculate the average by summing up all the elements in the list using the built-in `sum` function and dividing by the number of elements in the list using the `len` function.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_average` function with a sample list of numbers and handle any potential errors that might occur.",
