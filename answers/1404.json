  "prompt": "Create a program that prints out a weather forecast based on the temperature. If the temperature is above 25, print 'Hot', between 15 and 25 print 'Mild', between 5 and 15 print 'Cool', and below 5 print 'Cold'.",
  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program prints out a weather forecast based on the temperature. The forecast is categorized into four conditions: Hot, Mild, Cool, and Cold.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > 25:\n        return 'Hot'\n    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:\n        return 'Mild'\n    elif 5 <= temperature < 15:\n        return 'Cool'\n    else:\n        return 'Cold'\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature)\n    print(f\"The weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_weather_forecast` function takes the temperature as an argument and returns the corresponding weather forecast.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the temperature, calls the `get_weather_forecast` function, and prints the result.\n3. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the temperature is 30, the program will print: `The weather forecast is: Hot`\n* If the temperature is 20, the program will print: `The weather forecast is: Mild`\n* If the temperature is 10, the program will print: `The weather forecast is: Cool`\n* If the temperature is 0, the program will print: `The weather forecast is: Cold`\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `weather_forecast.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python weather_forecast.py`). Then, enter the temperature when prompted to see the weather forecast.",
