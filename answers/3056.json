  "answer": "### Lambda Function to Double a Number\n\nHere's a simple lambda function in Python that doubles a given number:\n\n```python\ndouble_number = lambda x: x * 2\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(double_number(5))  # Outputs: 10\n```\n\nThis function takes one argument `x`, which is the number to be doubled, and returns its double value. The `lambda` keyword is used to define small, anonymous functions in Python. \n\nIf you want to use this lambda function within a larger context, such as a class or another function, you can assign it to a variable or pass it directly as needed. \n\n### Using Lambda with Map Function\n\nYou can also use this lambda function with the `map()` function to double all numbers in a list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndoubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))\n\nprint(doubled_numbers)  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how lambda functions can be effectively used with built-in functions like `map()` for concise and readable transformations of data.",
