  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_integers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(range(1, n + 1))\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nresult = sum_of_integers(num)\nprint(f\"The sum of integers from 1 to {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sum_of_integers` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. The `sum` function is a built-in Python function that adds up all the elements in a given iterable, and the `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). The `+ 1` in `n + 1` is necessary because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value. \n\nYou can run this program, enter a positive integer when prompted, and it will print the sum of all integers from 1 to that number. \n\nAlternatively, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula allows you to calculate the sum directly without having to iterate over the range of numbers. Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_integers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nresult = sum_of_integers(num)\nprint(f\"The sum of integers from 1 to {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis version of the function is more efficient, especially for large values of `n`, because it avoids the overhead of creating a range of numbers and summing them up. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.",
