  "prompt": "Create a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3):\n    # Perform arithmetic operations\n    sum_result = num1 + num2 + num3\n    subtraction_result = num1 - num2 - num3\n    multiplication_result = num1 * num2 * num3\n    division_result = num1 / num2 / num3\n\n    # Print results\n    print(\"Sum:\", sum_result)\n    print(\"Subtraction:\", subtraction_result)\n    print(\"Multiplication:\", multiplication_result)\n    print(\"Division:\", division_result)\n\n# Main program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Get input numbers from user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter third number: \"))\n\n    # Call arithmetic_operations function\n    arithmetic_operations(num1, num2, num3)\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, including the comments and the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.",
