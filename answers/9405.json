  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given integer is a prime number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks for divisors from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).\n4. If any divisor is found, the function returns `False`.\n5. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates example usage by asking the user to input a number and checking if it is prime.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `25` - Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23` - Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `37` - Output: `37 is a prime number.`\n\nNote: This program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized integers. For larger integers, more advanced algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
