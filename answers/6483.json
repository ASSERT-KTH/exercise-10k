  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum:\n\n```python\n# Get the first number from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n# Get the second number from the user\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the two numbers\nsum = num1 + num2\n\n# Print the sum\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The program uses the built-in `input` function to get the two numbers from the user.\n* The `float` function is used to convert the input strings to floating-point numbers, allowing the user to enter decimal numbers.\n* The sum of the two numbers is calculated using the `+` operator and stored in the `sum` variable.\n* Finally, the program prints the sum to the console using the `print` function.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 5\nEnter the second number: 3\nThe sum of 5.0 and 3.0 is 8.0\n```\n\nThis program can be saved to a file (e.g. `sum_program.py`) and run from the command line using `python sum_program.py`.",
