  "answer": "### Storing and Printing Date and Time in a Specific Format\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that demonstrates how to store a date and time in a variable and print it in a specific format:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef store_and_print_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second):\n    \"\"\"\n    Stores a date and time in a variable and prints it in a specific format.\n    \n    Args:\n        year (int): The year of the date.\n        month (int): The month of the date.\n        day (int): The day of the date.\n        hour (int): The hour of the time.\n        minute (int): The minute of the time.\n        second (int): The second of the time.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Store the date and time in a variable\n    date_time = datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)\n\n    # Print the date and time in a specific format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)\n    print(date_time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n# Example usage\nstore_and_print_datetime(2024, 9, 16, 10, 30, 0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module, which provides classes for manipulating dates and times.\n*   We define a function `store_and_print_datetime` that takes the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second as arguments.\n*   Inside the function, we create a `datetime` object using the provided arguments and store it in the `date_time` variable.\n*   We use the `strftime` method to format the date and time as a string in the desired format (`\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"`).\n*   Finally, we print the formatted date and time.\n\n### Format Codes\n\nThe format codes used in the `strftime` method are:\n\n*   `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number (e.g., 2024)\n*   `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 09)\n*   `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 16)\n*   `%H`: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 10)\n*   `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 30)\n*   `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 00)",
