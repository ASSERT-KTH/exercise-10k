  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number for which to calculate the factorial.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ntry:\n    print(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It checks if `n` is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n3. If `n` is 0, it returns 1, because the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.\n4. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `result` to 1 and uses a for loop to multiply `result` by each integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n5. Finally, it returns the calculated factorial.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* `factorial(5)` returns `120`, because `5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120`.\n* `factorial(0)` returns `1`, because `0! = 1` by definition.\n* `factorial(-1)` raises a `ValueError`, because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.",
