  "answer": "### Symmetric Difference of Dictionaries\n#### Problem Description\nCreate two dictionaries with names of students as keys and their grades as values. Calculate the symmetric difference of the two dictionaries and print the resulting dictionary.\n\n#### Code Solution\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference of two dictionaries.\n    \n    The symmetric difference of two dictionaries is a new dictionary with keys that are in exactly one of the input dictionaries.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: The symmetric difference of the two input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the symmetric difference of the keys\n    symmetric_diff_keys = set(dict1.keys()).symmetric_difference(set(dict2.keys()))\n    \n    # Create a new dictionary with the symmetric difference keys and their corresponding values\n    symmetric_diff_dict = {key: dict1.get(key, dict2.get(key)) for key in symmetric_diff_keys}\n    \n    return symmetric_diff_dict\n\n# Example usage\nstudents1 = {\n    \"John\": 85,\n    \"Alice\": 90,\n    \"Bob\": 78,\n    \"Charlie\": 92\n}\n\nstudents2 = {\n    \"John\": 85,\n    \"Alice\": 91,\n    \"David\": 88,\n    \"Eve\": 95\n}\n\nsymmetric_diff = symmetric_difference(students1, students2)\n\nprint(\"Symmetric Difference:\")\nfor key, value in symmetric_diff.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `symmetric_difference` function takes two dictionaries as input and calculates their symmetric difference.\n*   It uses the `set` data structure to calculate the symmetric difference of the keys in the two dictionaries.\n*   Then, it creates a new dictionary with the symmetric difference keys and their corresponding values.\n*   In the example usage, we define two dictionaries `students1` and `students2` with student names as keys and their grades as values.\n*   We calculate the symmetric difference of the two dictionaries using the `symmetric_difference` function and print the resulting dictionary.\n\n#### Output\n```\nSymmetric Difference:\nBob: 78\nCharlie: 92\nDavid: 88\nEve: 95\nAlice: 90\n```",
