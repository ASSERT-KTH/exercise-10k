  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that handles a division by zero error and prints out an error message:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(a, b):\n    try:\n        result = a / b\n        print(f\"{a} divided by {b} is {result}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\n# Test the function with valid input\ndivide_numbers(10, 2)\n\n# Test the function with invalid input\ndivide_numbers(10, 0)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and attempts to divide the first number by the second. If the division is successful, it prints out the result. However, if the second number is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, which we catch and handle by printing out an error message.\n\nWhen you run this program, you should see the following output:\n```\n10 divided by 2 is 5.0\nError: Division by zero is not allowed.\n```\n\nThis shows that the program successfully handles the division by zero error and prints out an informative error message instead of crashing.",
