  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the sides of a triangle as input and returns its perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the perimeter of a triangle given its sides:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a triangle given its sides.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The length of the first side.\n        b (float): The length of the second side.\n        c (float): The length of the third side.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the triangle.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input sides cannot form a valid triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input sides can form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input sides cannot form a valid triangle.\")\n\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = a + b + c\n\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the sides of the triangle from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first side: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second side: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of the third side: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the perimeter\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the triangle is: {perimeter}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Valid Triangle**: If the user enters `3`, `4`, and `5` as the sides of the triangle, the program will output `The perimeter of the triangle is: 12.0`.\n2. **Invalid Triangle**: If the user enters `1`, `2`, and `5` as the sides of the triangle, the program will output `The input sides cannot form a valid triangle.`.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The `calculate_perimeter` function takes the lengths of the three sides of the triangle as input and returns their sum.\n2. The function first checks if the input sides can form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n3. If the input sides are valid, the function calculates the perimeter by summing the lengths of the three sides.\n4. The `main` function gets the sides of the triangle from the user, calls the `calculate_perimeter` function, and prints the result.\n5. If the input sides cannot form a valid triangle, the program catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.",
