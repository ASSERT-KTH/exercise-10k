  "answer": "**Checking if a Key is in a Dictionary**\n\nYou can check if a key is in a dictionary using the `in` keyword in Python.\n\n### Example Code\n```python\ndef check_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a key is in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to check.\n        key: The key to look for.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the key is in the dictionary, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return key in dictionary\n\n# Example usage\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(check_key(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Output: True\nprint(check_key(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `in` keyword checks if a key is present in the dictionary.\n* The function `check_key` takes a dictionary and a key as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the key is in the dictionary.\n* You can use this function to check if a key is in a dictionary before trying to access its value.\n\n### Alternative Method\n\nYou can also use the `dict.get()` method to check if a key is in a dictionary. If the key is not found, it returns `None` by default.\n\n```python\ndef check_key(dictionary, key):\n    return dictionary.get(key) is not None\n```\n\nHowever, this method is not recommended if you only need to check if the key is present, as it also retrieves the value associated with the key. The `in` keyword is more efficient and readable for this purpose.",
