  "answer": "**GCD Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate GCD\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n\n    # Display result\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` is 0.\n3. In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively.\n4. Once `b` is 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n5. The `main` function gets user input for two numbers, calculates their GCD using the `calculate_gcd` function, and displays the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first number: 48\n3. Enter the second number: 18\n4. The program will display: \"The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6\"\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it suitable for large numbers.",
