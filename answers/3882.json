  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThe game generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number, and after each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess the number: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}. Thanks for playing!\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1. Run the code to start the game.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Type your guess and press Enter.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the number.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to stop playing and reveal the correct answer.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The user guesses a number that is too low: the program responds with \"Your guess is too low. Try again!\"\n* The user guesses a number that is too high: the program responds with \"Your guess is too high. Try again!\"\n* The user guesses the correct number: the program responds with \"Congratulations! You found the number in X attempts.\"\n* The user types \"quit\" to stop playing: the program reveals the correct answer and thanks the user for playing.",
