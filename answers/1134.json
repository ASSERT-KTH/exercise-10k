  "answer": "**Conversation Simulator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program simulates a conversation with the user by using a dictionary to map user inputs to predefined responses. The program continues to prompt the user for input until the user decides to exit.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# conversation_simulator.py\n\nclass ConversationSimulator:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.responses = {\n            \"hello\": \"Hi! How are you today?\",\n            \"how are you\": \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\",\n            \"what's your name\": \"My name is Conversation Simulator.\",\n            \"exit\": \"Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.\",\n            \"default\": \"I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?\"\n        }\n\n    def get_response(self, user_input):\n        user_input = user_input.lower()\n        for keyword in self.responses:\n            if keyword in user_input:\n                return self.responses[keyword]\n        return self.responses[\"default\"]\n\n    def start_conversation(self):\n        print(\"Welcome to the conversation simulator! Type 'exit' to quit.\")\n        while True:\n            user_input = input(\"You: \")\n            if user_input.lower() == \"exit\":\n                print(\"Simulator: \", self.get_response(user_input))\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Simulator: \", self.get_response(user_input))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simulator = ConversationSimulator()\n    simulator.start_conversation()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program using `python conversation_simulator.py`.\n2. Type a message to the simulator, such as \"hello\".\n3. The simulator will respond with a predefined message, such as \"Hi! How are you today?\".\n4. Continue chatting with the simulator by typing messages and receiving responses.\n5. Type \"exit\" to quit the conversation.\n\n**Adding Custom Responses**\n---------------------------\n\nTo add custom responses, simply add a new key-value pair to the `responses` dictionary in the `ConversationSimulator` class. For example:\n```python\nself.responses[\"what's your favorite food\"] = \"I don't have personal preferences, but I can tell you about different types of cuisine!\"\n```\nThis will add a new response to the simulator's vocabulary. You can add as many custom responses as you like to make the conversation more engaging and interactive.",
