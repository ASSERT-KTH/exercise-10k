  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(\"The average of the numbers is:\", average)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the numbers.\n3. It uses a for loop to iterate over each number in the list, adding it to the `total`.\n4. After the loop, it returns the `total` divided by the length of the list, which is the average.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Note**\n--------\n\n* This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n* You may want to add error handling to handle this case, depending on your requirements. For example, you could return a special value like `None` or raise a custom exception.",
