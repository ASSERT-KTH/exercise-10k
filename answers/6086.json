  "answer": "### Grade Validation Program\n#### Overview\nThe following program uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for input until a valid grade is entered. A valid grade is defined as a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) or a numerical grade between 0 and 100.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef get_valid_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Continuously asks the user for input until a valid grade is entered.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Please enter a grade (A, B, C, D, F, or a number between 0 and 100): \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a letter grade\n        if user_input.upper() in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\"]:\n            return user_input.upper()\n        \n        # Check if the input is a numerical grade\n        try:\n            numerical_grade = int(user_input)\n            if 0 <= numerical_grade <= 100:\n                return numerical_grade\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid grade. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) or a number between 0 and 100.\")\n\ndef main():\n    valid_grade = get_valid_grade()\n    print(f\"You entered a valid grade: {valid_grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter an invalid grade, such as \"G\" or \"101\".\n3. The program will print an error message and ask for input again.\n4. Enter a valid grade, such as \"A\" or \"90\".\n5. The program will print a success message with the valid grade.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while True` loop to continuously ask for input until a valid grade is entered. It checks for both letter grades and numerical grades, and handles invalid inputs with error messages.",
