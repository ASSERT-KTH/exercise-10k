  "prompt": "Write a program to take a text as input and analyze its content, including word frequency, sentence length, and character frequency",
  "answer": "Here's an example program written in Python that analyzes the content of a given text:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lower case\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text).lower()\n\n    # Split text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Calculate word frequency\n    word_frequency = Counter(words)\n\n    # Calculate sentence length\n    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', text)\n    sentence_length = [len(sentence.split()) for sentence in sentences if sentence]\n\n    # Calculate character frequency\n    character_frequency = Counter(text)\n\n    return word_frequency, sentence_length, character_frequency\n\ndef print_analysis(word_frequency, sentence_length, character_frequency):\n    # Print word frequency\n    print(\"Word Frequency:\")\n    for word, frequency in word_frequency.most_common():\n        print(f\"{word}: {frequency}\")\n\n    # Print sentence length\n    print(\"\\nSentence Length:\")\n    for i, length in enumerate(sentence_length):\n        print(f\"Sentence {i+1}: {length} words\")\n\n    # Print character frequency\n    print(\"\\nCharacter Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in character_frequency.most_common():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter a text: \")\n    word_frequency, sentence_length, character_frequency = analyze_text(text)\n    print_analysis(word_frequency, sentence_length, character_frequency)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**: The `analyze_text` function first removes punctuation from the input text using regular expressions and converts it to lower case to ensure the analysis is case-insensitive.\n2. **Word Frequency Analysis**: It splits the text into words and uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word.\n3. **Sentence Length Analysis**: It splits the text into sentences using regular expressions and calculates the number of words in each sentence.\n4. **Character Frequency Analysis**: It uses the `Counter` class again to count the frequency of each character in the text.\n5. **Printing the Analysis**: The `print_analysis` function prints the results of the analysis, including the word frequency, sentence length, and character frequency.\n6. **Main Function**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter a text, calls the `analyze_text` function to perform the analysis, and then calls the `print_analysis` function to print the results.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this program:\n\n```\nEnter a text: This is an example sentence. This sentence is another example.\n```\n\nThe program will then print the word frequency, sentence length, and character frequency of the input text.",
