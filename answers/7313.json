  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a character as input from the user and prints out its ASCII value.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef print_ascii_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a character as input from the user and prints out its ASCII value.\n    \"\"\"\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n    \n    # Check if the user has entered a single character\n    if len(char) != 1:\n        print(\"Please enter a single character.\")\n    else:\n        # Get the ASCII value of the character\n        ascii_value = ord(char)\n        \n        # Print the ASCII value\n        print(f\"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ascii_value}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_ascii_value()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `print_ascii_value` function prompts the user to enter a character.\n*   It checks if the input is a single character. If not, it displays an error message.\n*   If the input is valid, it uses the built-in `ord` function to get the ASCII value of the character.\n*   Finally, it prints out the ASCII value.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a character. If you enter a single character, it will print out its ASCII value. For example:\n\n```\nEnter a character: A\nThe ASCII value of 'A' is 65.\n```",
