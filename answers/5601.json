  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with the provided information.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\n# Program to ask user for name and age, then print a greeting message\n\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ask the user for their name and age.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print a greeting message with the provided name and age.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The program is divided into three functions: `get_user_info()`, `print_greeting()`, and `main()`.\n* `get_user_info()` asks the user for their name and age, validating that the age is a whole number.\n* `print_greeting()` takes the user's name and age as arguments and prints a greeting message.\n* `main()` calls `get_user_info()` to get the user's information, then calls `print_greeting()` to print the greeting message.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter your name and age. After you enter the information, it will print a greeting message with your name and age. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```",
