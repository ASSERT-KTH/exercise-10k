  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the future value of an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_future_value(principal, interest_rate, time_period):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the future value of an investment.\n\n    Args:\n    principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.\n    interest_rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n    time_period (int): The number of years the money is invested for.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The future value of the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the future value using the formula for compound interest\n    future_value = principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** time_period\n\n    return future_value\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in percent): \")) / 100\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the future value\n    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, interest_rate, time_period)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The future value of the investment is: ${future_value:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `calculate_future_value` that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as arguments and returns the future value of the investment. The future value is calculated using the formula for compound interest: `A = P * (1 + r) ^ t`, where `A` is the future value, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.\n\nIn the `main` function, we get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user, calculate the future value, and print the result.\n\nYou can run this program, enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted, and it will print the future value of the investment.",
