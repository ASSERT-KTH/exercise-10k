  "answer": "Here's a Python program that asks the user for a series of grades and calculates the average grade:\n\n```python\ndef get_grade_point(grade):\n    \"\"\"Converts a letter grade to a grade point.\"\"\"\n    grade_points = {\n        'A': 4.0,\n        'B': 3.0,\n        'C': 2.0,\n        'D': 1.0,\n        'F': 0.0\n    }\n    return grade_points.get(grade.upper(), None)\n\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the average grade.\"\"\"\n    total_grade_points = sum(grades)\n    return total_grade_points / len(grades)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Grade Average Calculator\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    grades = []\n    while True:\n        grade = input(\"Enter a grade (A, B, C, D, or F), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if grade.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        grade_point = get_grade_point(grade)\n        if grade_point is None:\n            print(\"Invalid grade. Please try again.\")\n        else:\n            grades.append(grade_point)\n\n    if not grades:\n        print(\"No grades entered.\")\n    else:\n        average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n        print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_grade_point` function converts a letter grade to a grade point.\n2. The `calculate_average_grade` function calculates the average grade by summing up all the grade points and dividing by the number of grades.\n3. In the `main` function, the program asks the user to enter grades one by one. If the user enters 'q', the program stops asking for grades.\n4. For each grade entered, the program checks if it's valid. If not, it asks the user to try again.\n5. Once the user is done entering grades, the program calculates the average grade and prints it out.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nGrade Average Calculator\n-------------------------\nEnter a grade (A, B, C, D, or F), or 'q' to quit: A\nEnter a grade (A, B, C, D, or F), or 'q' to quit: B\nEnter a grade (A, B, C, D, or F), or 'q' to quit: C\nEnter a grade (A, B, C, D, or F), or 'q' to quit: q\nAverage grade: 3.00\n```",
