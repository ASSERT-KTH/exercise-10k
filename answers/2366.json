  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the result of a number raised to a power.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the result of a number raised to a power:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of a number raised to a power.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the base raised to the exponent.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and exponent from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the result\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save the above code in a file named `power.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python power.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the base and exponent.\n5. The program will print the result of the base raised to the exponent.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Calculate 2 raised to the power of 3: `power(2, 3)` returns `8`.\n* Calculate 4 raised to the power of 0.5: `power(4, 0.5)` returns `2.0`.\n* Calculate -2 raised to the power of 3: `power(-2, 3)` returns `-8`.",
