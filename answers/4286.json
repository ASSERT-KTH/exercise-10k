  "prompt": "Write a function to check if a key is present in a dictionary.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to check if a specific key exists within a given dictionary, providing a step-by-step guide and code explanation to address your question effectively. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a key is present in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be checked.\n        key (any): The key to be searched for.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the key is present, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input is not a dictionary.\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the 'in' keyword in Python to check if the key is present in the dictionary\n    # The 'in' keyword returns True if the key is found, and False otherwise\n    return key in dictionary\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nprint(check_key(my_dict, 'a'))  # Output: True\nprint(check_key(my_dict, 'd'))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_key` first validates if the provided input `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary type, raising a `TypeError` if it's not, to ensure the function operates on the correct data structure.\n* It then utilizes Python's built-in `in` keyword to check if the specified `key` is present within the `dictionary`, leveraging the efficiency and readability this keyword provides for dictionary lookups.\n* The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the `key` is found in the `dictionary`, making it straightforward to use the result in conditional statements or further processing.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to call the `check_key` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict` and different keys, showcasing its application and expected output.",
