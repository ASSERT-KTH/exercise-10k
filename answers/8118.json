  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the string\n    for char in string:\n        # If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        # If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a frequency of 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    \n    return frequency_dict\n\n# Test the function\nstring = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(char_frequency(string))\n```\n\nThis program will output:\n\n```python\n{'H': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ',': 1, ' ': 1, 'W': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1, '!': 1}\n```\n\nThis shows that the character 'l' appears 3 times in the string, the characters 'o', 'r', 'd', 'H', 'e', 'W', ',', ' ', and '!' each appear once. \n\nAlternatively, you can use Python's built-in `Counter` class from the `collections` module to achieve the same result in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    return dict(Counter(string))\n\n# Test the function\nstring = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(char_frequency(string))\n```",
