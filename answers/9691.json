Ask the user for a mathematical expression.\n2. Split the input into parts and check if it's in the correct format.\n3. Extract the numbers and operation from the input.\n4. Try to convert the numbers to floats.\n5. Evaluate the expression based on the operation.\n6. Print the result.\n\nYou can run this program and enter a mathematical expression to see the result. For example, if you enter `2 + 2`, the program will output `2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0`.",
