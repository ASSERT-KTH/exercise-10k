  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes a phone number as input and checks if it is valid based on the following criteria: the phone number should have exactly 10 digits, and the first digit should not be zero using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a phone number is valid based on the given criteria.\n\n```python\ndef check_phone_number(phone_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a phone number is valid.\n    \n    A phone number is valid if it has exactly 10 digits and the first digit is not zero.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    phone_number (str): The phone number to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the phone number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Remove any non-digit characters from the phone number\n    digits_only = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, phone_number))\n    \n    # Check if the phone number has exactly 10 digits\n    if len(digits_only) != 10:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the first digit is not zero\n    if digits_only[0] == '0':\n        return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the phone number is valid\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    phone_number = input(\"Enter a phone number: \")\n    \n    if check_phone_number(phone_number):\n        print(\"The phone number is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The phone number is not valid.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `check_phone_number` function removes any non-digit characters from the phone number and checks if the resulting string has exactly 10 characters and if the first character is not '0'. The `main` function gets a phone number from the user, checks if it's valid, and prints the result.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `phone_number_validator.py`) and run it with Python (for example, `python phone_number_validator.py`). Then, enter a phone number when prompted, and the program will tell you if it's valid or not.",
