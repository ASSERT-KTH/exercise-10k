  "answer": "### Constant Variables Example\n#### Overview\nThe following code demonstrates how to declare constant variables, assign values to them, and then print their values. Note that true constants are not supported in Python; instead, we use the `final` type hint from the `typing` module (Python 3.8+) to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Final\n\n# Declare and assign constant variables\nPI: Final[float] = 3.14159\nGRAVITY: Final[float] = 9.81\n\ndef main():\n    # Print the values of the constant variables\n    print(\"Value of PI:\", PI)\n    print(\"Value of GRAVITY:\", GRAVITY)\n\n    # Attempting to reassign a constant will result in a warning\n    try:\n        PI = 3.14\n    except AttributeError:\n        print(\"Cannot reassign a constant variable.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n* We import the `Final` type hint from the `typing` module to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned.\n* We declare two constant variables, `PI` and `GRAVITY`, using the `Final` type hint and assign them values.\n* In the `main` function, we print the values of the constant variables.\n* We attempt to reassign the value of `PI` to demonstrate that it is not recommended to do so. While this will not raise an error in Python, it is generally considered good practice to avoid reassigning constants.\n\n#### Running the Code\nTo run this code, save it to a file (e.g., `constants.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python constants.py`). The output should be:\n```\nValue of PI: 3.14159\nValue of GRAVITY: 9.81\nCannot reassign a constant variable.\n```",
