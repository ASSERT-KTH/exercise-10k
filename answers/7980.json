  "answer": "**Calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n=====================================================\n\nThe GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n-----------------------\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = 48\nnum2 = 18\ngcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n```\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n\t* `a, b = b, a % b`: Swap the values of `a` and `b`, and calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n\t* The loop continues until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The final value of `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n4. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nRunning the program with `num1 = 48` and `num2 = 18` will output:\n```\nThe GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6\n```",
