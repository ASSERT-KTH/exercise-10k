  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n    point1 (list): Coordinates of the first point (e.g., [x, y] or [x, y, z])\n    point2 (list): Coordinates of the second point (e.g., [x, y] or [x, y, z])\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    squared_diffs = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n    return math.sqrt(sum(squared_diffs))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1 = [1, 2]  # 2D point\n    point2 = [4, 6]\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\n    point1 = [1, 2, 3]  # 3D point\n    point2 = [4, 5, 6]\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two points as input, each represented as a list of coordinates.\n2. It checks if both points have the same number of dimensions. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n4. It returns the square root of the sum of these squared differences, which represents the Euclidean distance between the two points.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with example points in 2D and 3D spaces.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space: `calculate_distance([1, 2], [4, 6])`\n* Calculate the distance between two points in a 3D space: `calculate_distance([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`",
