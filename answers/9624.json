  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name and age as arguments, with age defaulting to 25 if not provided.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that takes a name and age as arguments with a default age value. This function will allow you to print out a greeting message with the provided name and age. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function named 'greet' with two parameters: 'name' and 'age'. \n# The 'age' parameter has a default value of 25.\ndef greet(name, age=25):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a greeting message with the provided name and age.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The person's name.\n        age (int, optional): The person's age. Defaults to 25.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Print out a greeting message that includes the name and age.\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n\n# Example usage:\ngreet(\"John\")  # Outputs: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.\ngreet(\"Alice\", 30)  # Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `greet` function is defined with two parameters: `name` and `age`. The `age` parameter has a default value of 25, which is used if no age is provided when calling the function.\n* Inside the `greet` function, a greeting message is printed out using an f-string, which allows for embedding expressions inside string literals. The message includes the provided `name` and `age`.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of what the function does, as well as information about its parameters.\n* Example usage of the `greet` function is provided to demonstrate how to call the function with and without providing an age.",
