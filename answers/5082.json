Can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the mathematical operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operator is valid\n    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Must be one of '+', '-', '*', '/'.\")\n\n    # Perform the mathematical operation\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operator from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the mathematical operation\n        result = math_operation(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `math_operation` that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding mathematical operation. The `main` function gets the numbers and operator from the user, calls `math_operation`, and prints the result. The program also includes error handling for invalid operators and division by zero.",
