  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 is 'A', score >= 80 is 'B', score >= 70 is 'C', score >= 60 is 'D', and score < 60 is 'F'",
  "answer": "Based on the detailed specification you provided, here is the code that meets all the requirements:\n```\ndef grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\nprint(\"Your grade is: \", grade(score))\n```\nThis code defines the `grade` function, which takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the conditions specified. The code then takes an integer score as input from the user, calls the `grade` function with the input score, and prints the result to the console.",
