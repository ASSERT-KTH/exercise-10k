  "answer": "**Function to Generate Prime Numbers**\n======================================\n\nThe following function generates all prime numbers up to a given input number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_prime_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all prime numbers up to n.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The upper limit for generating prime numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of prime numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)\n    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n\n    # Iterate from 2 to sqrt(n)\n    for current_prime in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if sieve[current_prime]:\n            # Mark multiples of current_prime as not prime\n            for multiple in range(current_prime**2, n + 1, current_prime):\n                sieve[multiple] = False\n\n    # Return a list of all prime numbers in the range\n    return [num for num, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 50\n    prime_numbers = get_prime_numbers(n)\n    print(f\"Prime numbers up to {n}: {prime_numbers}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers.\n\n1.  Initialize a boolean array `sieve` of size `n + 1`, where `sieve[i]` represents whether `i` is a prime number or not.\n2.  Set `sieve[0]` and `sieve[1]` to `False`, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.\n3.  Iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each prime number `current_prime` in this range:\n    *   If `current_prime` is a prime number (i.e., `sieve[current_prime]` is `True`), mark its multiples as not prime by setting `sieve[multiple]` to `False` for all multiples of `current_prime`.\n4.  Finally, return a list of all prime numbers in the range by iterating over the `sieve` array and including the indices of the elements that are still set to `True`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log log n), making it efficient for generating prime numbers up to large numbers.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor an input of `n = 50`, the function will output:\n\n```\nPrime numbers up to 50: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]\n```",
