  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score 90-100 is A, 80-89 is B, 70-79 is C, 60-69 is D, and below 60 is F.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"Function to calculate the grade based on the score.\"\"\"\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to get the score from the user and print the grade.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        score = float(input(\"Enter your exam score: \"))\n        if score < 0 or score > 100:\n            print(\"Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100.\")\n        else:\n            grade = calculate_grade(score)\n            print(f\"Your grade is: {grade}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Function `calculate_grade(score)`**: This function takes the exam score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n2. **Function `main()`**: This function gets the exam score from the user, checks if the score is valid (between 0 and 100), calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade(score)` function, and prints the grade.\n3. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling to ensure that the user enters a valid score. If the user enters an invalid score (e.g., a string or a score outside the range of 0 to 100), the program prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a score of 85, the program will output: \"Your grade is: B\"\n* If the user enters a score of 92, the program will output: \"Your grade is: A\"\n* If the user enters a score of 58, the program will output: \"Your grade is: F\"\n* If the user enters an invalid score (e.g., \"abc\"), the program will output: \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.\"",
