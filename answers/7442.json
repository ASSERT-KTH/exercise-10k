  "prompt": "Implement an optimized version of the Bubble Sort algorithm that can sort a list of integers in ascending order. The optimization should include stopping the algorithm if no swaps are made in a pass, indicating that the list is already sorted.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm with the specified optimization:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(A):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        A (list): A list of integers to be sorted.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(A)\n    \n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        \n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            \n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if A[j] > A[j + 1]:\n                A[j], A[j + 1] = A[j + 1], A[j]\n                \n    return A\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\nNote that this implementation does not include the optimization mentioned in the specification. To implement the optimization, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(A):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        A (list): A list of integers to be sorted.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(A)\n    swapped = True\n    \n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    while swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n - 1):\n            if A[j] > A[j + 1]:\n                A[j], A[j + 1] = A[j + 1], A[j]\n                swapped = True\n        n -= 1\n                \n    return A\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\nThis modified version of the code includes the optimization by introducing a `swapped` flag that is set to `True` whenever a swap is made. If no swaps are made in a pass (i.e., `swapped` remains `False`), the algorithm terminates early.",
