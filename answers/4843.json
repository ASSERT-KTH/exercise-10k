  "answer": "**Array Intersection Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two arrays as input and returns their intersection. The intersection of two arrays is a new array that contains only the elements that are common to both arrays.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef array_intersection(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the intersection of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    intersection = array_intersection(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `array_intersection` function takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input.\n2. It converts the input arrays to sets using the `set()` function.\n3. It uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets.\n4. It converts the resulting set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The function returns the intersection list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nIntersection: [4, 5]\n```\n\nNote: The order of elements in the intersection list may not be the same as their order in the original arrays, since sets are unordered in Python. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension with an `if` condition to filter out elements that are not common to both arrays.",
