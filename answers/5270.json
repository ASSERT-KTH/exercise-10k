  "answer": "**BMI Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): Weight in kilograms\n        height (float): Height in meters\n\n    Returns:\n        float: BMI value\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef classify_bmi(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classifies the BMI into different categories using conditional statements.\n\n    Args:\n        bmi (float): BMI value\n\n    Returns:\n        str: BMI classification\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal weight\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kilograms: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n    # Classify BMI\n    classification = classify_bmi(bmi)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your BMI classification is: {classification}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_bmi` function calculates the BMI using the formula `BMI = weight / height^2`.\n2. The `classify_bmi` function uses conditional statements to classify the BMI into different categories:\n\t* Underweight: BMI < 18.5\n\t* Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25\n\t* Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30\n\t* Obese: BMI >= 30\n3. The `main` function gets user input for weight and height, calculates the BMI, classifies the BMI, and prints the results.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter weight: 70 kg, height: 1.75 m\n\t+ Output: Your BMI is: 22.86, Your BMI classification is: Normal weight\n* Enter weight: 90 kg, height: 1.75 m\n\t+ Output: Your BMI is: 29.39, Your BMI classification is: Overweight\n* Enter weight: 40 kg, height: 1.60 m\n\t+ Output: Your BMI is: 15.63, Your BMI classification is: Underweight\n\nNote: This program uses a simple classification system and does not take into account other factors that may affect BMI, such as age, sex, and muscle mass.",
