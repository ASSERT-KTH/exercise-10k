  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints all prime numbers up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef print_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"Prints all prime numbers up to n.\"\"\"\n    for num in range(2, n + 1):\n        is_prime = True\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            print(num)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_primes(100)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We define a function `print_primes(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints all prime numbers up to `n`.\n*   We use a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   For each number, we assume it's prime (`is_prime = True`) and then check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.\n*   If the number is divisible by any of these values, we set `is_prime` to `False` and break the loop.\n*   If `is_prime` remains `True` after the loop, we print the number as it's prime.\n\n### Optimizations:\n\n*   We start checking divisibility from 2, as 1 is not a prime number.\n*   We only check divisibility up to the square root of the number, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(n \\* sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because we have a nested loop structure, with the outer loop running in O(n) time and the inner loop running in O(sqrt(n)) time.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   `print_primes(10)` will print all prime numbers up to 10, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n*   `print_primes(20)` will print all prime numbers up to 20, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nNote that this program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to moderate-sized inputs. For larger inputs, more efficient algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
