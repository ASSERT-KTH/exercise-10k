  "prompt": "Create a function named 'calculate' that takes in two numbers and an operator as arguments, then performs the corresponding mathematical operation. The operator can be one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/'. If the operator is '/' and the second number is zero, the function should return an error message.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic mathematical operations based on the provided operator, handling potential division-by-zero errors. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs basic mathematical operations on two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The mathematical operator. It can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the mathematical operation.\n        str: An error message if the operator is '/' and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the operator is valid\n    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        return \"Error: Invalid operator\"\n\n    # Then, we check if the operator is '/' and the second number is zero\n    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:\n        # If so, we return an error message\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n\n    # If the operator is '+', we perform addition\n    if operator == '+':\n        # We use the built-in '+' operator to add the numbers\n        result = num1 + num2\n        return result\n\n    # If the operator is '-', we perform subtraction\n    elif operator == '-':\n        # We use the built-in '-' operator to subtract the numbers\n        result = num1 - num2\n        return result\n\n    # If the operator is '*', we perform multiplication\n    elif operator == '*':\n        # We use the built-in '*' operator to multiply the numbers\n        result = num1 * num2\n        return result\n\n    # If the operator is '/', we perform division\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # We use the built-in '/' operator to divide the numbers\n        result = num1 / num2\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculate(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\nprint(calculate(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\nprint(calculate(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\nprint(calculate(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\nprint(calculate(10, 0, '/'))  # Output: Error: Division by zero\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate` first checks if the `operator` is valid. If not, it returns an error message indicating an invalid operator.\n* It then checks for the division-by-zero case when the `operator` is '/' and the second number `num2` is zero, returning an appropriate error message if true.\n* For valid operators and numbers, it performs the corresponding mathematical operation using the built-in operators '+' , '-' , '*' , '/' and returns the `result`.\n* The function includes example usage to demonstrate its functionality with different operators and inputs.",
