  "answer": "**Reversing a List of Numbers**\n================================\n\nHere's an example program written in Python that uses slicing to reverse a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The reversed list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return numbers[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Reversed List:\", reverse_list(numbers))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `reverse_list` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   It uses Python's slice notation `numbers[::-1]` to create a new list that contains the elements of the original list in reverse order.\n*   The `[::-1]` slice means \"start at the end of the list and end at position 0, move with the step -1\" which effectively reverses the list.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nIf you want to reverse the list in-place (i.e., modify the original list), you can use the `reverse()` method:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list_in_place(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses a given list of numbers in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    numbers.reverse()\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nreverse_list_in_place(numbers)\nprint(\"Reversed List:\", numbers)\n```\n\nNote that the `reverse()` method modifies the original list, whereas the slicing approach creates a new list. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.",
