  "answer": "Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bitwise_operations(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform basic bitwise operations on two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the results of the bitwise AND and OR operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform bitwise AND operation\n    and_result = a & b\n    \n    # Perform bitwise OR operation\n    or_result = a | b\n\n    return {\n        \"Bitwise AND\": and_result,\n        \"Bitwise OR\": or_result,\n    }\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    a = 5   # 101 in binary\n    b = 3   # 011 in binary\n\n    results = bitwise_operations(a, b)\n\n    print(\"Results:\")\n    for operation, result in results.items():\n        print(f\"{operation}: {result} ({bin(result)[2:]} in binary)\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `bitwise_operations` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n*   We perform the bitwise AND operation using the `&` operator and store the result in `and_result`.\n*   We perform the bitwise OR operation using the `|` operator and store the result in `or_result`.\n*   We return a dictionary containing the results of both operations.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to call the `bitwise_operations` function with two integers `a` and `b`, and print the results along with their binary representations.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the results of the bitwise AND and OR operations on the given integers, along with their binary representations.",
