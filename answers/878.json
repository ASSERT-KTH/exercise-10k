  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a game of hangman. The program should take in the word and output the updated word based on the following conditions: if the user guesses a letter, reveal the letter in the word, if the user guesses incorrectly, draw a part of the hangman's gallows, if the user wins or loses, output the result.",
  "answer": "**Hangman Game Simulation**\n================================\n\n### Game Overview\n\nThis program simulates a game of hangman. The user is prompted to guess letters, and the program updates the word accordingly. If the user guesses a letter correctly, the letter is revealed in the word. If the user guesses incorrectly, a part of the hangman's gallows is drawn. The game ends when the user wins or loses.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nHANGMAN_PICS = ['''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n /    |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n / \\  |\n      |\n=========''']\n\nWORDS = 'ant baboon badger bat bear beaver camel cat clam cobra cougar coyote crow deer dog donkey duck eagle ferret fox frog goat goose hawk lion lizard llama mole monkey moose mouse mule newt otter owl panda parrot pigeon python rabbit ram rat raven rhino salmon seal shark sheep skunk sloth snake spider stork swan tiger toad trout turkey turtle weasel whale wolf wombat zebra'.split()\n\ndef getRandomWord(wordList):\n    # This function returns a random string from the passed list of strings.\n    wordIndex = random.randint(0, len(wordList) - 1)\n    return wordList[wordIndex]\n\ndef displayBoard(HANGMAN_PICS, missedLetters, correctLetters, secretWord):\n    print(HANGMAN_PICS[len(missedLetters)])\n    print()\n\n    print('Missed letters:', end=' ')\n    for letter in missedLetters:\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\n    blanks = '_' * len(secretWord)\n\n    for i in range(len(secretWord)): # replace blanks with correctly guessed letters\n        if secretWord[i] in correctLetters:\n            blanks = blanks[:i] + secretWord[i] + blanks[i+1:]\n\n    for letter in blanks: # show the secret word with spaces in between each letter\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\ndef getGuess(alreadyGuessed):\n    # Returns the letter the player entered.
