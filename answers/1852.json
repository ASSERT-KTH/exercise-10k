  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef diff(list1, list2):\n    res = []\n    for i in list1:\n        if i not in list2:\n            res.append(i)\n    return res\n\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(diff(list1, list2))\n```\nThis code defines a function `diff` that takes two lists as input, iterates over the first list, and checks if each element is in the second list. If an element is not in the second list, it is appended to the `res` list. Finally, the `res` list is returned. The code then defines two lists `list1` and `list2` and calls the `diff` function with these lists as arguments, printing the result. The output of this code will be `[1, 2, 3]`.",
