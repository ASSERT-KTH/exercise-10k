  "answer": "Recursive Arithmetic Operations\n================================\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that calculates the result of recursive arithmetic operations, specifically the factorial and Fibonacci sequence.\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number n.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The position of the Fibonacci number to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The nth Fibonacci number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Input should be a positive integer\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num = 5\n\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}\")\n    print(f\"The {num}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(num)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExplanation\n------------\n\n1.  **Factorial Function:**\n    *   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n    *   The base case is when `n` equals 0, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 is defined as 1).\n    *   For other values of `n`, the function calls itself recursively with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.\n2.  **Fibonacci Function:**\n    *   The `fibonacci` function calculates the nth Fibonacci number.\n    *   It first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0 and returns an error message if true.\n    *   The base cases are when `n` equals 1 or 2, in which case the function returns 0 or 1, respectively (since the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1).\n    *   For other values of `n`, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2` and returns the sum of these two calls.\n3.  **Main Function:**\n    *   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `factorial` and `fibonacci` functions by calculating the factorial and nth Fibonacci number for a given input number (`num`).\n\nAdvice\n-------\n\n*   Be cautious when using recursive functions, as they can lead to stack overflow errors for large input values due to the repeated function calls.\n*   Consider using iterative approaches or memoization techniques to optimize performance for larger inputs.",
