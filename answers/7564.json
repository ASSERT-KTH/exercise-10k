  "answer": "Of course! I'll provide a comprehensive response to help you create a function that utilizes type hints for specifying the expected types of its parameters and return value. This will include a brief action plan and an explanation of the code. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a name as input and returns a greeting message.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A greeting message.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we want to check if the input is indeed a string\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"The name must be a string.\")\n\n    # Now, we can create the greeting message\n    # We use an f-string to insert the name into the message\n    greeting_message = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Finally, we return the greeting message\n    return greeting_message\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `greet` is defined with a parameter `name` of type `str` and a return type of `str`. This is achieved using type hints, which provide a way to specify the expected types of function parameters and return values.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed to ensure that the input `name` is indeed a string using the `isinstance` function. If not, a `TypeError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* An f-string is used to create a greeting message by inserting the `name` into the string. This allows for a concise and readable way to format the message.\n* Finally, the greeting message is returned by the function, which can then be printed or used as needed.",
