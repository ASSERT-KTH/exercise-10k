  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a character to strip as input and returns the string with the character stripped from the start and end.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfunction strip_char(s, ch):\n    \"\"\"\n    Strips the specified character from the start and end of the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove leading occurrences of the character\n    s = s.lstrip(ch)\n    \n    # Remove trailing occurrences of the character\n    s = s.rstrip(ch)\n    \n    return s\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(strip_char(\"xyxHello Worldxxy\", 'x'))  # Output: \"xyHello World\"\n```\nNote that I've used the `lstrip` and `rstrip` methods of the string object in Python to remove the leading and trailing occurrences of the character, respectively. This is a more concise and efficient way to achieve the desired result compared to using loops or manual string manipulation.",
