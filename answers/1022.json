  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides a hint whether the guess is higher or lower than the generated number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. You will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. You will receive a hint whether your guess is higher or lower than the generated number.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. To quit the game, type \"quit\" at any time.\n\n**Notes**\n-----\n\n* The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n* The user's guess is checked against the generated number, and a hint is provided accordingly.\n* The program keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.\n* The user can quit the game at any time by typing \"quit\".",
