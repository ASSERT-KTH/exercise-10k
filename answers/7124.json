  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers given as input. The program should take a list of numbers as input, add them up, and then divide by the total count of numbers to find the average.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter the number of values: \"))\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(num):\n        val = float(input(\"Enter value #{}: \".format(i+1)))\n        sum += val\n    avg = sum / num\n    print(\"The average is:\", avg)\n\nmain()\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It defines a `main` function that contains the program's logic.\n2. It prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to calculate the average for.\n3. It initializes a `sum` variable to 0 and uses a `for` loop to iterate `num` times.\n4. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter a value and adds it to the `sum` variable.\n5. After the loop, it calculates the average by dividing the `sum` variable by the number of values.\n6. It prints the result using `print`.\n7. Finally, it calls the `main` function to execute the program.\n\nNote that I used `float` to read the input values, as the specification doesn't specify whether the numbers should be integers or floating-point numbers. If you want to restrict the input to integers, you can replace `float` with `int`.",
