The `dijkstra` function calculates the shortest distances from a given start vertex to all other vertices in the graph. The `find_shortest_path` function uses the `dijkstra` function to find the shortest path between two vertices.\n\nThe graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a vertex and each value is a dictionary of its neighbors and their distances.\n\nThe `dijkstra` function uses a priority queue to efficiently process the vertices. It maintains a dictionary of shortest distances and updates it as it processes the vertices.\n\nThe `find_shortest_path` function uses the `dijkstra` function to find the shortest distances from the start vertex to all other vertices. It then builds the shortest path by backtracking from the end vertex to the start vertex.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `dijkstra` and `find_shortest_path` functions to find the shortest distances and path between two vertices in a sample graph.",
