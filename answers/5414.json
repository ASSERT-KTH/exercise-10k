  "prompt": "Write a function called 'absolute_difference' that calculates the absolute difference between two given numbers.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function to calculate the absolute difference between two given numbers. This response will guide you through the implementation of this function. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef absolute_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the absolute difference between two given numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int or float): The first number.\n        num2 (int or float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to ensure that both inputs are numbers\n    if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be numbers\")\n\n    # Now, we can calculate the absolute difference using the built-in abs function\n    # The abs function returns the absolute value of a number\n    # We subtract num2 from num1 to get the difference, then pass it to the abs function\n    difference = abs(num1 - num2)\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated difference\n    return difference\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `absolute_difference` takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and first checks if both are numbers using `isinstance`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It calculates the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` using the built-in `abs` function, which returns the absolute value of the difference.\n* The result is then returned by the function.\n* Note that this function works with both integers and floating-point numbers, and it correctly handles cases where `num1` is greater than, less than, or equal to `num2`.",
