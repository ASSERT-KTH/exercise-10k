  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two integers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the operation and returns the result. The program should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the operation is not one of these four, the program should return an error message. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, the program should also return an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        print(\"The result of\", num1, \"+\", num2, \"is\", num1 + num2)\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        print(\"The result of\", num1, \"-\", num2, \"is\", num1 - num2)\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        print(\"The result of\", num1, \"*\", num2, \"is\", num1 * num2)\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The result of\", num1, \"/\", num2, \"is\", num1 / num2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've followed the specifications carefully and implemented the program as described. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
