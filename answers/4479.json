  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the sum of squares of elements in a list that meet a specific condition. In this example, the condition is that the number should be greater than 3.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of elements in a list that meet a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True or False.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of elements that meet the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if condition(num):\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ncondition = lambda x: x > 3\n\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers, condition)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of numbers greater than 3:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `sum_of_squares` that takes a list of numbers and a condition function as arguments.\n*   Inside the function, we initialize a variable `sum_squares` to 0, which will store the sum of squares.\n*   We use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list.\n*   For each number, we check if it meets the condition by calling the condition function with the number as an argument. If the condition is met (i.e., the function returns True), we add the square of the number to `sum_squares`.\n*   Finally, we return the calculated sum of squares.\n\nYou can modify the `condition` function to apply different conditions. In the example usage, we use a lambda function to check if a number is greater than 3.",
