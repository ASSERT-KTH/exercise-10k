  "answer": "**Bank Account Manager Program**\n====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program simulates a basic bank account manager. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, or check their balance, and prints the result.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"Deposit a specified amount into the account.\"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"Withdraw a specified amount from the account.\"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"Print the current account balance.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Manager\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Select an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter a positive amount to deposit into the account.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter a positive amount to withdraw from the account.\n\t* Check Balance: Print the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. The program will print the result of your chosen action.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not persist data between sessions. In a real-world application, you would likely want to use a more robust interface and store data in a database or file.",
