  "answer": "Here's a Python program that creates a dictionary of words and their definitions, and allows users to add, remove, update, and search for words in the dictionary.\n\n```python\nclass Dictionary:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.words = {}\n\n    def add_word(self, word, definition):\n        \"\"\"Add a word to the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if word not in self.words:\n            self.words[word] = definition\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' added successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' already exists in the dictionary.\")\n\n    def remove_word(self, word):\n        \"\"\"Remove a word from the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if word in self.words:\n            del self.words[word]\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n    def update_word(self, word, new_definition):\n        \"\"\"Update the definition of a word in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if word in self.words:\n            self.words[word] = new_definition\n            print(f\"Definition of word '{word}' updated successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n    def search_word(self, word):\n        \"\"\"Search for a word in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if word in self.words:\n            print(f\"Definition of '{word}': {self.words[word]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Word '{word}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n    def display_dictionary(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all words and their definitions in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if not self.words:\n            print(\"Dictionary is empty.\")\n        else:\n            for word, definition in self.words.items():\n                print(f\"{word}: {definition}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    dictionary = Dictionary()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nDictionary Manager\")\n        print(\"1.

Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            word = input(\"Enter the word: \")\n            definition = input(\"Enter the definition: \")\n            dictionary.add_word(word, definition)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            word = input(\"Enter the word to remove: \")\n            dictionary.remove_word(word)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            word = input(\"Enter the word to update: \")\n            new_definition = input(\"Enter the new definition: \")\n            dictionary.update_word(word, new_definition)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            word = input(\"Enter the word to search: \")\n            dictionary.search_word(word)\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            dictionary.display_dictionary()\n        elif choice == \"6\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n1. **Adding a word**: Select option 1, enter the word and its definition, and the word will be added to the dictionary.\n2. **Removing a word**: Select option 2, enter the word to remove, and the word will be removed from the dictionary if it exists.\n3. **Updating a word**: Select option 3, enter the word to update and its new definition, and the word's definition will be updated in the dictionary.\n4. **Searching for a word**: Select option 4, enter the word to search, and the dictionary will display the word's definition if it exists.\n5. **Displaying the dictionary**: Select option 5, and the dictionary will display all words and their definitions.\n\n### Note:\n\n* The dictionary is stored in memory and will be lost when the program terminates. To persist the dictionary, consider storing it in a file or database.\n* The program does not handle duplicate words or definitions. If you need to handle these cases, consider adding additional logic to the `add_word` method.",
