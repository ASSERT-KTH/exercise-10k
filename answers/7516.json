  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game**\n======================\n\nHere's a simple implementation of a Word Scramble game in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, scrambles it, and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\", \"fig\", \"grape\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles a given word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Plays the Word Scramble game.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    if answer.lower() == word:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {word}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Scramble game!\")\n    while True:\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Would you like to play again? (yes/no): \")\n        if play_again.lower() != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `words` list contains a collection of words to be used in the game.\n2. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it into a list of characters, shuffles the list, and joins it back into a string.\n3. The `play_game` function selects a random word, scrambles it, asks the user to unscramble it, and checks if the user's answer is correct.\n4. The `main` function serves as the game's entry point. It welcomes the user, enters a loop where it repeatedly plays the game, and asks the user if they want to play again after each round.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo run the game, simply execute the script. You will be presented with a scrambled word and prompted to unscramble it. Enter your answer, and the game will tell you whether you're correct or not. You will be asked if you want to play again after each round.",
