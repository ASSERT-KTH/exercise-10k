  "prompt": "Write a program that converts the string '10' to an integer and then prints the result. Print the result to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\n# Define the string to be converted\nstring_to_convert = '10'\n\n# Convert the string to an integer\ninteger_result = int(string_to_convert)\n\n# Print the result to the console\nprint(integer_result)\n```\n\nTo run this program, you would save it in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `convert_string.py`), and then run it with a Python interpreter (for example, `python convert_string.py` in the terminal). The program will print `10` to the console.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more concise version of the program:\n\n```python\nprint(int('10'))\n```\n\nThis will achieve the same result as the previous program, but in a single line of code.",
