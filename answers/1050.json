  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a predicate as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def filter_list(self, input_list, predicate):\n        # Your code here\n        return [element for element in input_list if predicate(element)]\n\n# Example usage\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven_numbers = Solution().filter_list(numbers, is_even)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Solution` class with a `filter_list` method that takes a list and a predicate as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate. The example usage demonstrates how to use this method to filter a list of numbers and get only the even numbers.",
