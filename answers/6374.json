  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef combine_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines two lists into a new list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to combine.\n        list2 (list): The second list to combine.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list1 + list2\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\ncombined_list = combine_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `combine_lists` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two input lists and returns the resulting list. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function to combine two lists and print the result.",
