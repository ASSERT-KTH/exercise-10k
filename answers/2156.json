  "answer": "**File Reader Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that reads a text file and prints out its contents.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef read_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a text file and prints out its contents.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to read.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n            contents = file.read()\n            print(contents)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n\ndef main():\n    filename = input(\"Enter the filename: \")\n    read_file(filename)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `read_file` function takes a `filename` as input and attempts to open the file in read mode (`'r'`).\n2. If the file is found, its contents are read using the `read()` method and printed to the console.\n3. If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` exception is caught and an error message is printed.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a filename and calls the `read_file` function with the provided filename.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `file_reader.py`.\n2. Create a text file named `example.txt` with some sample content.\n3. Run the program using `python file_reader.py`.\n4. When prompted, enter the filename `example.txt`.\n5. The program will print out the contents of the `example.txt` file.\n\nNote: Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the Python script, or provide the full path to the file when prompted.",
