  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operations to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operation (str): The arithmetic operation to be performed. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the operation is not supported.\n    ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is 'divide' and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation strings to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is supported\n    if operation not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    result = operations[operation](num1, num2)\n\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if operation == 'divide' and num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the operation and print the result\n        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        # Print any error messages\n        print(str(e))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a dictionary to map operation strings to their corresponding functions, making it easy to add or remove operations in the future. It also includes error checking to handle unsupported operations and division by zero. The `main` function gets user input, performs the operation, and prints the result or any error messages.",
