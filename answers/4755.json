  "answer": "**Square Root Calculator Program**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the square root of a given number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the square root of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The number to calculate the square root of.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square root of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number\")\n    return math.sqrt(number)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    number = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    try:\n        square_root = calculate_square_root(number)\n        print(f\"The square root of {number} is {square_root}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_square_root` that takes a number as input and returns its square root.\n2. The function checks if the input number is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is, since the square root of a negative number is undefined in real mathematics.\n3. The function uses the `math.sqrt` function from the Python `math` library to calculate the square root of the input number.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_square_root` function by taking a number as input from the user, calculating its square root, and printing the result.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `square_root.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python square_root.py`). When prompted, enter a number, and the program will print its square root. For example:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 16\nThe square root of 16.0 is 4.0\n```",
