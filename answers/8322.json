  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, using both a for loop and a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int i;\n\n    // Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using for loop\n    printf(\"Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using for loop:\\n\");\n    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    // Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop\n    printf(\"Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop:\\n\");\n    i = 1;\n    while (i <= 10) {\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\n        i++;\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    // Printing numbers from 10 to 1 using for loop\n    printf(\"Printing numbers from 10 to 1 using for loop:\\n\");\n    i = 10;\n    for (; i > 0; i--) {\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    // Printing numbers from 10 to 1 using while loop\n    printf(\"Printing numbers from 10 to 1 using while loop:\\n\");\n    i = 10;\n    while (i > 0) {\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\n        i--;\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `stdio.h` library, defines the `main` function, and uses the specified loops to print the numbers from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1. The output will be as described in the specification.",
