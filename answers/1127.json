  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula. The formula is defined as a function `f(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the next number in the sequence.\n\n**Program Code**\n---------------\n\n```python\ndef sequence_generator(formula, start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.\n\n    Args:\n    - formula (function): A function that takes an integer as input and returns the next number in the sequence.\n    - start (int): The starting number of the sequence.\n    - end (int): The ending number of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    - list: A list of numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    current = start\n    while current <= end:\n        sequence.append(current)\n        current = formula(current)\n    return sequence\n\n# Example formula: f(n) = 2n + 1\ndef example_formula(n):\n    return 2 * n + 1\n\n# Generate the sequence\nsequence = sequence_generator(example_formula, 1, 10)\nprint(sequence)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n------------------------\n\n1. The `sequence_generator` function takes three arguments: `formula`, `start`, and `end`.\n2. The `formula` argument is a function that defines the sequence.\n3. The `start` argument is the starting number of the sequence.\n4. The `end` argument is the ending number of the sequence.\n5. The function initializes an empty list `sequence` to store the numbers in the sequence.\n6. The function starts with the `start` number and applies the `formula` function to generate the next number in the sequence.\n7. The function continues generating numbers until it reaches the `end` number.\n8. The function returns the list of numbers in the sequence.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers: `f(n) = n + f(n-1) + f(n-2)`\n* Generate a sequence of prime numbers: `f(n) = n + 1` if `n` is prime, otherwise `f(n) = n + 2`\n* Generate a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula: `f(n) = 2 * f(n-1) + 1`\n\nNote: This program uses a simple iterative approach to generate the sequence. For more complex formulas or larger sequences, a recursive approach or a more efficient algorithm may be necessary.",
