  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and returns its surface area.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number.\")\n\n    # The surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one face\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is {surface_area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `calculate_surface_area` that takes the side length of a cube as input and returns its surface area. The surface area of a cube is calculated using the formula `6 * (side_length ** 2)`, which is derived from the fact that a cube has 6 faces, each with an area of `side_length ** 2`.\n\nThe `main` function asks the user to input the side length of the cube, calls the `calculate_surface_area` function with the input side length, and then prints the calculated surface area. If the input side length is not a positive number, the program raises a `ValueError` with an error message.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `cube_surface_area.py`) and run it from the command line by typing `python cube_surface_area.py`. Then, follow the prompt to enter the side length of the cube.",
