  "answer": "### Least Common Value in a Dictionary\n\nThe following Python function takes a dictionary as input and returns the key with the least common value.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef least_common_value(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the key with the least common value in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        d (dict): Input dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the key and its corresponding value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the occurrences of each value\n    value_counts = Counter(d.values())\n\n    # Find the minimum count\n    min_count = min(value_counts.values())\n\n    # Find the keys with the minimum count\n    least_common_keys = [key for key, value in d.items() if value_counts[value] == min_count]\n\n    # Return the first key with the least common value\n    return least_common_keys[0], d[least_common_keys[0]]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 3, 'e': 2, 'f': 4}\n    key, value = least_common_value(d)\n    print(f\"The key with the least common value is: {key} with value {value}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  The function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each value in the dictionary.\n2.  It then finds the minimum count, which corresponds to the least common value.\n3.  The function identifies all keys with the minimum count and returns the first one along with its corresponding value.\n\n#### Note\n\n*   If there are multiple keys with the same least common value, this function returns the first one it encounters. If you need to return all keys with the least common value, you can modify the function to return the `least_common_keys` list instead.",
