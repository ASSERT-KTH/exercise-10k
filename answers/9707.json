  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades. The function should calculate the average grade and then return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their grades along with a message indicating whether they passed or failed based on a threshold of 50. If the grade is above or equal to 50, the message should be 'Passed', otherwise it should be 'Failed'",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade of students and returns a dictionary with their grades and pass/fail status. This function will take into account a threshold of 50 to determine whether each student passed or failed. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade of students and returns a new dictionary \n    with the student names as keys and their grades along with a message indicating whether \n    they passed or failed based on a threshold of 50.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with the student names as keys and their grades along with a message indicating whether they passed or failed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input dictionary is empty\n    if not grades_dict:\n        return {}\n\n    # Then, we initialize an empty dictionary to store the results\n    result_dict = {}\n\n    # We also initialize a variable to store the sum of all grades\n    total_grades = 0\n\n    # Then, we iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():\n        # For each student, we add their grade to the total sum of grades\n        total_grades += grade\n\n        # We then check if the grade is above or equal to 50\n        if grade >= 50:\n            # If it is, we append 'Passed' to the result dictionary\n            result_dict[student] = {'Grade': grade, 'Status': 'Passed'}\n        else:\n            # If not, we append 'Failed' to the result dictionary\n            result_dict[student] = {'Grade': grade, 'Status': 'Failed'}\n\n    # After iterating over all students, we calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = total_grades / len(grades_dict)\n\n    # We print the average grade\n    print(f\"The average grade is: {average_grade}\")\n\n    # Finally, we return the result dictionary\n    return result_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    'John': 60,\n    'Alice': 40,\n    'Bob': 70,\n    'Eve': 30\n}\n\nresult = calculate_average_grade(grades)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_average_grade` takes a dictionary `grades_dict` as input, where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades. It first checks if the input dictionary is empty and returns an empty dictionary if it is.\n*   It then iterates over each student and their grade in the input dictionary, adding their grade to the total sum of grades `total_grades`. For each student, it checks if the grade is above or equal to 50 and appends 'Passed' or 'Failed' to the `result_dict` accordingly.\n*   After iterating over all students, it calculates the average grade by dividing the total sum of grades by the number of students and prints the average grade.\n*   Finally, it returns the `result_dict`, which contains the student names as keys and their grades along with a message indicating whether they passed or failed.",
