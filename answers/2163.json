  "answer": "**Division with Remainder Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their division result with remainder.\n\n```python\ndef divide_with_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs division and returns the quotient and remainder.\n    \n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for two numbers\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend (number being divided): \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor (number by which we are dividing): \"))\n\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return\n\n    # Perform division and print the result\n    quotient, remainder = divide_with_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the dividend (number being divided) when prompted.\n3. Enter the divisor (number by which we are dividing) when prompted.\n4. The program will print the division result with remainder.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nEnter the dividend (number being divided): 17\nEnter the divisor (number by which we are dividing): 5\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2.\n```",
