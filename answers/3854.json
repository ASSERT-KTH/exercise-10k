  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Game**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that simulates a game of rock paper scissors between a user and the computer. The game continues until the user chooses to quit.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        \n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\")\n        \n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        \n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (y/n): \")\n        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter y for yes or n for no: \").lower()\n\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. The `main` function contains the game loop, where the user is prompted to enter their choice and play again.\n4. The program checks for invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter a valid choice.\n5. The game continues until the user chooses to quit.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
