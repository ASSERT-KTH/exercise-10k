  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The program should take a string as input from the user and print out whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\ndef isPalindrome(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ns = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\nif isPalindrome(s):\n    print(s + \" is a palindrome.\")\nelse:\n    print(s + \" is not a palindrome.\")\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
