  "answer": "**Sum of Squares Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and calculates the sum of their squares.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of squares of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 ** 2 + num2 ** 2\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    result = sum_of_squares(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_of_squares` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum of squares.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates the sum of their squares using the `sum_of_squares` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program and enter two numbers when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 3\nEnter the second number: 4\nThe sum of squares of 3.0 and 4.0 is: 25.0\n```\n\nNote: This program uses Python 3.x syntax and is designed to be run in a Python environment.",
