  "answer": "**Greeting Program**\n======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a name as input from the user and prints out a greeting message.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting message with the given name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their name and prints a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print_greeting(name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_greeting` function takes a `name` as input and prints a greeting message using an f-string.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for their name using the `input` function and stores it in the `name` variable.\n3. The `main` function then calls the `print_greeting` function with the user's name.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\n$ python greeting.py\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John!\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file named `greeting.py` and run it using Python (e.g., `python greeting.py`). Follow the prompt to enter your name, and the program will print a greeting message.",
