  "answer": "### Rotating an Array to the Right\n#### Problem Description\nGiven an array of integers and a number k, rotate the array k times to the right.\n\n#### Solution\n```python\ndef rotate_array(nums, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates the input array to the right by k steps.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): The input array of integers.\n        k (int): The number of steps to rotate the array to the right.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the effective number of steps to rotate, in case k is larger than the length of the array\n    k = k % len(nums)\n    \n    # Use list slicing to rotate the array\n    return nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    k = 3\n    print(\"Original array:\", nums)\n    print(\"Rotated array:\", rotate_array(nums, k))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `rotate_array` takes in an array of integers `nums` and a number `k` as input.\n2. It calculates the effective number of steps to rotate by taking the modulus of `k` with the length of the array. This is to handle cases where `k` is larger than the length of the array.\n3. It uses list slicing to rotate the array. The expression `nums[-k:]` gets the last `k` elements of the array, and `nums[:-k]` gets all elements except the last `k` elements.\n4. The rotated array is then returned by concatenating the last `k` elements with the rest of the array.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because list slicing and concatenation operations in Python take linear time.\n\n#### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the solution creates a new list to store the rotated array.",
