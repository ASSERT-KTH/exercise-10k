  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism given its length, width, and height.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_volume(length, width, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the prism.\n        width (float): The width of the prism.\n        height (float): The height of the prism.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the prism.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = length * width * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dimensions from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the prism: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the prism: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the prism: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = calculate_volume(length, width, height)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The volume of the prism is: {volume}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_volume` function takes in the length, width, and height of the prism as arguments and returns the volume.\n*   The `main` function asks the user for the dimensions of the prism, calculates the volume using the `calculate_volume` function, and then prints the result.\n*   The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the length, width, and height of the prism are all 5, the volume would be 5 \\* 5 \\* 5 = 125.\n*   If the length, width, and height of the prism are 3, 4, and 5 respectively, the volume would be 3 \\* 4 \\* 5 = 60.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rectangular_prism.py`), then run it using Python (e.g., `python rectangular_prism.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the dimensions of the prism, and the program will print the calculated volume.",
