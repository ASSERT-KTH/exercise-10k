  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a student passed or failed based on their grade. The program should ask for the student's grade and then print 'Passed' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Failed' if the grade is below 50.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade():\n    # Ask for the student's grade\n    while True:\n        try:\n            grade = float(input(\"Please enter the student's grade: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Check if the grade is 50 or above\n    if grade >= 50:\n        print('Passed')\n    else:\n        print('Failed')\n\n# Call the function\ncheck_grade()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `check_grade` function asks the user for a grade and checks if it's a valid number. If not, it asks again until a valid number is entered.\n* The function then checks if the grade is 50 or above. If it is, it prints 'Passed'. Otherwise, it prints 'Failed'.\n* The program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid inputs and ensure the program doesn't crash.\n* The `float` function is used to convert the user's input into a number, allowing for decimal grades.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a grade of 60. The output should be 'Passed'.\n* Run the program and enter a grade of 40. The output should be 'Failed'.\n* Run the program and enter a non-numeric input, such as 'abc'. The program should ask for the input again until a valid number is entered.",
