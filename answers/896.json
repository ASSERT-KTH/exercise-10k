  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for a student's name and grades in multiple subjects, and prints out the student's average grade and a message indicating whether they passed or failed.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specification:\n```\n# Define a function to get student information\ndef get_student_info():\n    # Get student's name\n    name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n\n    # Get student's grades\n    grades = {}\n    while True:\n        subject = input(\"Enter subject name (or 'done' to finish): \")\n        if subject.lower() == 'done':\n            break\n        grade = float(input(\"Enter grade for {}: \".format(subject)))\n        grades[subject] = grade\n\n    return name, grades\n\n# Define a function to calculate the student's average grade\ndef get_average_grade(grades):\n    total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n    return average_grade\n\n# Define a function to determine if the student passed or failed\ndef did_student_pass(average_grade):\n    if average_grade >= 60:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Define a function to print the student's report\ndef print_report(name, average_grade, did_pass):\n    if did_pass:\n        print(\"{}'s average grade is {:.2f}.

It asks the user for a student's name and grades, calculates the average grade, determines whether the student passed or failed, and prints out the student's report.",
