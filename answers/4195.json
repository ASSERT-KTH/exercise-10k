The `income` argument is the user's income, and the `tax_bracket` argument is a dictionary containing the tax brackets and corresponding tax rates.\n\nThe function iterates over the tax brackets and calculates the tax for each bracket. If the income is within a bracket, it calculates the tax for that bracket. If the income exceeds a bracket, it calculates the tax for the entire bracket.\n\nThe function returns the calculated tax.\n\nNote: This function assumes a progressive tax system, where the tax rate increases as the income increases. The tax brackets and rates are based on the 2022 US federal income tax brackets.",
