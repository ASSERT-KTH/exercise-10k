  "answer": "**Unscramble Word Game**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble the letters in a word\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef unscramble_word_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the unscramble word game\"\"\"\n    words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    attempts = 3\n\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    print(f\"You have {attempts} attempts.\")\n\n    while attempts > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n        if guess.lower() == word:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You unscrambled the word correctly.\")\n            return\n        else:\n            attempts -= 1\n            print(f\"Incorrect. You have {attempts} attempts remaining.\")\n\n    print(f\"Sorry, you didn't unscramble the word. The correct answer was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unscramble_word_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. You will be presented with a scrambled word and the number of attempts you have to guess the correct word.\n3. Enter your guess when prompted.\n4. If your guess is correct, you will be congratulated and the program will end.\n5. If your guess is incorrect, you will be told how many attempts you have remaining.\n6. If you use up all your attempts without guessing the word correctly, the program will reveal the correct answer.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and returns a scrambled version of the word.\n* The `unscramble_word_game` function plays the unscramble word game, selecting a random word from a list, scrambling it, and asking the user to guess the correct word.\n* The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word.\n* The program uses a simple text-based interface to interact with the user.",
