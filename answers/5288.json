  "prompt": "Write a program that implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted list. Use a while loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that implements the binary search algorithm according to the specifications:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n = 16;\n    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16};\n    int key = 13;\n    int low, high, mid;\n    low = 0;\n    high = n - 1;\n\n    while (low <= high) {\n        mid = (low + high) / 2;\n        if (key == a[mid]) {\n            cout << \"Target value \" << key << \" found at index \" << mid << endl;\n            return 0;\n        } else if (key < a[mid]) {\n            high = mid - 1;\n        } else {\n            low = mid + 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Target value \" << key << \" not found in the list.\" << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code implements the binary search algorithm as described in the specifications. It initializes the necessary variables, enters a while loop that continues until the target value is found or the search interval becomes empty, and updates the `low` and `high` indices based on the comparison between the target value and the middle element of the current search interval. If the target value is not found, it prints a message indicating that the value was not found in the list.",
