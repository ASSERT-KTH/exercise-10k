  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order, and provide a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function removes duplicates from a given list, preserving the original order.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list from which to remove duplicates.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed, preserving the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the elements we've seen so far\n    seen = {}\n    \n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # Check if the element is already in the 'seen' dictionary\n        if element not in seen:\n            # If it's not, add it to the 'seen' dictionary and the result list\n            seen[element] = True  # The value doesn't matter, we're just using the dictionary for its fast lookup\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_duplicates` initializes an empty dictionary `seen` to keep track of the elements encountered so far, and an empty list `result` to store the unique elements.\n* It iterates over each element in the `input_list`, checking if the element is already in the `seen` dictionary. If not, it adds the element to both the `seen` dictionary and the `result` list.\n* The function utilizes a dictionary for its fast lookup capability, allowing it to efficiently check for duplicates and maintain the original order of elements.\n* Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the unique elements from the original list, in the same order.",
