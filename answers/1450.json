  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the radius of a circle as input and outputs its area and circumference.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_properties(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the area and circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\n    \n    return area, circumference\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the radius from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n            if radius <= 0:\n                print(\"Radius must be positive.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the area and circumference\n    area, circumference = calculate_circle_properties(radius)\n    \n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Area: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Circumference: {circumference:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses the `math` module to access the `pi` constant.\n2. The `calculate_circle_properties` function takes the radius as input, calculates the area and circumference using the formulas `\u03c0r^2` and `2\u03c0r`, and returns the results as a tuple.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius, checks that the input is a positive number, and then calls `calculate_circle_properties` to get the area and circumference.\n4. The results are printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the radius of the circle: 5\nArea: 78.54\nCircumference: 31.42\n```",
