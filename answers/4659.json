  "answer": "**Daily Nutrition Needs Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a person's daily nutrition needs based on their age, weight, and height. It uses the Harris-Benedict equation to estimate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and then multiplies it by an activity factor to get the daily calorie needs.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmr(age, weight, height, sex):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict equation.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): Age in years\n        weight (float): Weight in kg\n        height (float): Height in cm\n        sex (str): Sex (male or female)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: BMR in calories/day\n    \"\"\"\n    if sex.lower() == 'male':\n        bmr = 66 + (6.2 * weight) + (12.7 * height) - (6.8 * age)\n    elif sex.lower() == 'female':\n        bmr = 655 + (4.35 * weight) + (4.7 * height) - (4.7 * age)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid sex. Please enter 'male' or 'female'.\")\n\n    return bmr\n\ndef calculate_daily_calories(bmr, activity_level):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the daily calorie needs based on the BMR and activity level.\n\n    Args:\n        bmr (float): BMR in calories/day\n        activity_level (str): Activity level (sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, extra active)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Daily calorie needs in calories/day\n    \"\"\"\n    activity_factors = {\n        'sedentary': 1.2,\n        'lightly active': 1.375,\n        'moderately active': 1.55,\n        'very active': 1.725,\n        'extra active': 1.9\n    }\n\n    daily_calories = bmr * activity_factors[activity_level]\n\n    return daily_calories\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Daily Nutrition Needs Calculator\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in cm: \"))\n    sex = input(\"Enter your sex (male or female): \")\n    activity_level = input(\"Enter your activity level (sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, extra active): \")\n\n    bmr = calculate_bmr(age, weight, height, sex)\n    daily_calories = calculate_daily_calories(bmr, activity_level)\n\n    print(f\"\\nYour BMR is: {bmr:.2f} calories/day\")\n    print(f\"Your daily calorie needs are: {daily_calories:.2f} calories/day\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter your age, weight, height, sex, and activity level when prompted.\n2. The program will calculate and display your BMR and daily calorie needs.\n\n**Note:** This program uses a simplified version of the Harris-Benedict equation and does not take into account other factors that can affect daily calorie needs, such as body composition and overall health. The results should be used as a rough estimate only and not as a substitute for professional medical advice.",
