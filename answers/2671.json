  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the string with all duplicate characters removed.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate characters from a string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Input String:\", input_string)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of characters we've already seen.\n2. We create an empty list `result` to store the characters without duplicates.\n3. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. For each character, we check if it's already in the `seen` set. If it's not, we add it to the `seen` set and append it to the `result` list.\n5. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over each character in the string once. The set operations (add and check) take constant time, so they don't affect the overall time complexity.",
