  "answer": "**Division and Remainder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns their division and remainder.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the result\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `divide_and_remainder` function takes two integers as input and returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n2. It first checks if the divisor is zero, in which case it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n3. It then calculates the quotient using integer division (`//`) and the remainder using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4. The `main` function gets user input, calls `divide_and_remainder`, and displays the result.\n5. It also catches and displays any `ZeroDivisionError` that may be raised.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Divide 17 by 5: `divide_and_remainder(17, 5)` returns `(3, 2)`\n* Divide 10 by 2: `divide_and_remainder(10, 2)` returns `(5, 0)`\n* Attempt to divide by zero: `divide_and_remainder(10, 0)` raises `ZeroDivisionError`",
