  "answer": "Here is a Python program that finds the intersection of two sets and prints the result:\n\n```python\ndef intersection(set1, set2):\n    \"\"\"Return the intersection of two sets.\"\"\"\n    return set1 & set2\n\ndef main():\n    # Define two sets\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n    # Find the intersection of the two sets\n    result = intersection(set1, set2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `intersection` that takes two sets as input and returns their intersection using the `&` operator. The `main` function defines two sets, finds their intersection using the `intersection` function, and prints the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nIntersection: {4, 5}\n```\n\nThis shows that the intersection of the two sets is the set containing the elements `4` and `5`, which are common to both sets.",
