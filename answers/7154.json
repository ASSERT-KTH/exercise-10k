  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two functions as input and returns their composition. The first function should take one argument and return a value, and the second function should take one argument and return a value. The composition of the two functions should be a new function that takes one argument and returns the result of applying the second function to the result of applying the first function.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a program that takes two functions as input and returns their composition, explaining the steps and code in detail. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as input and returns their composition.\n    \n    The first function should take one argument and return a value, \n    and the second function should take one argument and return a value.\n    \n    The composition of the two functions is a new function that takes one argument \n    and returns the result of applying the second function to the result of applying the first function.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function to be composed.\n        func2 (function): The second function to be composed.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a new function that will be the composition of func1 and func2\n    def composed_function(arg):\n        \n        # First, apply func1 to the argument\n        result_from_func1 = func1(arg)\n        \n        # Then, apply func2 to the result from func1\n        result_from_func2 = func2(result_from_func1)\n        \n        # Return the final result\n        return result_from_func2\n    \n    # Return the composed function\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\n\n# Define two simple functions\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions\ncomposed = compose_functions(double, add_one)\n\n# Test the composed function\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions `func1` and `func2` as input and returns a new function `composed_function` that represents their composition.\n* Within `composed_function`, it first applies `func1` to the input argument `arg` and stores the result in `result_from_func1`. Then, it applies `func2` to `result_from_func1` and stores the final result in `result_from_func2`.\n* The `composed_function` is then returned by `compose_functions`, allowing it to be used like any other function.\n* In the example usage, two simple functions `double` and `add_one` are defined, composed together using `compose_functions`, and then tested with the input `5` to demonstrate the composition's effect.",
