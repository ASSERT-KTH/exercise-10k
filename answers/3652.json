  "answer": "### Prime Number Check Function\n#### Overview\nThe following is a Python function that checks whether a given number is prime or not. This function works by checking divisibility of the number from 2 to its square root.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, int(sqrt_n) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"Is {num} prime? {is_prime(num)}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function first checks for the base cases:\n- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.\n- If `n` is 2, it's prime.\n- If `n` is divisible by 2 (and not 2 itself), it's not prime.\n\nThen it iterates from 3 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), incrementing by 2 each time (since all primes are of the form 6k \u00b1 1, with the exception of 2 and 3). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.\n\nIf `n` passes all these checks, it's prime, and the function returns True.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(\u221an) due to the loop up to the square root of `n`. This is a significant improvement over a naive approach that checks all the way up to `n`, which would have a time complexity of O(n).",
