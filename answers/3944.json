  "answer": "**Personalized Message Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program accepts a name and a message as input and prints out a personalized message.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_personalized_message():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a personalized message based on user input.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    message = input(\"Please enter a message: \")\n\n    # Print the personalized message\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! {message}\")\n\ndef main():\n    print_personalized_message()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name and a message. After entering the input, it will print out a personalized message.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter a message: Have a great day!\nHello, John! Have a great day!\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `print_personalized_message` function prompts the user to enter their name and a message using the `input` function.\n2. It then uses an f-string to format the personalized message with the user's name and message.\n3. The `main` function calls `print_personalized_message` to start the program.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.",
