  "answer": "**Measuring Execution Time of a Function**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that measures the execution time of another function. This function uses the `time` module to track the time before and after the execution of the target function.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef measure_execution_time(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator function to measure the execution time of another function.\n\n    Args:\n        func: The target function to be measured.\n\n    Returns:\n        A wrapped function that includes the execution time measurement.\n    \"\"\"\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        execution_time = end_time - start_time\n        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n@measure_execution_time\ndef example_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    An example function that simulates a time-consuming operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation\n\nexample_function()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  The `measure_execution_time` function takes a target function `func` as an argument.\n2.  It uses the `@wraps` decorator from the `functools` module to preserve the original function's metadata (e.g., name, docstring).\n3.  Inside the `wrapper` function, it records the current time before and after executing the target function using `time.time()`.\n4.  The execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n5.  The execution time is printed to the console with the function name.\n6.  The `wrapper` function returns the result of the target function.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n*   To measure the execution time of a specific function, simply decorate it with `@measure_execution_time`.\n*   You can modify the `measure_execution_time` function to return the execution time instead of printing it, allowing for further processing or logging.\n*   Consider using this decorator in combination with logging mechanisms for more comprehensive monitoring and debugging.",
