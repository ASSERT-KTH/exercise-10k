  "answer": "Here's a simple Python function to create a menu and get user input:\n\n```python\ndef display_menu():\n    \"\"\"Displays a menu with options and takes the user's choice as input.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the menu options\n    menu_options = {\n        \"1\": \"Option 1\",\n        \"2\": \"Option 2\",\n        \"3\": \"Option 3\",\n        \"4\": \"Exit\"\n    }\n    \n    # Display the menu\n    print(\"Menu:\")\n    for key, value in menu_options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    # Get the user's choice\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n        \n        # Validate the user's choice\n        if choice in menu_options:\n            if choice == \"4\":\n                print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(f\"You have chosen {menu_options[choice]}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\n# Example usage\ndisplay_menu()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `display_menu` function is defined with a docstring that describes its purpose.\n*   A dictionary called `menu_options` is created to store the menu options. The keys are the option numbers (as strings), and the values are the corresponding option names.\n*   The menu is displayed by iterating over the `menu_options` dictionary and printing each option.\n*   A `while` loop is used to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit (option 4).\n*   Inside the loop, the user's choice is validated by checking if it exists in the `menu_options` dictionary. If it does, the chosen option is displayed. If not, an error message is printed.\n*   If the user chooses to exit, a farewell message is printed, and the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.\n*   Finally, the `display_menu` function is called to demonstrate its usage.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can customize the `menu_options` dictionary to add or remove options as per your requirements.\n*   Consider adding more validation for the user's input, such as handling non-numeric input or input outside the range of available options.\n*   You can also use a `switch` statement (available in Python 3.10 and later) to handle the different options instead of using an `if-else` chain.\n*   To make the menu more interactive, you can use a library like `rich` to add colors, styles, and other visual effects to the menu.",
