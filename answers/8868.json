  "answer": "**Deficient Numbers Sum Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nA deficient number is a positive integer that is greater than the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_deficient_numbers(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of deficient numbers less than a given limit.\n\n    Args:\n        limit (int): The upper limit for the deficient numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of deficient numbers less than the limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.\n\n        Args:\n            n (int): The number for which to calculate the sum of proper divisors.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The sum of proper divisors of the number.\n        \"\"\"\n        return sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)\n\n    return sum(num for num in range(1, limit) if num > sum_of_proper_divisors(num))\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    limit = 100\n    result = sum_of_deficient_numbers(limit)\n    print(f\"The sum of deficient numbers less than {limit} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a helper function `sum_of_proper_divisors(n)` to calculate the sum of proper divisors for a given number `n`.\n2. Use a generator expression to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n-1` and check if each number is a divisor of `n`. If it is, add it to the sum.\n3. Define the main function `sum_of_deficient_numbers(limit)` to calculate the sum of deficient numbers less than the given `limit`.\n4. Use a generator expression to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `limit-1` and check if each number is greater than the sum of its proper divisors. If it is, add it to the sum.\n5. Return the sum of deficient numbers.\n\n### Note\n\n* This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. For large limits, a more efficient algorithm may be needed.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a limit of 100 and print the result.",
