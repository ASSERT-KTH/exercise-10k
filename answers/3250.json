  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples representing the coordinates of the two points in the 2D plane.\n*   It uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the two points: `\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n*   The distance is printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `distance_calculator.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program using Python: `python distance_calculator.py`\n\nThis will execute the program and print the distance between the two example points. You can modify the `point1` and `point2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the distance between different points.",
