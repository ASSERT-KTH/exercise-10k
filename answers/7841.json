  "answer": "### Calculating Average Grade and Identifying Above-Average Students\n\nHere's a Python function that calculates the average grade of all students and identifies the students who scored above the average grade.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades: dict) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of all students and identify the students who scored above the average grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the average grade and a list of students who scored above the average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input dictionary is empty\n    if not grades:\n        return None, []\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all grades\n    total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n\n    # Identify the students who scored above the average grade\n    above_average_students = [name for name, grade in grades.items() if grade > average_grade]\n\n    return average_grade, above_average_students\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    student_grades = {\n        \"Alice\": 90,\n        \"Bob\": 80,\n        \"Charlie\": 95,\n        \"David\": 85,\n        \"Eve\": 92\n    }\n\n    average, above_average = calculate_average_grade(student_grades)\n\n    print(f\"Average Grade: {average:.2f}\")\n    print(\"Students who scored above the average grade:\")\n    for student in above_average:\n        print(student)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average_grade` takes a dictionary `grades` where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.\n2. It calculates the sum of all grades using the built-in `sum` function and then divides it by the total number of students to get the average grade.\n3. It identifies the students who scored above the average grade using a list comprehension.\n4. The function returns a tuple containing the average grade and a list of students who scored above the average grade.\n5. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_average_grade` function with a dictionary of student grades.\n6. We print the average grade and the names of students who scored above the average grade.",
