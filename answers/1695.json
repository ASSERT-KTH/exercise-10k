  "answer": "**Median Calculation Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the median of a list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the list has an odd number of elements, return the middle element\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle elements\n    else:\n        mid1 = numbers[n // 2 - 1]\n        mid2 = numbers[n // 2]\n        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(calculate_median(numbers))  # Output: 5\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(calculate_median(numbers))  # Output: 3.5\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. The list is then sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.\n3. The length of the list is obtained using the `len()` function.\n4. If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle element, which is returned directly.\n5. If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The two middle elements are obtained using indexing, and their average is calculated and returned.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list contains non-numeric elements, the function may raise an error or produce incorrect results. You may want to add additional error checking or handling depending on your specific use case.",
