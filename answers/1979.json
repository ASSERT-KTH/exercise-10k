  "prompt": "Create a function that implements a graph search algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The function should take a graph and two nodes as arguments and return the shortest path.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that implements the graph search algorithm using breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, node1, node2):\n    # Check if the graph is empty\n    if not graph:\n        return None\n    \n    # Check if the nodes are in the graph\n    if node1 not in graph or node2 not in graph:\n        return None\n    \n    # Create a queue and enqueue the starting node\n    queue = deque([[node1]])\n    \n    # Create a set to store visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # While the queue is not empty\n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        \n        # If the node is not visited\n        if node not in visited:\n            # Mark the node as visited\n            visited.add(node)\n            \n            # If the node is the destination node, return the path\n            if node == node2:\n                return path\n            \n            # For each neighbor of the node that has not been visited\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    # Create a new path by appending the neighbor to the current path\n                    new_path = list(path)\n                    new_path.append(neighbor)\n                    \n                    # Enqueue the new path\n                    queue.append(new_path)\n    \n    # If there is no path between the nodes, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ngraph = {\n    'A': ['B', 'C'],\n    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'C': ['A', 'F'],\n    'D': ['B'],\n    'E': ['B', 'F'],\n    'F': ['C', 'E'],\n}\n\nprint(shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Output: ['A', 'C', 'F']\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `shortest_path` that takes a graph and two nodes as arguments and returns the shortest path between them. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes. The function uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit and a set to keep track of the visited nodes. It returns the shortest path as a list of nodes.",
