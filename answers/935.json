  "answer": "**Employee Management System**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple employee management system implemented in Python using if/else statements.\n\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, department, salary):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.department = department\n        self.salary = salary\n\nclass EmployeeManagementSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.employees = []\n\n    def add_employee(self, name, age, department, salary):\n        employee = Employee(name, age, department, salary)\n        self.employees.append(employee)\n        print(f\"Employee {name} added successfully.\")\n\n    def delete_employee(self, name):\n        for employee in self.employees:\n            if employee.name == name:\n                self.employees.remove(employee)\n                print(f\"Employee {name} deleted successfully.\")\n                return\n        print(f\"Employee {name} not found.\")\n\n    def update_employee(self, name, attribute, value):\n        for employee in self.employees:\n            if employee.name == name:\n                if attribute == \"name\":\n                    employee.name = value\n                elif attribute == \"age\":\n                    employee.age = int(value)\n                elif attribute == \"department\":\n                    employee.department = value\n                elif attribute == \"salary\":\n                    employee.salary = float(value)\n                print(f\"Employee {name} updated successfully.\")\n                return\n        print(f\"Employee {name} not found.\")\n\n    def display_employees(self):\n        if len(self.employees) == 0:\n            print(\"No employees found.\")\n        else:\n            for employee in self.employees:\n                print(f\"Name: {employee.name}\")\n                print(f\"Age: {employee.age}\")\n                print(f\"Department: {employee.department}\")\n                print(f\"Salary: {employee.salary}\")\n                print(\"-------------------------\")\n\ndef main():\n    system = EmployeeManagementSystem()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nEmployee Management System Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Employee\")\n        print(\"2. Delete Employee\")\n        print(\"3. Update Employee\")\n        print(\"4. Display Employees\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter employee name: \")\n            age = input(\"Enter employee age: \")\n            department = input(\"Enter employee department: \")\n            salary = input(\"Enter employee salary: \")\n            system.add_employee(name, age, department, salary)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter employee name: \")\n            system.delete_employee(name)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            name = input(\"Enter employee name: \")\n            attribute = input(\"Enter attribute to update (name, age, department, salary): \")\n            value = input(\"Enter new value: \")\n            system.update_employee(name, attribute, value)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            system.display_employees()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Exiting the system. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. You will see the Employee Management System Menu.\n3. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.\n4. Follow the prompts to add, delete, update, or display employees.\n5. To exit the system, choose option 5.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This is a simple console-based application and does not include any data validation or error handling.\n* The employee data is stored in memory and will be lost when the program exits.\n* For a real-world application, you would want to use a database to store the employee data and include proper error handling and validation.",
