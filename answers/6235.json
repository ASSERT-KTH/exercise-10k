  "answer": "**Missing Number in Consecutive Sequence**\n=========================================\n\nThis program finds the missing number in a given sequence of consecutive numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in a given sequence of consecutive numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of consecutive numbers with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete\n    complete_sum = sum(range(min(sequence), max(sequence) + 1))\n    \n    # Calculate the actual sum of the sequence\n    actual_sum = sum(sequence)\n    \n    # The missing number is the difference between the complete sum and the actual sum\n    missing_number = complete_sum - actual_sum\n    \n    return missing_number\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)\n    print(f\"The missing number in the sequence is: {missing_number}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `find_missing_number` function takes a list of consecutive numbers as input.\n2. It calculates the sum of the sequence if it were complete using the `range` function and the `min` and `max` functions to determine the start and end of the sequence.\n3. It calculates the actual sum of the sequence using the `sum` function.\n4. The missing number is the difference between the complete sum and the actual sum.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `find_missing_number` function with an example sequence.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Finding a missing number in a sequence of consecutive IDs: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`\n* Finding a missing number in a sequence of consecutive numbers: `[10, 11, 12, 14, 15]`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input sequence is a list of consecutive numbers with one number missing. If the sequence has more than one missing number or is not consecutive, this program will not work as expected.",
