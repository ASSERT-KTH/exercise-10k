  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple quiz program implemented in Python. The program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n```python\n# Define the quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": \"Van Gogh\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\"\n}\n\ndef administer_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"Administers the quiz and returns the final score.\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, answer in questions.items():\n        user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    score = administer_quiz(quiz_questions)\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `quiz_questions` that stores the quiz questions and answers.\n2. The `administer_quiz` function takes the quiz questions as input and iterates over each question.\n3. For each question, the program prompts the user for an answer and checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer using an if/else statement.\n4. If the user's answer is correct, the program increments the score and prints a confirmation message.\n5. If the user's answer is incorrect, the program prints an error message with the correct answer.\n6. The `main` function calls the `administer_quiz` function and prints the final score.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the script. The program will prompt you with a series of questions, and you can respond with your answers. The program will keep track of your score and display it at the end of the quiz.",
