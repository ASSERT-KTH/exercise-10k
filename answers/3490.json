  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and returns its surface area.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n\n    # A cube has 6 faces, each with an area of side_length^2\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = cube_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is {surface_area} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `cube_surface_area` function takes one argument: `side_length`, which is the length of one side of the cube.\n*   It first checks if the `side_length` is less than or equal to zero and raises a `ValueError` if it is, since a cube's side length cannot be non-positive.\n*   The surface area of a cube is calculated by multiplying the area of one face (`side_length` squared) by the total number of faces (6).\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `cube_surface_area` by prompting the user for a side length, calculating the surface area, and then printing the result.\n*   If the user enters a non-positive number, it catches the `ValueError` and prints an error message instead.",
