  "answer": "**Triangle Perimeter Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): Length of side a.\n        b (float): Length of side b.\n        c (float): Length of side c.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Perimeter of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid triangle sides. The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\")\n\n    perimeter = a + b + c\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of side a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of side b: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of side c: \"))\n\n    try:\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the triangle is: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_perimeter` function takes the lengths of the three sides as input and returns the perimeter.\n2. It first checks if the input sides can form a valid triangle (i.e., the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The perimeter is calculated by simply adding the lengths of the three sides.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input the lengths of the three sides.\n5. The `calculate_perimeter` function is called with the user-input values, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the lengths of the three sides when prompted.\n2. The program will calculate and print the perimeter of the triangle.\n\n**Note:** This program assumes that the input sides are valid (i.e., non-negative and can form a triangle). If invalid input is provided, the program will raise a `ValueError`.",
