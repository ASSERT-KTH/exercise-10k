  "answer": "Here's an example of a simple Python program that reads input from a network socket and prints out the contents using the `socket` library.\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef read_from_socket(host, port):\n    # Create a socket object\n    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Connect to the server\n    client_socket.connect((host, port))\n\n    # Receive data from the server\n    data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n    while data:\n        print(data.decode())\n        data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n\n    # Close the socket\n    client_socket.close()\n\ndef main():\n    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost\n    port = 8080         # Arbitrary non-privileged port\n\n    read_from_socket(host, port)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this example, we're connecting to a server running on `localhost` at port `8080`. The `read_from_socket` function creates a socket, connects to the server, receives data from the server, prints it out, and then closes the socket.\n\nTo test this program, you'll need a server running on the specified host and port. Here's a simple example of a server using the `socket` library:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_server(host, port):\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to the port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Wait for a connection\n        print(\"Waiting for a connection...\")\n        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()\n\n        try:\n            print(f\"Connection from {client_address} has been established!\")\n\n            # Send data to the client\n            data = \"Hello, client!\"\n            connection.sendall(data.encode())\n\n        finally:\n            # Close the connection\n            connection.close()\n\ndef main():\n    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost\n    port = 8080         # Arbitrary non-privileged port\n\n    start_server(host, port)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run the client and server, save the client code in a file named `client.py` and the server code in a file named `server.py`. Run the server first by executing `python server.py` in your terminal, then run the client by executing `python client.py` in a separate terminal.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example. Real-world applications would require error handling, possibly multi-threading or asynchronous I/O, and other features depending on the specific requirements.",
