  "prompt": "Write a function that uses the filter function to filter a list of numbers and return the numbers that satisfy a given condition.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters a list of numbers based on a given condition, and provide a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef filter_numbers(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters a list of numbers based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns True or False.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to define the function that we will use as the condition for filtering\n    # In this case, we will use the condition function passed as an argument\n\n    # Then, we use the filter function to filter the list of numbers\n    # The filter function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable\n    # It returns an iterator that yields the items from the iterable for which the function returns True\n    filtered_numbers = filter(condition, numbers)\n\n    # Finally, we convert the iterator returned by the filter function to a list\n    # This is because the problem statement asks for a list as output\n    # We use the list function to convert the iterator to a list\n    result = list(filtered_numbers)\n\n    # Now, we return the list of numbers that satisfy the given condition\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a condition function\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Filter the list of numbers using the condition function\nfiltered_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)\n\n# Print the filtered list of numbers\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `filter_numbers` function takes two arguments: `numbers` (a list of numbers to be filtered) and `condition` (a function that defines the filtering criteria). It returns a list of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n* Inside the `filter_numbers` function, the `filter` function is used to filter the `numbers` list based on the `condition` function. The `filter` function returns an iterator that yields the items from the `numbers` list for which the `condition` function returns `True`.\n* The `list` function is then used to convert the iterator returned by the `filter` function to a list, which is stored in the `result` variable and returned by the `filter_numbers` function.\n* In the example usage, a condition function `is_even` is defined to check if a number is even, and a list of numbers is filtered using this condition function. The filtered list is then printed to the console.",
