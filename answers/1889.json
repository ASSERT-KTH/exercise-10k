  "answer": "**Assignment Operators**\n========================\n\nAssignment operators are used to update the value of a variable. Here are some examples:\n\n### Basic Assignment Operator (=)\n\nThe basic assignment operator is used to assign a new value to a variable.\n\n```python\nx = 5  # assign 5 to x\nprint(x)  # prints 5\n```\n\n### Addition Assignment Operator (+=)\n\nThe addition assignment operator is used to add a value to the current value of a variable.\n\n```python\nx = 5  # assign 5 to x\nx += 3  # add 3 to x\nprint(x)  # prints 8\n```\n\n### Subtraction Assignment Operator (-=)\n\nThe subtraction assignment operator is used to subtract a value from the current value of a variable.\n\n```python\nx = 5  # assign 5 to x\nx -= 3  # subtract 3 from x\nprint(x)  # prints 2\n```\n\n### Multiplication Assignment Operator (*=)\n\nThe multiplication assignment operator is used to multiply the current value of a variable by a value.\n\n```python\nx = 5  # assign 5 to x\nx *= 3  # multiply x by 3\nprint(x)  # prints 15\n```\n\n### Division Assignment Operator (/=)\n\nThe division assignment operator is used to divide the current value of a variable by a value.\n\n```python\nx = 15  # assign 15 to x\nx /= 3  # divide x by 3\nprint(x)  # prints 5.0\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nHere are some example use cases for assignment operators:\n\n*   Updating a counter variable: `count += 1`\n*   Updating a total variable: `total += amount`\n*   Decreasing a quantity variable: `quantity -= amount`\n*   Scaling a value: `value *= scale`\n*   Normalizing a value: `value /= max_value`\n\n### Code Example\n\nHere is a Python code example that demonstrates the use of assignment operators:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    x = 5\n    print(\"Initial value of x:\", x)\n\n    # Addition assignment operator\n    x += 3\n    print(\"Value of x after addition:\", x)\n\n    # Subtraction assignment operator\n    x -= 2\n    print(\"Value of x after subtraction:\", x)\n\n    # Multiplication assignment operator\n    x *= 2\n    print(\"Value of x after multiplication:\", x)\n\n    # Division assignment operator\n    x /= 2\n    print(\"Value of x after division:\", x)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nInitial value of x: 5\nValue of x after addition: 8\nValue of x after subtraction: 6\nValue of x after multiplication: 12\nValue of x after division: 6.0\n```",
