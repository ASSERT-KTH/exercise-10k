  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation. The program should then use these functions to calculate and print the result of a series of operations.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n# Define the functions\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    return x / y\n\n# Calculate and print the results\nprint(add(5, 2))\nprint(subtract(5, 2))\nprint(multiply(5, 2))\nprint(divide(5, 2))\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic functions and uses them to calculate and print the results of the corresponding operations, as specified. Note that this code does not include any error handling, such as checking for division by zero or non-numeric input. In a real-world application, you would want to add such checks to make the code more robust.",
