  "answer": "**Calculating Factorial Using a For Loop**\n==========================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n\n    # Initialize the result variable to 1\n    result = 1\n\n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Multiply the result by the current number\n        result *= i\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {calculate_factorial(num)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n------------------------\n\n1.  The `calculate_factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n2.  It first checks if the input number is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n3.  It initializes a variable `result` to 1, which will store the factorial of the input number.\n4.  It uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n5.  Inside the loop, it multiplies the `result` by the current number `i`.\n6.  Finally, it returns the calculated factorial.\n7.  The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_factorial` function with an example.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nWhen you run the program with the input `5`, it will output:\n\n```\nThe factorial of 5 is: 120\n```\n\nThis is because the factorial of 5 is calculated as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.",
