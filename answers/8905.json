  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nHere's an example implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    lst (list): The list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort\n        swapped = False\n        \n        # Start looking at each item of the list one by one, comparing it with its adjacent value\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If we find an element that is greater than the next element, then swap them\n            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]\n                # Set the flag to True so we'll loop again\n                swapped = True\n        \n        # If there were no swaps during the last iteration, the list is already sorted, and we can terminate\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    \n    return lst\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    lst = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", lst)\n    sorted_lst = bubble_sort(lst)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_lst)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The outer loop (`for i in range(n)`) iterates over each element in the list.\n2. The inner loop (`for j in range(n - i - 1)`) compares each element with its adjacent element.\n3. If an element is greater than its adjacent element, they are swapped.\n4. The `swapped` flag is used to check if any swaps were made in the inner loop. If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm terminates early.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of bubble sort is:\n\n* Best-case: O(n) when the list is already sorted\n* Worst-case: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order\n* Average-case: O(n^2) for random lists\n\nNote: Bubble sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its high time complexity. For larger datasets, other sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort are more efficient.",
