  "answer": "**First Non-Duplicate Character Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string input and returns the first character that appears only once in the string. If no such character exists, it returns `None`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef first_non_duplicate_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-duplicate character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): Input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-duplicate character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store character frequencies\n    char_freq = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-duplicate character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_freq[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-duplicate character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    s = \"hello\"\n    result = first_non_duplicate_char(s)\n    if result:\n        print(f\"The first non-duplicate character is: {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No non-duplicate character found.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The program uses a dictionary `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  It iterates over the string to populate the `char_freq` dictionary.\n3.  Then, it iterates over the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n4.  If such a character is found, it is returned; otherwise, the program returns `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it makes two passes over the string: one to count character frequencies and another to find the first non-duplicate character.",
