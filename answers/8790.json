  "answer": "**Weight Converter Program**\n====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a weight in pounds as input and returns its equivalent in kilograms.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef pounds_to_kilograms(pounds: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a weight in pounds to kilograms.\n\n    Args:\n        pounds (float): The weight in pounds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The weight in kilograms.\n    \"\"\"\n    kilograms = pounds * 0.45359237\n    return kilograms\n\ndef main():\n    pounds = float(input(\"Enter a weight in pounds: \"))\n    kilograms = pounds_to_kilograms(pounds)\n    print(f\"{pounds} pounds is equal to {kilograms:.2f} kilograms.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `pounds_to_kilograms` function takes a weight in pounds as input and returns its equivalent in kilograms.\n2. The conversion factor is 0.45359237, which is the number of kilograms in one pound.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds, calls the `pounds_to_kilograms` function, and prints the result.\n4. The `:.2f` format specifier is used to round the result to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter a weight in pounds: 100\n100.0 pounds is equal to 45.36 kilograms.\n```",
