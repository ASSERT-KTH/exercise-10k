  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year using an if statement. A year is a leap year if it is perfectly divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and checks if it is a leap year.\n2. The if statement checks two conditions:\n   - The year is divisible by 4.\n   - The year is not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by 400.\n3. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the year is a leap year. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a year, and the `is_leap_year` function is called to check if the year is a leap year.\n5. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 2020\n  Output: 2020 is a leap year.\n* Input: 2019\n  Output: 2019 is not a leap year.\n* Input: 2000\n  Output: 2000 is a leap year.\n* Input: 1900\n  Output: 1900 is not a leap year.",
