  "answer": "**To-Do List Program**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a for loop to manage a to-do list. The program allows the user to add, remove, and display tasks.\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty list to store tasks\ntasks = []\n\ndef display_tasks():\n    \"\"\"Display all tasks in the to-do list.\"\"\"\n    if not tasks:\n        print(\"No tasks in the to-do list.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"To-Do List:\")\n        for i, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):\n            print(f\"{i}. {task}\")\n\ndef add_task():\n    \"\"\"Add a new task to the to-do list.\"\"\"\n    task = input(\"Enter a new task: \")\n    tasks.append(task)\n    print(f\"Task '{task}' added successfully.\")\n\ndef remove_task():\n    \"\"\"Remove a task from the to-do list.\"\"\"\n    if not tasks:\n        print(\"No tasks in the to-do list.\")\n    else:\n        display_tasks()\n        try:\n            task_number = int(input(\"Enter the task number to remove: \"))\n            if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):\n                task = tasks.pop(task_number - 1)\n                print(f\"Task '{task}' removed successfully.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid task number.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nTo-Do List Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Display Tasks\")\n        print(\"2. Add Task\")\n        print(\"3. Remove Task\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        \n        try:\n            choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice: \"))\n            if choice == 1:\n                display_tasks()\n            elif choice == 2:\n                add_task()\n            elif choice == 3:\n                remove_task()\n            elif choice == 4:\n                print(\"Goodbye!\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Display Tasks (1): Shows all tasks in the to-do list.\n\t* Add Task (2): Prompts the user to enter a new task, which is then added to the list.\n\t* Remove Task (3): Displays the current tasks, prompts the user to enter the task number to remove, and then removes the task from the list.\n\t* Quit (4): Exits the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to quit.\n\n**Note:** This program uses a simple text-based interface and stores tasks in a list. It does not persist tasks between runs, so all tasks will be lost when the program exits. For a more robust to-do list app, consider using a database or file storage to persist tasks.",
