  "answer": "### Student Ages Dictionary\n\nHere is a Python dictionary with 5 key-value pairs where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages:\n\n```python\n# Define the dictionary\nstudent_ages = {\n    \"John\": 18,\n    \"Alice\": 20,\n    \"Bob\": 19,\n    \"Eve\": 21,\n    \"Mike\": 18\n}\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    # Print the entire dictionary\n    print(\"Student Ages:\")\n    for name, age in student_ages.items():\n        print(f\"{name}: {age}\")\n\n    # Access a specific student's age\n    print(f\"\\nJohn's age: {student_ages['John']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a dictionary called `student_ages` with 5 key-value pairs.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to print the entire dictionary and access a specific student's age.\n*   You can run this code to see the output.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the ages of all students and then John's age specifically.",
