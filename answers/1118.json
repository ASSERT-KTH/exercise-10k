  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculating the average grade of a student: `[90, 80, 70, 85, 95]`\n* Calculating the average temperature for a week: `[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]`\n* Calculating the average score of a team: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`",
