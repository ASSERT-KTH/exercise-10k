  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the Cartesian product of two lists of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef cartesian_product(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Cartesian product of two lists of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is a pair of numbers from list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.product(list1, list2))\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\nresult = cartesian_product(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Cartesian product:\")\nfor pair in result:\n    print(pair)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `itertools.product` function is used to calculate the Cartesian product. This function returns an iterator that produces tuples, where the first element of the tuple comes from the first list, the second element comes from the second list, and so on.\n\nThe `cartesian_product` function takes two lists as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a pair of numbers from the input lists.\n\nIn the example usage, we define two lists `list1` and `list2`, and then call the `cartesian_product` function to calculate their Cartesian product. The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\nThe output of the program will be:\n```\nCartesian product:\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(1, 6)\n(2, 4)\n(2, 5)\n(2, 6)\n(3, 4)\n(3, 5)\n(3, 6)\n```\n\nThis shows the Cartesian product of the two input lists, where each pair of numbers is a tuple containing one element from each list.",
