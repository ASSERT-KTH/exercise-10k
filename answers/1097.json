  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism as input and outputs the surface area.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the surface area of a rectangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_surface_area(length, width, height):\n    # Calculate the surface area of the rectangular prism\n    surface_area = 2 * (length * width + width * height + height * length)\n\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dimensions of the rectangular prism from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangular prism: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the rectangular prism: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the surface area\n    surface_area = calculate_surface_area(length, width, height)\n    print(f\"The surface area of the rectangular prism is: {surface_area}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The program first defines a function called `calculate_surface_area` which takes the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism as arguments.\n2. Inside this function, it calculates the surface area using the formula `2 * (length * width + width * height + height * length)`.\n3. The `main` function gets the dimensions of the rectangular prism from the user.\n4. It then calls the `calculate_surface_area` function with the user's input and prints out the result.\n\n### Formula Explanation:\n\nThe surface area of a rectangular prism is calculated by summing up the areas of all six faces. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- There are two faces with dimensions `length` x `width`, so their total area is `2 * length * width`.\n- There are two faces with dimensions `width` x `height`, so their total area is `2 * width * height`.\n- There are two faces with dimensions `height` x `length`, so their total area is `2 * height * length`.\n\nBy adding these up, we get the total surface area: `2 * (length * width + width * height + height * length)`.",
