  "answer": "**Next Greater Element Problem**\n\nThe next greater element problem is a common problem in algorithm design. Given a list of integers, we need to find the next greater element for each element in the list.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nWe can solve this problem using a stack data structure. The idea is to iterate through the list and for each element, we pop all elements from the stack that are smaller than the current element and update their next greater element. Then, we push the current element onto the stack.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef next_greater_element(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the next greater element for each element in the list.\n\n    Args:\n    nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of next greater elements. If no greater element is found, returns -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    result = [-1] * len(nums)\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        # Pop all elements from the stack that are smaller than the current element\n        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:\n            # Update the next greater element for the popped element\n            result[stack.pop()] = nums[i]\n        # Push the current element onto the stack\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [4, 5, 2, 25]\nprint(next_greater_element(nums))  # Output: [5, 25, 25, -1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We initialize an empty stack and a result list with all elements set to -1.\n*   We iterate through the input list. For each element, we check if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is smaller than the current element.\n*   If the condition is true, we pop the top element from the stack and update its next greater element in the result list.\n*   We repeat this process until the stack is empty or the top element is not smaller than the current element.\n*   Finally, we push the current element onto the stack and move to the next element.\n*   If an element is not found to have a greater element, its next greater element remains -1 in the result list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the stack.",
