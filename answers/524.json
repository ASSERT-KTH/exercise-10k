  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the longest common subsequence between two input strings. It uses dynamic programming to build a 2D table, where each cell represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the substrings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = len(str1)\n    n = len(str2)\n\n    # Create a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the table\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    # Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order\n    return \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"AGGTAB\"\nstr2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\nprint(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: \"GTAB\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Create a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n2.  Fill the table in a bottom-up manner by comparing characters from `str1` and `str2`. If the characters match, the length of the common subsequence is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the maximum length from the previous cells is taken.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence by tracing back the table from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence as a string.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. This is because we need to fill the 2D table, which has m \\* n cells.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), which is the size of the 2D table.",
