We define a `Rational` class with `numerator` and `denominator` attributes.\n2.  The `simplify` method simplifies the rational number by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.\n3.  We override the `__str__` method to provide a string representation of the rational number.\n4.  We define methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational numbers using the corresponding operator overloading methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__`).\n5.  In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of these methods with example rational numbers.",
