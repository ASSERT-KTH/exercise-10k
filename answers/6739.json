  "answer": "**Debouncing Program**\n=======================\n\nDebouncing is a technique used to prevent multiple triggers of an event within a short period of time. This program will debounce input data to prevent multiple triggers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\nHere is a Python program that debounces input data:\n```python\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable\n\nclass Debouncer:\n    def __init__(self, timeout: float, callback: Callable):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the debouncer.\n\n        Args:\n            timeout (float): The time in seconds to wait before triggering the callback.\n            callback (Callable): The function to call when the debouncer is triggered.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.timeout = timeout\n        self.callback = callback\n        self.last_trigger = 0\n\n    def trigger(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Trigger the debouncer.\n        \"\"\"\n        current_time = time.time()\n        if current_time - self.last_trigger > self.timeout:\n            self.callback()\n            self.last_trigger = current_time\n\n# Example usage\ndef example_callback():\n    print(\"Callback triggered\")\n\ndebouncer = Debouncer(timeout=0.5, callback=example_callback)\n\n# Simulate input data\nfor i in range(10):\n    debouncer.trigger()\n    time.sleep(0.2)\n```\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `Debouncer` class takes two arguments: `timeout` and `callback`.\n2. The `timeout` argument specifies the time in seconds to wait before triggering the callback.\n3. The `callback` argument is the function to call when the debouncer is triggered.\n4. The `trigger` method checks if the time since the last trigger is greater than the timeout. If it is, the callback is called and the last trigger time is updated.\n5. In the example usage, we create a debouncer with a timeout of 0.5 seconds and a callback function `example_callback`.\n6. We simulate input data by calling the `trigger` method 10 times with a delay of 0.2 seconds between each call.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. When the `trigger` method is called, it checks if the time since the last trigger is greater than the timeout.\n2. If the time since the last trigger is less than the timeout, the callback is not called.\n3. If the time since the last trigger is greater than the timeout, the callback is called and the last trigger time is updated.\n4. This ensures that the callback is only called once within the specified timeout period, preventing multiple triggers.\n\n**Advantages**\n--------------\n\n1. Prevents multiple triggers of an event within a short period of time.\n2. Reduces the number of times the callback is called, improving performance.\n3. Simple to implement and use.\n\n**Use Cases**\n-------------\n\n1. Button debouncing: Prevents multiple button presses from being registered within a short period of time.\n2. Input validation: Prevents multiple validation checks from being performed within a short period of time.\n3. Event handling: Prevents multiple events from being triggered within a short period of time.",
