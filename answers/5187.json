  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. The program should generate two random numbers between 1 and 6 and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates rolling two six-sided dice.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the results of the two dice rolls.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate two random numbers between 1 and 6\n    dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    \n    return dice1, dice2\n\ndef main():\n    # Roll the dice\n    result1, result2 = roll_dice()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"You rolled a {result1} and a {result2}. The total is {result1 + result2}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We import the `random` module to generate random numbers.\n* The `roll_dice` function simulates rolling two six-sided dice by generating two random numbers between 1 and 6 using `random.randint(1, 6)`.\n* The `main` function calls `roll_dice`, stores the results, and prints them along with their total.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program to simulate rolling two dice.\n* Modify the `roll_dice` function to simulate rolling different types of dice (e.g., 20-sided dice).\n* Use the `roll_dice` function in a larger program to simulate more complex games or scenarios.",
