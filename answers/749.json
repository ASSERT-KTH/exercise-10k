  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates a student's average grade:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of grades from the user\n    num_grades = int(input(\"Enter the number of grades: \"))\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the grades\n    grades = []\n\n    # Get each grade from the user and add it to the list\n    for i in range(num_grades):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(f\"Enter grade {i+1}: \"))\n                if 0 <= grade <= 100:\n                    grades.append(grade)\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Grade must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    print(f\"Your average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a list of grades as input and returns the average grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the number of grades from the user and initializes an empty list to store the grades.\n3. It then gets each grade from the user, checks if the input is a valid number between 0 and 100, and adds it to the list.\n4. Once all grades are entered, it calculates the average grade using the `calculate_average_grade` function and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of grades and then each grade individually. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the number of grades: 3\nEnter grade 1: 90\nEnter grade 2: 80\nEnter grade 3: 95\nYour average grade is: 88.33\n```",
