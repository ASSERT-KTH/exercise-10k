The class has methods to:\n\n*   Set the user's monthly income\n*   Add expenses with categories and amounts\n*   View a summary of expenses\n*   Calculate the total expenses\n*   Provide budget recommendations based on the user's income and expenses\n\nThe `run` method serves as the program's main loop, presenting the user with options to interact with the expense tracker.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1.  Run the program and set your monthly income.\n2.  Add expenses with categories and amounts (e.g., rent, groceries, entertainment).\n3.  View your expense summary to see the categories and amounts.\n4.  Calculate your total expenses to see the overall amount.\n5.  Get budget recommendations based on your income and expenses.\n\n**Budgeting Recommendations**\n---------------------------\n\nThe program provides budgeting recommendations based on the following conditions:\n\n*   If total expenses exceed income, it warns the user to reduce expenses or increase income.\n*   If the expense-to-income ratio is greater than 0.7, it warns the user that their expenses are high and suggests reducing them.\n*   If the user is within a healthy budget range (expense-to-income ratio less than or equal to 0.7), it provides a positive message.",
