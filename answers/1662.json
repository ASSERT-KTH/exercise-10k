  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes a student's score as input and prints the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Based on the specifications you provided, here is the code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int score;\n\n    printf(\"Enter your score: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &score);\n\n    if (score >= 90) {\n        printf(\"Your grade is A\\n\");\n    } else if (score >= 80) {\n        printf(\"Your grade is B\\n\");\n    } else if (score >= 70) {\n        printf(\"Your grade is C\\n\");\n    } else if (score >= 60) {\n        printf(\"Your grade is D\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Your grade is F\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code does exactly what the specifications describe. It takes a score as input from the user, checks the score against the grade criteria using `if` and `else if` statements, and prints the corresponding grade to the console.",
