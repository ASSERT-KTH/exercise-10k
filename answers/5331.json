  "answer": "**Character Conversion and Printing**\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Declare a character variable with the value 'A'\nchar_variable = 'A'\n\n# Convert the character to uppercase\nuppercase_char = char_variable.upper()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Original Character:\", char_variable)\nprint(\"Uppercase Character:\", uppercase_char)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We declare a character variable `char_variable` and assign it the value 'A'.\n2. We use the `upper()` method to convert the character to uppercase and store the result in `uppercase_char`.\n3. Finally, we print both the original character and the uppercase character to verify the conversion.\n\n### Example Output\n```\nOriginal Character: A\nUppercase Character: A\n```\nNote that in this case, the original character 'A' is already uppercase, so the conversion does not change its value. If we had started with a lowercase character, the conversion would produce a different result.",
