  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not based on the following conditions: a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\ndef is_leap(year):\n    leap = False\n\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                leap = True\n        else:\n            leap = True\n\n    return leap\n\nyear = int(input())\nprint(is_leap(year))\n```\nI've followed the specification step by step:\n\n1. Defined a function `is_leap(year)` that takes an integer argument `year`.\n2. Initialized a boolean variable `leap` to `False`.\n3. Checked if the year is evenly divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (`year % 4 == 0`).\n4. If the year is a century year, checked if it is evenly divisible by 400.\n5. If the year is not a century year, set `leap` to `True`.\n6. Returned the value of `leap` at the end of the function.\n7. Took user input using `input()`, converted it to an integer using `int()`, and stored it in the variable `year`.\n8. Called the `is_leap(year)` function with the user input and printed the result.\n\nThis code should work as expected, determining whether a given year is a leap year or not based on the conditions specified.",
