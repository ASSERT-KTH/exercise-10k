  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The first point as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates.\n        point2 (tuple): The second point as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two points as input, each represented as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates.\n2. It calculates the difference in x and y coordinates between the two points.\n3. It uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the two points: `\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the distance between two cities on a map\n* Determining the distance between two objects in a game or simulation\n* Measuring the distance between two points in a graph or chart\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is suitable for most 2D distance calculations. However, if you need to calculate distances on a sphere or other non-Euclidean space, you may need to use a different formula.",
