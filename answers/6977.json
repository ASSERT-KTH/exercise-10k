Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences between `str1` and `str2`.\n2.  Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming. If the current characters in `str1` and `str2` are the same, the length of the common subsequence is one more than the length of the common subsequence without these characters. Otherwise, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum length of the common subsequences without the current character in `str1` or `str2`.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence by tracing back the 2D array from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner. If the current characters in `str1` and `str2` are the same, add the character to the longest common subsequence and move diagonally up and left. Otherwise, move up or left depending on which cell has a larger value.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order by reversing the list of characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(m \\* n) due to the 2D array used for dynamic programming.",
