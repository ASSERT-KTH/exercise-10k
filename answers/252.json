  "answer": "### Function to Find Common Elements in Two Lists\n#### Description\nThis function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both lists.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both input lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(common_elements(list1, list2))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `list1`. If an element is also found in `list2`, it is included in the new list. The resulting list of common elements is then returned.\n\n#### Note\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. For large lists, a more efficient approach might be to convert the lists to sets and find their intersection, which would have a time complexity of O(n + m). Here's an example of how you could do that:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n```\n\nThis version of the function works by converting `list1` and `list2` to sets, finding their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converting the resulting set back to a list. Note that this version of the function does not preserve the original order of the elements.",
