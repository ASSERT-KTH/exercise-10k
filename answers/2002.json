  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and returns the corresponding grade using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the input score:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the input score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\"\n\n    # Determine the grade based on the score\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score as input\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(\"The student's grade is:\", grade)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade as a string.\n* The function first checks if the input `score` is valid (between 0 and 100). If not, it returns an error message.\n* The function then uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the `score`. The grades are assigned as follows:\n\t+ A: 90-100\n\t+ B: 80-89\n\t+ C: 70-79\n\t+ D: 60-69\n\t+ F: below 60\n* The `main` function gets the student's score as input, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 92: The program will output \"The student's grade is: A\".\n* Enter a score of 75: The program will output \"The student's grade is: C\".\n* Enter a score of 42: The program will output \"The student's grade is: F\".\n* Enter a score of 102: The program will output \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\".",
