  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns two new lists, where the first list contains the first element of each tuple, and the second list contains the second element of each tuple. This will help you understand how to separate tuple elements into distinct lists. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef separate_tuples(tuples_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of tuples as input and returns two new lists.\n    The first list contains the first element of each tuple, and the second list contains the second element of each tuple.\n\n    Args:\n        tuples_list (list): A list of tuples.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: Two lists, the first containing the first elements of the tuples and the second containing the second elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements of the tuples\n    first_elements = []\n    \n    # Initialize another empty list to store the second elements of the tuples\n    second_elements = []\n\n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Append the first element of the current tuple to the first_elements list\n        first_elements.append(tup[0])\n        \n        # Append the second element of the current tuple to the second_elements list\n        second_elements.append(tup[1])\n\n    # Return the two lists\n    return first_elements, second_elements\n\n# Example usage:\ntuples_list = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]\nfirst, second = separate_tuples(tuples_list)\nprint(\"First elements:\", first)\nprint(\"Second elements:\", second)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `separate_tuples` is defined with a parameter `tuples_list`, which is expected to be a list of tuples. It initializes two empty lists, `first_elements` and `second_elements`, to store the first and second elements of the tuples, respectively.\n*   It then iterates over each tuple in the input list using a `for` loop. Within the loop, it appends the first element of the current tuple (`tup[0]`) to `first_elements` and the second element (`tup[1]`) to `second_elements`.\n*   After processing all tuples, the function returns the `first_elements` and `second_elements` lists.\n*   In the example usage, a list of tuples `tuples_list` is provided as input to the `separate_tuples` function, and the resulting lists are printed to demonstrate the function's output.",
