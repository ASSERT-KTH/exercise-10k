  "answer": "**Voting Eligibility Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a person's age as input and prints out whether they are eligible to vote or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The person's age.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    voting_age = 18\n    return age >= voting_age\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the person's age from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    # Check if the person is eligible to vote\n    if check_voting_eligibility(age):\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your age when prompted.\n3. The program will print out whether you are eligible to vote or not.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the voting age is 18. You can modify the `voting_age` variable to change this.\n* The program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values).\n* The `check_voting_eligibility` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the person is eligible to vote. The `main` function uses this value to print out the result.",
