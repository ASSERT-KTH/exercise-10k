  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should randomly choose one of rock, paper, or scissors, and then ask the user for their choice. Determine the winner based on the game's rules",
  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Randomly selects the computer's choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(computer_choice, user_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if computer_choice == user_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (computer_choice == 'rock' and user_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (computer_choice == 'scissors' and user_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (computer_choice == 'paper' and user_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n    return \"User wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice.

Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n4. To quit the game, enter 'q' when prompted.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to select the computer's choice. For a more secure random number generator, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) like `secrets` in Python.",
