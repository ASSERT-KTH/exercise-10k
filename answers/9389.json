  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and calculates their GCD using the `math.gcd` function.\n2. The LCM is then calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b).\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_lcm` function by taking two numbers as input from the user and printing their LCM.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the LCM of 12 and 15: `calculate_lcm(12, 15)` returns 60.\n* Calculate the LCM of 24 and 30: `calculate_lcm(24, 30)` returns 120.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module or implement your own GCD function using the Euclidean algorithm.",
