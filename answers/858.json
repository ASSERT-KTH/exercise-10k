  "prompt": "Write a function that recursively traverses a data structure, such as a tree or graph, and performs an operation on each node.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that the specification describes:\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef traverse(root):\n    if not root:\n        return\n    print(root.val)  # Perform an operation on the node\n    traverse(root.left)  # Recursively traverse the left child\n    traverse(root.right)  # Recursively traverse the right child\n```\nThis code defines a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in a tree, and a `traverse` function that recursively traverses the tree and performs an operation on each node. The operation performed is simply printing the value of the node.",
