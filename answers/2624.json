  "answer": "**Personalized Greeting Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a person's name and age as input and generates a personalized greeting based on their age group.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_greeting(name: str, age: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a personalized greeting based on the person's age group.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The person's name.\n        age (int): The person's age.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A personalized greeting.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if age < 13:\n        return f\"Hello, young {name}!\"\n    elif 13 <= age < 20:\n        return f\"What's up, {name}?\"\n    elif 20 <= age < 65:\n        return f\"Hello, {name}! How's your day going?\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Hello, esteemed {name}!\"\n\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    greeting = generate_greeting(name, age)\n    print(greeting)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_greeting` function takes a `name` and `age` as input and returns a personalized greeting based on the age group.\n2. The age groups are defined as follows:\n\t* Young: under 13 years old\n\t* Teen: 13-19 years old\n\t* Adult: 20-64 years old\n\t* Senior: 65 years old and above\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input their name and age, generates the greeting using the `generate_greeting` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `John`, `25`\nOutput: `Hello, John! How's your day going?`\n* Input: `Jane`, `10`\nOutput: `Hello, young Jane!`\n* Input: `Bob`, `70`\nOutput: `Hello, esteemed Bob!`",
