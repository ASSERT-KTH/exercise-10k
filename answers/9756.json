  "answer": "**Circle Circumference Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The formula for the circumference of a circle is:\n\nC = 2\u03c0r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, \u03c0 is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\n    return circumference\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n        print(f\"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_circumference` that takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the circumference.\n2. The function uses the formula C = 2\u03c0r to calculate the circumference, where \u03c0 is obtained from the `math` module.\n3. The program includes a `main` function that demonstrates how to use the `calculate_circumference` function.\n4. The user is prompted to enter the radius of the circle, and the program calculates and prints the circumference.\n5. The program handles invalid input (negative radius) by raising a `ValueError` exception.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 5: `calculate_circumference(5)` returns approximately 31.42.\n* Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10: `calculate_circumference(10)` returns approximately 62.83.",
