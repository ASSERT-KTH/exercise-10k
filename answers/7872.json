  "answer": "Here's a Python program that analyzes a sentence and determines the number of words, vowels, and consonants:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a sentence and determines the number of words, vowels, and consonants.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence to be analyzed.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the word count, vowel count, and consonant count.\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    sentence = sentence.lower()\n    words = sentence.split()\n    word_count = len(words)\n    vowel_count = 0\n    consonant_count = 0\n\n    for char in sentence:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            if char in vowels:\n                vowel_count += 1\n            else:\n                consonant_count += 1\n\n    return word_count, vowel_count, consonant_count\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to test the analyze_sentence function.\n    \"\"\"\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    word_count, vowel_count, consonant_count = analyze_sentence(sentence)\n\n    print(\"Word Count:\", word_count)\n    print(\"Vowel Count:\", vowel_count)\n    print(\"Consonant Count:\", consonant_count)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `analyze_sentence` function takes a sentence as input and returns the word count, vowel count, and consonant count.\n*   It first converts the sentence to lowercase and splits it into words to count the number of words.\n*   It then iterates over each character in the sentence, checking if the character is an alphabet letter using the `isalpha` method.\n*   If the character is a letter, it checks if it's a vowel by checking if it's in the `vowels` string. If it is, it increments the vowel count; otherwise, it increments the consonant count.\n*   The `main` function tests the `analyze_sentence` function by prompting the user to enter a sentence and then printing the word count, vowel count, and consonant count.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n*   When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence.\n*   After entering a sentence, it will print the word count, vowel count, and consonant count.\n\nFor example, if you enter the sentence \"Hello World\", the output will be:\n\n```\nEnter a sentence: Hello World\nWord Count: 2\nVowel Count: 3\nConsonant Count: 7\n```",
