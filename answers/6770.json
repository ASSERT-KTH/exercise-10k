  "answer": "**Chatbot Program**\n====================\n### Overview\n\nThis program creates a simple chatbot that responds to user input and engages in a conversation. The chatbot uses a dictionary to map user inputs to predefined responses.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Dictionary of user inputs and corresponding chatbot responses\nresponses = {\n    'hello': ['Hi, how are you?', 'Hello! What can I help you with?', 'Hey, what\\'s up?'],\n    'how are you': ['I\\'m doing great, thanks!', 'I\\'m good, thanks for asking.', 'I\\'m fine, thanks.'],\n    'what is your name': ['My name is Chatbot.', 'I\\'m an AI chatbot.', 'You can call me Bot.'],\n    'default': ['I didn\\'t quite understand that.', 'Can you please rephrase?', 'Sorry, I\\'m not sure what you mean.']\n}\n\ndef chatbot_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Generate a chatbot response based on user input.\"\"\"\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return random.choice(responses[key])\n    return random.choice(responses['default'])\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot program!\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"User: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", chatbot_response(user_input))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program starts by defining a dictionary `responses` that maps user inputs to lists of possible chatbot responses.\n2. The `chatbot_response` function takes in user input, converts it to lowercase, and checks if it matches any of the keys in the `responses` dictionary. If a match is found, it returns a random response from the corresponding list.\n3. If no match is found, it returns a random response from the 'default' list.\n4. The `main` function runs the chatbot program in an infinite loop, prompting the user for input and printing the chatbot's response.\n5. The program exits when the user types 'quit'.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* User: hello\nChatbot: Hi, how are you?\n* User: how are you\nChatbot: I'm doing great, thanks!\n* User: what is your name\nChatbot: My name is Chatbot.\n* User: foo\nChatbot: I didn't quite understand that.\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and can be improved by adding more responses, using natural language processing techniques, or integrating with external APIs.",
