  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, the program provides a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help the user narrow down the range.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}. Thanks for playing!\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number. Try again!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will provide a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help the user narrow down the range.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to exit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they find the correct number or type \"quit\" to exit. The `random` module is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100.",
