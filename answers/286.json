  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the simple interest given the principal, rate, and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (float): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (as a percentage, e.g. 5 for 5%): \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: ${simple_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount after {time} years is: ${principal + simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the simple interest and the total amount after the specified time period.\n\n### Notes\n* The interest rate is assumed to be a percentage and should be entered as such (e.g. 5 for 5%).\n* The time period is assumed to be in years.\n* The program uses the formula for simple interest: `I = P * r * t`, where `I` is the interest, `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.",
