  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program simulates a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they guess the correct number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}. Thanks for playing!\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will tell them if their guess is too high or too low.\n4. The user can keep guessing until they find the correct number.\n5. The program will display the number of attempts it took the user to guess the correct number.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they guess the correct number or decide to quit.\n* The program uses a try-except block to handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values).\n* The program uses a conditional statement to check if the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low.\n* The program uses a `break` statement to exit the loop when the user guesses the correct number or decides to quit.",
