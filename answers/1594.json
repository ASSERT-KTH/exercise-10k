  "answer": "Here's a Python solution to count the occurrences of each letter in a string:\n\n```python\ndef count_letters(input_string):\n    # Create an empty dictionary\n    letter_count = {}\n\n    # Loop through each character in the string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is a letter\n        if char.isalpha():\n            # Convert the letter to lowercase\n            char = char.lower()\n            # If the letter is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n            if char in letter_count:\n                letter_count[char] += 1\n            # If the letter is not in the dictionary, add it\n            else:\n                letter_count[char] = 1\n\n    return letter_count\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(count_letters(input_string))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `letter_count` to store the count of each letter.\n2. We loop through each character in the input string.\n3. We check if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it's not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation), we skip it.\n4. We convert the letter to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure that we count 'A' and 'a' as the same letter.\n5. We check if the letter is already in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it is, we increment its count. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n6. Finally, we return the `letter_count` dictionary.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nFor the input string \"Hello, World!\", the output will be:\n```python\n{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}\n```\nThis shows that the letter 'l' appears 3 times, 'o' appears 2 times, and all other letters appear only once.",
