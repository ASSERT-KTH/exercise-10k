  "answer": "**Mode Function**\n================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the mode of a list of integers. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_mode(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the mode of a list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all are returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    counts = Counter(lst)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]\n\n    return modes\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(find_mode(numbers))  # Output: [4]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the list.\n2. It finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the values of the `Counter` object.\n3. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency by using a list comprehension to iterate over the items of the `Counter` object.\n4. Finally, it returns a list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all are returned.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function returns all modes if there are multiple. If you only want to return one mode, you can modify the function to return the first mode it finds. However, this may not be the desired behavior if there are multiple modes.",
