  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and an index as input, and modifies the element at that index to a specified value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that satisfies the provided specification:\n```python\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlst[2] = 6\nprint(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]\n```\nThis code creates a list `lst` with five elements, modifies the element at index 2 (third element) to the value 6, and then prints the modified list. The output will be `[1, 2, 6, 4, 5]`, as expected.",
