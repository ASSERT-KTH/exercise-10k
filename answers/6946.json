  "answer": "**Higher-Order Function Composition**\n=====================================\n\nIn this example, we will create a function that uses higher-order function composition to combine multiple functions. We will define a `compose` function that takes in multiple functions and returns a new function that applies each function in sequence.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef compose(*funcs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compose multiple functions together.\n\n    Args:\n        *funcs: Variable number of functions to compose.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new function that applies each function in sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    def composed(x):\n        result = x\n        for func in reversed(funcs):\n            result = func(result)\n        return result\n    return composed\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    \"\"\"Double the input.\"\"\"\n    return x * 2\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    \"\"\"Add one to the input.\"\"\"\n    return x + 1\n\ndef square(x):\n    \"\"\"Square the input.\"\"\"\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Compose the functions\ncomposed_func = compose(square, add_one, double)\n\n# Test the composed function\nprint(composed_func(5))  # Output: (5*2 + 1)^2 = 121\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `compose` function takes in a variable number of functions using the `*args` syntax.\n2. The `composed` function is defined inside `compose` and takes in a single input `x`.\n3. The `composed` function applies each function in the `funcs` list in reverse order, starting with the last function and working its way back to the first.\n4. Each function is applied to the result of the previous function, and the final result is returned.\n5. The `compose` function returns the `composed` function.\n6. In the example usage, we define three simple functions: `double`, `add_one`, and `square`.\n7. We compose these functions together using the `compose` function.\n8. We test the composed function by passing in an input value and printing the result.\n\n**Advantages**\n--------------\n\n1. **Modularity**: Higher-order function composition allows us to break down complex functions into smaller, reusable components.\n2. **Flexibility**: We can easily add or remove functions from the composition without modifying the underlying code.\n3. **Readability**: The composed function is easier to read and understand, as each component function has a clear and specific purpose.",
