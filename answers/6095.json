  "answer": "Insertion Sort Algorithm\n========================\n\nThe insertion sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. Each subsequent element from the unsorted region is inserted into the sorted region at its correct position.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the insertion sort algorithm using nested for loops in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are\n        # greater than key, to one position ahead\n        # of their current position\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", insertion_sort(arr))\n```\n\nExplanation\n-----------\n\n1.  The outer loop (`for i in range(1, len(arr))`) starts from the second element (index 1) and iterates through the entire list.\n2.  For each element, we store it in the `key` variable and initialize an inner loop (`while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]`) to shift larger elements to the right.\n3.  Inside the inner loop, we compare the `key` with the elements before it. If an element is greater than the `key`, we shift it to the right by assigning the value of `arr[j]` to `arr[j + 1]`.\n4.  We repeat this process until we find the correct position for the `key` or until we reach the beginning of the list.\n5.  Once we've found the correct position, we assign the `key` to `arr[j + 1]`, effectively inserting it into the sorted region.\n6.  We repeat this process for each element in the list, resulting in a sorted list in ascending order.\n\nTime Complexity\n---------------\n\nThe time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is:\n\n*   **Best-case:** O(n) when the input list is already sorted.\n*   **Average-case:** O(n^2) for random input lists.\n*   **Worst-case:** O(n^2) when the input list is reverse-sorted.\n\nSpace Complexity\n----------------\n\nThe space complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `key` and other temporary variables.",
