  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a given string. This function will help you locate specific text patterns within a larger text. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The main string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the substring is empty\n    # If it is, we return 0 because an empty string is technically a substring of every string\n    if not substring:\n        return 0\n\n    # Then, we use the built-in str.find() method in Python, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring\n    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1\n    # We store this result in the 'index' variable\n    index = string.find(substring)\n\n    # Finally, we return the index\n    return index\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(find_substring(\"Hello, World!\", \"World\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(find_substring(\"Hello, World!\", \"Universe\"))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_substring` takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`. It first checks if the `substring` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, as an empty string is considered a substring of every string.\n* The function utilizes Python's built-in `str.find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the `substring` in the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, it returns -1.\n* The result from `str.find()` is stored in the `index` variable and then returned by the function.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the `find_substring` function with different inputs, such as finding the index of \"World\" in \"Hello, World!\" or searching for a non-existent substring like \"Universe\".",
