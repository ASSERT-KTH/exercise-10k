  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a sequence of numbers as input and uses a loop to identify the longest increasing or decreasing subsequence. The program should output the type of subsequence (increasing or decreasing) and its length.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem. This program defines a function `longest_subsequence` that takes a sequence of numbers as input and returns the type of the longest subsequence and its length.\n\n```python\ndef longest_subsequence(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the longest increasing or decreasing subsequence in a given sequence of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    sequence (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the type of the longest subsequence and its length.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input sequence is empty\n    if not sequence:\n        return None, 0\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences\n    longest_increasing = [1] * len(sequence)\n    longest_decreasing = [1] * len(sequence)\n\n    # Iterate over the sequence to fill the longest_increasing and longest_decreasing lists\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If the current number is greater than the previous number, update the longest increasing subsequence\n            if sequence[i] > sequence[j]:\n                longest_increasing[i] = max(longest_increasing[i], longest_increasing[j] + 1)\n            # If the current number is less than the previous number, update the longest decreasing subsequence\n            elif sequence[i] < sequence[j]:\n                longest_decreasing[i] = max(longest_decreasing[i], longest_decreasing[j] + 1)\n\n    # Find the maximum length of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences\n    max_increasing = max(longest_increasing)\n    max_decreasing = max(longest_decreasing)\n\n    # Determine the type of the longest subsequence\n    if max_increasing >= max_decreasing:\n        return \"increasing\", max_increasing\n    else:\n        return \"decreasing\", max_decreasing\n\n\n# Example usage\nsequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1]\nsubsequence_type, length = longest_subsequence(sequence)\nprint(f\"The longest subsequence is {subsequence_type} with a length of {length}.\")\n```\n\nThis program works by iterating over the input sequence and maintaining two lists, `longest_increasing` and `longest_decreasing`, to store the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences ending at each position. It then compares these lengths to determine the type of the longest subsequence and returns the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input sequence, because it involves a nested loop structure. The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional lists used to store the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences.",
