  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a partition size as input and returns a new array containing the same elements partitioned into subarrays of the specified size.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfunction partition(arr, size) {\n  let result = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {\n    let chunk = arr.slice(i, i + size);\n    result.push(chunk);\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\nI've followed the step-by-step breakdown to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
