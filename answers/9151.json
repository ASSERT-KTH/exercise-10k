  "answer": "### Expression Evaluation with Multiple Operators\n\nHere is an example expression: `2 + 3 * 4 - 1`\n\nWe will evaluate this expression using Python.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression():\n    # Define the expression\n    expression = \"2 + 3 * 4 - 1\"\n\n    # Evaluate the expression\n    result = eval(expression)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The result of the expression '{expression}' is: {result}\")\n\n# Run the function\nevaluate_expression()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `evaluate_expression()` that contains the expression to be evaluated.\n2. We use the built-in `eval()` function to evaluate the expression. This function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.\n3. Finally, we print out the result of the expression.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the result of the expression `2 + 3 * 4 - 1`.\n\nNote: The `eval()` function can pose a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input, because it can evaluate any Python expression. In this case, since we are providing the expression ourselves, it is safe to use.\n\n#### Operator Precedence\n\nThe expression `2 + 3 * 4 - 1` is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. Multiply `3` and `4`: `3 * 4 = 12`\n2. Add `2` and `12`: `2 + 12 = 14`\n3. Subtract `1` from `14`: `14 - 1 = 13`\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression is `13`.",
