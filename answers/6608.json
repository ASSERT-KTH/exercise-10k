  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 5, each on a new line.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nLet me explain how this works:\n\n- The `range(1, 6)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, 6. This is why we use 6 instead of 5, because the upper limit in `range()` is exclusive.\n- The `for` loop then iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i` on each iteration.\n- The `print(i)` statement simply prints the current value of `i`, followed by a newline character (because that's the default behavior of `print()` in Python).\n\nIf you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\nEach number on a new line, as requested.",
