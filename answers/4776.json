  "prompt": "Write a program that checks the strength of a password. If the password has at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit, the password is 'Strong'. If the password has at least 6 characters, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one lowercase letter, the password is 'Medium'. If the password has less than 6 characters, the password is 'Weak'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks the strength of a password based on the given criteria:\n\n```python\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The strength of the password ('Strong', 'Medium', or 'Weak').\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize flags\n    has_uppercase = False\n    has_lowercase = False\n    has_digit = False\n\n    # Check for each character type\n    for char in password:\n        if char.isupper():\n            has_uppercase = True\n        elif char.islower():\n            has_lowercase = True\n        elif char.isdigit():\n            has_digit = True\n\n    # Check password strength\n    if len(password) >= 8 and has_uppercase and has_lowercase and has_digit:\n        return 'Strong'\n    elif len(password) >= 6 and has_uppercase and has_lowercase:\n        return 'Medium'\n    else:\n        return 'Weak'\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    strength = check_password_strength(password)\n    print(f\"The password '{password}' is {strength}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `check_password_strength` function takes a password as input and initializes flags to track the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the password, updating the flags as necessary.\n3. Based on the flags and the length of the password, it determines the password strength ('Strong', 'Medium', or 'Weak').\n4. The `main` function prompts the user for a password, checks its strength using the `check_password_strength` function, and prints the result.\n\nYou can run this program and test it with different passwords to see how it works.",
