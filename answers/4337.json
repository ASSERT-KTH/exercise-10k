  "answer": "**Array Difference Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two arrays. The difference of two arrays is defined as the elements that are in the first array but not in the second array, and the elements that are in the second array but not in the first array.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef array_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The difference between the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the arrays to sets for efficient lookups\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n\n    # Calculate the difference\n    diff = list(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))\n\n    return diff\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    diff = array_difference(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Difference:\", diff)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `array_difference` function takes two arrays as input and converts them to sets for efficient lookups.\n2. The `symmetric_difference` method is used to calculate the difference between the two sets.\n3. The result is converted back to a list and returned.\n4. In the example usage, two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are defined, and the `array_difference` function is called to calculate their difference.\n5. The result is printed to the console.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nDifference: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nNote that the order of the elements in the difference array is not guaranteed, as sets are unordered data structures. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach, such as using list comprehensions to calculate the difference.",
