  "answer": "### Partitioning a List of Integers into Even and Odd Numbers\n\nHere's a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef partition_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition a list of integers into two separate lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists: even numbers and odd numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n    return even_numbers, odd_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven, odd = partition_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `partition_numbers` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input.\n2. It uses list comprehensions to create two separate lists: `even_numbers` and `odd_numbers`.\n3. The `even_numbers` list includes all numbers from the input list where the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0 (`num % 2 == 0`).\n4. The `odd_numbers` list includes all numbers from the input list where the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not 0 (`num % 2 != 0`).\n5. The function returns a tuple containing both lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```",
