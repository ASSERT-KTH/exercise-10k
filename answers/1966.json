  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two input functions.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two input functions, helping you understand how to implement this concept in Python. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining a function that takes two functions as arguments.\ndef compose_functions(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function \n    that is the composition of the two input functions.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function to be composed.\n        func2 (function): The second function to be composed.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We define a new function inside our compose_functions function. This new function will be returned by compose_functions.\n    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # First, we apply func2 to the input arguments and keyword arguments.\n        result_of_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Then, we apply func1 to the result of func2.\n        result_of_func1 = func1(result_of_func2)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the result of func1.\n        return result_of_func1\n    \n    # We return the composed_function.\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\ncomposed = compose_functions(add_one, square)\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 26\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions, `func1` and `func2`, as arguments and returns a new function, `composed_function`, which represents the composition of `func1` and `func2`.\n* Inside `composed_function`, `func2` is applied to the input arguments and keyword arguments, and its result is then passed to `func1`.\n* The result of `func1` is returned as the output of `composed_function`, effectively creating a new function that combines the operations of `func1` and `func2`.\n* The example usage demonstrates this concept by composing `add_one` and `square` functions, showing how the composed function can be used to perform a series of operations on an input value.",
