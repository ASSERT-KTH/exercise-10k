  "answer": "**Collatz Conjecture Program**\n================================\n\nThe Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture that concerns a sequence defined as follows:\n\n* Start with any positive integer.\n* If the number is even, divide it by 2.\n* If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n* Repeat the process with the new number.\n\nThe conjecture states that no matter what value of the starting number, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n**Program Code**\n----------------\n\n```python\ndef collatz_conjecture(starting_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tests the Collatz Conjecture for a given starting number.\n\n    Args:\n        starting_number (int): The starting number for the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if starting_number <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Starting number must be a positive integer\")\n\n    sequence = [starting_number]\n    while starting_number != 1:\n        if starting_number % 2 == 0:\n            starting_number = starting_number // 2\n        else:\n            starting_number = 3 * starting_number + 1\n        sequence.append(starting_number)\n\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    starting_number = int(input(\"Enter a starting number: \"))\n    sequence = collatz_conjecture(starting_number)\n    print(\"Sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"Number of steps:\", len(sequence) - 1)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a starting number when prompted (e.g., 10).\n3. The program will print the sequence of numbers generated by the Collatz Conjecture and the number of steps it took to reach 1.\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `collatz_conjecture` function takes a starting number as input and initializes a list to store the sequence of numbers.\n2. The function uses a while loop to generate the sequence of numbers according to the Collatz Conjecture rules.\n3. The loop continues until the current number reaches 1.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a starting number, calls the `collatz_conjecture` function, and prints the resulting sequence and number of steps.",
