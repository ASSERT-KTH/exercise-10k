  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function to partition a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a given condition. This function will return the resulting partitioned dictionaries, helping you manage and organize your data more efficiently. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef partition_dict(input_dict, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns True or False.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple of two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains the key-value pairs for which the condition is True, \n               and the second dictionary contains the key-value pairs for which the condition is False.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two empty dictionaries to store the partitioned key-value pairs\n    dict_true = {}\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs for which the condition is False\n    dict_false = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        # Check the condition for the current key-value pair\n        if condition(key, value):\n            # If the condition is True, add the key-value pair to dict_true\n            dict_true[key] = value\n        else:\n            # If the condition is False, add the key-value pair to dict_false\n            dict_false[key] = value\n\n    # Return the two partitioned dictionaries as a tuple\n    return dict_true, dict_false\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a condition function that checks if the value is greater than 10\ndef condition(key, value):\n    return value > 10\n\n# Create a sample dictionary\nsample_dict = {'a': 5, 'b': 15, 'c': 8, 'd': 20}\n\n# Partition the dictionary using the condition function\ndict_true, dict_false = partition_dict(sample_dict, condition)\n\n# Print the partitioned dictionaries\nprint(\"Dictionary with values greater than 10:\", dict_true)\nprint(\"Dictionary with values less than or equal to 10:\", dict_false)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `partition_dict` takes two parameters: `input_dict` (the dictionary to be partitioned) and `condition` (a function that determines the partitioning criteria). It initializes two empty dictionaries, `dict_true` and `dict_false`, to store the partitioned key-value pairs.\n*   The function iterates over each key-value pair in `input_dict` using a `for` loop. For each pair, it applies the `condition` function to determine whether the pair should be added to `dict_true` or `dict_false`.\n*   After iterating over all key-value pairs, the function returns a tuple containing the two partitioned dictionaries, `dict_true` and `dict_false`.\n*   In the example usage, a condition function is defined to check if the value is greater than 10. A sample dictionary `sample_dict` is created and partitioned using the `partition_dict` function with the condition function. The resulting partitioned dictionaries are then printed to demonstrate the function's effectiveness.",
