  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to let the user guess a secret number between 1 and 10.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Secret Number Guessing Game\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the secret number\n    secret_number = 7  # You can change this number\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the Secret Number Guessing Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n\n    # Start the game loop\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"What's your guess? (or 'q' to quit): \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == 'q':\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the valid range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == secret_number:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the secret number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the secret number.\n6. Type 'q' to quit the game.\n\nThis program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they either find the secret number or choose to quit. It also includes input validation to ensure that the user's guess is a valid number between 1 and 10.",
