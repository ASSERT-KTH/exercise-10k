  "answer": "**Quotient Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient(dividend: float, divisor: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the quotient of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - dividend (float): The number being divided.\n    - divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The quotient of the two numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n    - ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend / divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the quotient\n        quotient = calculate_quotient(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The quotient is: {quotient}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor. The program will output `The quotient is: 5.0`.\n* Run the program and enter `10` as the dividend and `0` as the divisor. The program will output `Error: Cannot divide by zero`.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always check for division by zero to avoid runtime errors.\n* Use type hints to indicate the expected input and output types of your functions.\n* Use docstrings to document your functions and provide clear explanations of their behavior.",
