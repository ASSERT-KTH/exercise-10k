  "answer": "### UDP Socket Function\n#### Description\nThe following Python function utilizes the socket module to send and receive UDP packets. This function creates a UDP socket, binds it to a specified address and port, sends a UDP packet, and then waits for a response.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef send_and_receive_udp_packet(host, port, message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Send a UDP packet to a specified host and port, and then wait for a response.\n\n    Args:\n    - host (str): The host IP address to send the packet to.\n    - port (int): The port number to send the packet to.\n    - message (str): The message to be sent in the UDP packet.\n\n    Returns:\n    - response (str): The response received from the server.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a UDP socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to a local address and port\n    # This is optional, but it can be useful if you want to specify a local address and port\n    # sock.bind(('localhost', 12345))\n\n    # Send the UDP packet\n    sock.sendto(message.encode(), (host, port))\n\n    # Wait for a response from the server\n    response, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n\n    # Close the socket\n    sock.close()\n\n    # Return the response\n    return response.decode()\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost IP address\n    port = 12345        # Port number to send the packet to\n    message = 'Hello, server!'  # Message to be sent in the UDP packet\n\n    response = send_and_receive_udp_packet(host, port, message)\n    print(f'Response from server: {response}')\n```\n\n#### Creating a UDP Server\nTo test the above function, you need a UDP server that can receive and respond to UDP packets. Here's a simple UDP server example:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef create_udp_server(host, port):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a UDP server that listens for incoming UDP packets and responds to them.\n\n    Args:\n    - host (str): The host IP address to bind the server to.\n    - port (int): The port number to bind the server to.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a UDP socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to the specified host and port\n    sock.bind((host, port))\n\n    print(f'UDP server listening on {host}:{port}...')\n\n    while True:\n        # Wait for an incoming UDP packet\n        message, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n        print(f'Received message from {address}: {message.decode()}')\n\n        # Send a response back to the client\n        response = 'Hello, client!'\n        sock.sendto(response.encode(), address)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    host = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost IP address\n    port = 12345        # Port number to bind the server to\n\n    create_udp_server(host, port)\n```\n\nTo test the UDP client and server, run the server code first, and then run the client code. The client will send a UDP packet to the server, and the server will respond with a message. The client will then print out the response from the server.",
