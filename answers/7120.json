  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (Grade A), 80 <= score < 90 (Grade B), 70 <= score < 80 (Grade C), 60 <= score < 70 (Grade D), score < 60 (Grade F). Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int score;\n    cout << \"Enter your score: \";\n    cin >> score;\n\n    char grade = 'F';\n\n    if (score >= 90) {\n        grade = 'A';\n    } else if (score >= 80) {\n        grade = 'B';\n    } else if (score >= 70) {\n        grade = 'C';\n    } else if (score >= 60) {\n        grade = 'D';\n    } else {\n        grade = 'F';\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Your grade is: \" << grade << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It includes the necessary header file `iostream` and uses the `std` namespace.\n2. It declares the `main` function as the entry point of the program.\n3. It declares an integer variable `score` to store the user's input and a character variable `grade` to store the corresponding grade.\n4. It prompts the user to enter their score using `cout` and reads the input using `cin`.\n5. It uses a nested series of `if` statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n6. It outputs the calculated grade using `cout`.\n7. It returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.\n\nNote that the `else` clause in the last `if` statement is not strictly necessary, as the `grade` variable is already initialized to 'F'. However, it is included to make the code more explicit and easy to understand.",
