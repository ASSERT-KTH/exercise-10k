  "answer": "**Average Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of a student.\n\n    Args:\n    scores (dict): A dictionary where keys are subject names and values are scores.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_score = sum(scores.values())\n    average_grade = total_score / len(scores)\n    return average_grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of subjects\n    num_subjects = int(input(\"Enter the number of subjects: \"))\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store scores\n    scores = {}\n\n    # Get scores for each subject\n    for i in range(num_subjects):\n        subject = input(f\"Enter subject {i+1} name: \")\n        score = float(input(f\"Enter {subject} score: \"))\n        scores[subject] = score\n\n    # Calculate and display the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores)\n    print(f\"\\nAverage Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of subjects, subject names, and scores. The program will then calculate and display the average grade.\n\n```\nEnter the number of subjects: 3\nEnter subject 1 name: Math\nEnter Math score: 85\nEnter subject 2 name: Science\nEnter Science score: 90\nEnter subject 3 name: English\nEnter English score: 78\n\nAverage Grade: 84.33\n```\n\n### Advice\n* Make sure to enter valid scores (numbers between 0 and 100).\n* You can modify the program to handle different types of scores (e.g., letter grades) or add more features as needed.",
