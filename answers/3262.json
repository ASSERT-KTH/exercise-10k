Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Display available operations**: The program displays a list of available operations to the user.\n2. **Ask the user for an operation**: The program asks the user to choose an operation by entering a number between 1 and 5.\n3. **Check if the user wants to quit**: If the user chooses operation 5, the program terminates and displays a goodbye message.\n4. **Check if the user has entered a valid operation**: If the user enters an invalid operation, the program displays an error message and asks for an operation again.\n5. **Ask the user for two numbers**: The program asks the user to enter two numbers. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., a string instead of a number), the program displays an error message and asks for the numbers again.\n6. **Perform the chosen operation**: The program performs the chosen operation on the two numbers and displays the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and choose operation 1 (addition). Enter two numbers, such as 2 and 3. The program will display the result: `2 + 3 = 5`.\n* Run the program and choose operation 4 (division). Enter two numbers, such as 10 and 2. The program will display the result: `10 / 2 = 5.0`.\n* Run the program and choose operation 5 (quit). The program will terminate and display a goodbye message.",
