  "answer": "**Mode Calculation Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the mode of a given list of numbers. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, they are all returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    frequency = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of modes.\n2. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each number in the list.\n3. The maximum frequency is found using the `max` function.\n4. A list comprehension is used to find all numbers with the maximum frequency, which are the modes.\n5. In the `main` function, an example list of numbers is provided, and the `calculate_mode` function is called to find the mode(s).\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, the output will be `[3]`.\n* If the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, the output will be `[1, 2]`.\n* If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.",
