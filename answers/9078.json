  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that asks the user a series of survey questions and prints out the results using if statements:\n\n```python\n# Define the survey questions and answers\ndef survey():\n    print(\"Welcome to our survey! Please answer the following questions:\")\n    \n    # Question 1: How old are you?\n    age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n    \n    # Question 2: What is your favorite color?\n    color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n    \n    # Question 3: Do you like reading books?\n    reading = input(\"Do you like reading books? (yes/no) \")\n    \n    # Question 4: What is your favorite hobby?\n    hobby = input(\"What is your favorite hobby? \")\n    \n    # Print out the results\n    print(\"\\nHere are your survey results:\")\n    print(f\"Age: {age}\")\n    print(f\"Favorite color: {color}\")\n    \n    # Use if statement to determine if the user likes reading books\n    if reading.lower() == \"yes\":\n        print(\"You enjoy reading books.\")\n    elif reading.lower() == \"no\":\n        print(\"You do not enjoy reading books.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid response.\")\n        \n    # Use if statement to determine the user's favorite hobby\n    if hobby.lower() == \"sports\":\n        print(\"You enjoy playing sports.\")\n    elif hobby.lower() == \"music\":\n        print(\"You enjoy listening to music.\")\n    elif hobby.lower() == \"hiking\":\n        print(\"You enjoy hiking outdoors.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Your favorite hobby is {hobby}.\")\n        \n    # Use if statement to determine the user's age group\n    if age < 18:\n        print(\"You are a minor.\")\n    elif age < 65:\n        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are a senior.\")\n\n# Call the survey function\nsurvey()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We define a function called `survey()` that contains all the survey questions and answers.\n2. We ask the user to input their age, favorite color, whether they like reading books, and their favorite hobby.\n3. We use if statements to determine the user's answers and print out the results.\n4. For the \"Do you like reading books?\" question, we use an if statement to check if the user's response is \"yes\" or \"no\".\n5. For the \"What is your favorite hobby?\" question, we use an if statement to check if the user's response is \"sports\", \"music\", or \"hiking\".\n6. For the age question, we use an if statement to determine the user's age group (minor, adult, or senior).\n7. Finally, we call the `survey()` function to run the survey.\n\nNote that this is a simple example and you can add more questions and if statements as needed. Also, you can use more advanced techniques such as using dictionaries or lists to store the survey questions and answers.",
