  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a single line of input from the user and prints it back out.",
  "answer": "Based on the detailed specification you provided, here is the code that meets all the requirements:\n```\ndef print_single_line():\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a single line of input: \")\n    print(user_input)\n\nprint_single_line()\n```\nThis code defines a function `print_single_line` that reads a single line of input from the user using the `input` function, stores it in the `user_input` variable, and then prints it back out using the `print` function. The function is then called once with no arguments.\n\nNote that I've added a prompt to the `input` function to make it clear what the user should enter. You can modify this prompt to suit your needs.",
