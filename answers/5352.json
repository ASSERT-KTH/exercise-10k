  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a target value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the list, or -1 if the target value is not found.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef searchInsert(nums, target):\n    if target in nums:\n        return nums.index(target)\n    else:\n        nums.append(target)\n        nums.sort()\n        return nums.index(target)\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 3, 5, 6]\ntarget = 5\nprint(searchInsert(nums, target))  # Output: 2\n```\nNote that I've used the `index()` method to find the index of the target value in the list, and the `sort()` method to sort the list in ascending order. I've also used the `in` operator to check if the target value is already in the list.",
