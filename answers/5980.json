  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list that contains the elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses list comprehension to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\ndef difference_list(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing elements that are in list1 but not in list2.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first list.\n    list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing elements that are in list1 but not in list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]\n\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nresult = difference_list(list1, list2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the first list and checking if it's not in the second list. If it's not, it's included in the new list. The result is a list containing all elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `set` data structure to achieve the same result more efficiently, especially for large lists:\n\n```python\ndef difference_list(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing elements that are in list1 but not in list2.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first list.\n    list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing elements that are in list1 but not in list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1) - set(list2))\n\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nresult = difference_list(list1, list2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis version of the function converts both lists to sets, subtracts the second set from the first, and then converts the resulting set back to a list. Note that this method does not preserve the original order of elements, as sets are unordered data structures.",
