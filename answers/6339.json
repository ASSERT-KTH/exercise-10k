  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, finds their intersection, and returns the intersection array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    std::cin >> n >> m;\n    int arr1[n], arr2[m];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        std::cin >> arr1[i];\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        std::cin >> arr2[i];\n    }\n    int l = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {\n                std::cout << arr1[i] << \" \";\n                l++;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (l == 0) {\n        std::cout << -1;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI have followed the specification exactly, using the same variable names, data types, and logic. The program reads the input, finds the intersection of the two arrays, and prints the intersection array. If there is no intersection, it prints -1.",
