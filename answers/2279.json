  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\ngcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The greatest common divisor of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", gcd)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two numbers as input, `a` and `b`.\n*   It uses a while loop to continuously apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0.\n*   Inside the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes the old `b` and `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n*   Once `b` becomes 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD.\n*   The user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the `calculate_gcd` function is called with these numbers.\n*   The calculated GCD is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18:\n    *   Input: `num1 = 48`, `num2 = 18`\n    *   Output: `The greatest common divisor of 48 and 18 is 6`\n*   Calculate the GCD of 54 and 24:\n    *   Input: `num1 = 54`, `num2 = 24`\n    *   Output: `The greatest common divisor of 54 and 24 is 6`",
