  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses nested for loops to print a pyramid pattern of asterisks:\n\n```python\ndef print_pyramid(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pyramid pattern of asterisks of height n.\n    \n    Args:\n    n (int): The height of the pyramid.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n        \n        # Print asterisks\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        \n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\n# Test the function\nprint_pyramid(5)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print a pyramid pattern of asterisks with a height of 5. The output will look like this:\n```\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1.  The outer loop (`for i in range(n)`) iterates over each row of the pyramid.\n2.  The first inner loop (`for j in range(n - i - 1)`) prints the leading spaces for each row. The number of spaces decreases as you move down the pyramid.\n3.  The second inner loop (`for k in range(2 * i + 1)`) prints the asterisks for each row. The number of asterisks increases as you move down the pyramid, with each row having one more asterisk than the previous row on each side.\n4.  Finally, the `print()` function is called without any arguments to move to the next line after printing each row.\n\nYou can adjust the height of the pyramid by passing a different value to the `print_pyramid` function. For example, `print_pyramid(3)` would print a pyramid with a height of 3.",
