  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if the game has been won.\"\"\"\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combo[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the game.\"\"\"\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    current_player = \"X\"\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(f\"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Player {result} wins!\")\n            break\n        current_player = \"O\" if current_player == \"X\" else \"X\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. The `print_board` function prints the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n2. The `check_win` function checks if the game has been won by either player or if it's a tie.\n3. In the `main` function, the game loop continues until a player wins or it's a tie.\n4. Inside the loop, the current state of the board is printed, and the current player is asked for their move.\n5. The move is validated to ensure it's a valid position on the board and that the position is empty.\n6. The move is applied to the board, and the `check_win` function is called to check if the game has been won.\n7. If the game has been won, the final state of the board is printed, and a message is displayed announcing the winner or a tie.\n8. If the game has not been won, the current player is switched, and the loop continues.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo run the program, simply execute the script. The game will guide you through each step, asking for input when it's your turn. For example:\n```\n  X |   |  \n---+---+---\n   | O |  \n---+---+---\n   |   |  \nPlayer X, enter your move (1-9): 3\n```",
