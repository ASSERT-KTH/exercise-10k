  "answer": "Here's a Python program that searches for a character in a given string using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef search_character(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a character in a given string using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string to search in.\n        char (str): The character to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the character if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(string):\n        if string[index] == char:\n            return index\n        index += 1\n    return -1\n\n\ndef main():\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character to search for: \")\n\n    result = search_character(string, char)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `search_character` function takes a `string` and a `char` as input and returns the index of the character if found, -1 otherwise.\n*   It uses a while loop to iterate through the string, comparing each character with the target character.\n*   If a match is found, the function returns the index of the character.\n*   If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1, indicating that the character is not in the string.\n*   The `main` function gets user input for the string and character, calls the `search_character` function, and prints the result.",
