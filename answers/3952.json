  "answer": "**Total Bill Calculator Program**\n====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total bill for a customer based on their purchases. It takes into account the price and quantity of each item, as well as any applicable taxes and discounts.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define a class to represent a purchase item\nclass PurchaseItem:\n    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):\n        self.name = name\n        self.price = price\n        self.quantity = quantity\n\n# Define a function to calculate the total bill\ndef calculate_total_bill(items, tax_rate, discount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total bill based on the purchase items, tax rate, and discount.\n\n    Args:\n        items (list): List of PurchaseItem objects\n        tax_rate (float): Tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08)\n        discount (float): Discount as a decimal (e.g., 10% = 0.10)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total bill amount\n    \"\"\"\n    subtotal = sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)\n    tax = subtotal * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = subtotal * discount\n    total = subtotal + tax - discount_amount\n    return total\n\n# Define a main function to demonstrate the program\ndef main():\n    # Create a list of purchase items\n    items = [\n        PurchaseItem(\"Item 1\", 10.99, 2),\n        PurchaseItem(\"Item 2\", 5.99, 3),\n        PurchaseItem(\"Item 3\", 7.99, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Set the tax rate and discount\n    tax_rate = 0.08  # 8% tax rate\n    discount = 0.10  # 10% discount\n\n    # Calculate the total bill\n    total_bill = calculate_total_bill(items, tax_rate, discount)\n\n    # Print the receipt\n    print(\"Receipt:\")\n    for item in items:\n        print(f\"{item.name} x {item.quantity} = ${item.price * item.quantity:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Subtotal: ${sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items):.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax ({tax_rate*100}%): ${sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items) * tax_rate:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount ({discount*100}%): -${sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items) * discount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total: ${total_bill:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply create a list of `PurchaseItem` objects, set the tax rate and discount, and call the `calculate_total_bill` function. The program will calculate the total bill and print a receipt.\n\nFor example, the `main` function demonstrates how to create a list of purchase items, set the tax rate and discount, and print a receipt.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nReceipt:\nItem 1 x 2 = $21.98\nItem 2 x 3 = $17.97\nItem 3 x 1 = $7.99\nSubtotal: $47.94\nTax (8.00%): $3.84\nDiscount (10.00%): -$4.79\nTotal: $46.99\n```",
