  "answer": "**Meal Cost Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of a meal, including a tip, given the cost of the meal and the tip percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a meal, including a tip.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal, including the tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * meal_cost\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n\n    return total_cost\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the meal cost from the user\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Meal Cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip ({tip_percentage}%): ${((tip_percentage / 100) * meal_cost):.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal when prompted (e.g., `20.00`).\n3. Enter the tip percentage when prompted (e.g., `15`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the total cost of the meal, including the tip.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nEnter the cost of the meal: $20.00\nEnter the tip percentage (%): 15\nMeal Cost: $20.00\nTip (15.0%): $3.00\nTotal Cost: $23.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a function `calculate_total_cost` to encapsulate the calculation logic.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output.\n* The program uses f-strings to format the output with two decimal places.",
