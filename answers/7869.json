  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on a set of conditional statements.\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the following rules:\n    - If the number is even, the next number is the current number divided by 2.\n    - If the number is odd, the next number is the current number multiplied by 3 and then added by 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [n]\n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            n = n * 3 + 1\n        sequence.append(n)\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(\"Sequence starting from\", n, \":\", generate_sequence(n))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `generate_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a list `sequence` with `n` as its first element.\n2. The function enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1.\n3. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is even by using the modulo operator (`n % 2 == 0`).\n   - If `n` is even, the next number in the sequence is calculated by dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`n // 2`).\n   - If `n` is odd, the next number in the sequence is calculated by multiplying `n` by 3 and adding 1 (`n * 3 + 1`).\n4. The newly calculated number is appended to the `sequence` list.\n5. Once the loop exits, the function returns the generated sequence.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo generate a sequence starting from 10, call the `generate_sequence` function with `n = 10` as shown in the example usage section. The output will be the sequence of numbers generated based on the conditional rules.",
