  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list that are divisible by 3 or 5. The function should take a list of integers as input and return the sum of the numbers that meet the condition.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list that meet a specific condition. This function will take a list of integers as input and return the sum of the numbers that are divisible by certain numbers. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef sum_divisible_by_three_or_five(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all numbers in a list that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0, this will store the sum of the numbers that meet the condition\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is divisible by 3 or 5\n        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:\n            # If the number is divisible, add it to the total sum\n            total_sum += num\n\n    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sum_divisible_by_three_or_five` initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the numbers that meet the condition.\n* It then iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`, checking if `num` is divisible by 3 or 5 using the modulus operator `%`.\n* If `num` is divisible, it is added to `total_sum`.\n* Finally, the function returns `total_sum` after iterating over all numbers in the list.",
