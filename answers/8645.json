  "answer": "**Finding the Index of an Element in a List**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `find_index`, takes in a list and an element as input and returns the index of the element in the list. If the element is not found in the list, it returns `-1`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of a given element in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        elem: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element in the list, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(elem)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(find_index(my_list, 3))  # Output: 2\n    print(find_index(my_list, 6))  # Output: -1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the given element. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError` exception, which we catch and handle by returning `-1`.\n\nNote that this function only returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. If you need to find the indices of all occurrences, you would need to use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension with the `enumerate` function.",
