  "answer": "**Merging Two Sorted Arrays**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from both input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n\n\ndef merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array efficiently.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from both input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            result.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in arr1, append them to the result\n    while i < len(arr1):\n        result.append(arr1[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in arr2, append them to the result\n    while j < len(arr2):\n        result.append(arr2[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n    print(\"Merging using built-in sort:\")\n    print(merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))\n\n    print(\"\\nMerging efficiently:\")\n    print(merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code provides two functions to merge two sorted arrays:\n\n1.  `merge_sorted_arrays`: This function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). It concatenates the two input arrays and then sorts the resulting array.\n2.  `merge_sorted_arrays_efficient`: This function merges the two sorted arrays efficiently by comparing elements from both arrays and appending the smaller element to the result array. It has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays.\n\nIn the example usage, we demonstrate how to use both functions to merge two sorted arrays, `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. The output will be the merged sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.",
