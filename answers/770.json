  "answer": "**Variable Swap Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. It achieves this by utilizing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n    \n    Args:\n    a (int): The first variable.\n    b (int): The second variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Print original values\n    print(f\"Original values: a = {a}, b = {b}\")\n    \n    # Swap values using arithmetic operations\n    a = a + b  # a now holds the sum of a and b\n    b = a - b  # b now holds the original value of a\n    a = a - b  # a now holds the original value of b\n    \n    # Print swapped values\n    print(f\"Swapped values: a = {a}, b = {b}\")\n    \n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    a = 5\n    b = 10\n    swap_variables(a, b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `swap_variables` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2.  It prints the original values of `a` and `b`.\n3.  The function then uses arithmetic operations to swap the values:\n    *   `a = a + b` calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to `a`.\n    *   `b = a - b` calculates the difference between the new `a` (sum of original `a` and `b`) and `b`, effectively giving the original value of `a`. This value is assigned to `b`.\n    *   `a = a - b` calculates the difference between the new `a` (sum of original `a` and `b`) and the new `b` (original value of `a`), effectively giving the original value of `b`. This value is assigned to `a`.\n4.  Finally, the function prints the swapped values and returns them as a tuple.\n\n### Note\n\nWhile this approach works, it may cause issues with overflow for large values of `a` and `b`. A more modern and Pythonic way to swap variables without using a temporary variable is to use tuple unpacking: `a, b = b, a`. This method is more efficient, readable, and safe.",
