  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock Paper Scissors with the user, using conditional statements to determine the winner.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that plays Rock Paper Scissors with the user:\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Function to generate computer's move\ndef get_computer_move():\n    moves = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(moves)\n\n# Function to determine the winner\ndef get_winner(user_move, computer_move):\n    if user_move == computer_move:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_move == 'rock' and computer_move == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_move == 'paper' and computer_move == 'rock') or \\\n         (user_move == 'scissors' and computer_move == 'paper'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\n# Main function\ndef play_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_move = input(\"Enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_move not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid move. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_move = get_computer_move()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_move}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_move}\\n\")\n        print(get_winner(user_move, computer_move))\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != 'yes':\n            break\n\n# Run the game\nplay_game()\n```\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `get_computer_move` function generates a random move for the computer.\n2. The `get_winner` function determines the winner based on the user's move and the computer's move. It uses conditional statements to check for ties, wins, and losses.\n3. The `play_game` function is the main function that controls the game flow. It prompts the user for their move, generates the computer's move, displays the results, and asks the user if they want to play again.\n\nExample use case:\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\nEnter your move (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nYou win!\n\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): yes\nEnter your move (rock, paper, or scissors): paper\n\nYou chose: paper\nComputer chose: rock\n\nYou win!\n\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): no\n```\nNote: This program uses a simple `random` module to generate the computer's move. You can modify the program to use a more sophisticated algorithm if you want.",
