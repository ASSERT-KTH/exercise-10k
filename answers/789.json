  "answer": "**Mortgage Payment Calculator Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program calculates the monthly mortgage payment given the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mortgage_payment(loan_amount, interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly mortgage payment.\n\n    Args:\n        loan_amount (float): The loan amount.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        years (int): The number of years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly mortgage payment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert annual interest rate to monthly interest rate\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n\n    # Calculate the number of months\n    months = years * 12\n\n    # Calculate the monthly mortgage payment\n    monthly_payment = (loan_amount * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** months) / ((1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** months - 1)\n\n    return monthly_payment\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    loan_amount = float(input(\"Enter the loan amount: \"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in percent): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the monthly mortgage payment\n    monthly_payment = calculate_mortgage_payment(loan_amount, interest_rate, years)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The monthly mortgage payment is: ${monthly_payment:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years. The program will then calculate and print the monthly mortgage payment.\n\nFor example, if you enter a loan amount of $200,000, an annual interest rate of 4%, and a term of 30 years, the program will output:\n\n```\nThe monthly mortgage payment is: $955.66\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThis program uses the formula for calculating the monthly mortgage payment, which is:\n\nM = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n \u2013 1]\n\nWhere:\n\n* M is the monthly payment\n* P is the loan amount\n* i is the monthly interest rate\n* n is the number of months\n\nThe program first converts the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate by dividing by 12. It then calculates the number of months by multiplying the number of years by 12. Finally, it uses the formula to calculate the monthly mortgage payment and prints the result.",
