  "prompt": "Create a dictionary with names of colors as keys and their hex codes as values. Remove a specific key-value pair from the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python code snippet that does exactly that:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary of colors and their hex codes\ncolors = {\n    \"red\": \"#FF0000\",\n    \"green\": \"#00FF00\",\n    \"blue\": \"#0000FF\",\n    \"yellow\": \"#FFFF00\",\n    \"purple\": \"#FF00FF\"\n}\n\n# Print the original dictionary\nprint(\"Original Dictionary:\")\nprint(colors)\n\n# Remove a specific key-value pair from the dictionary\nkey_to_remove = \"green\"\nif key_to_remove in colors:\n    del colors[key_to_remove]\nelse:\n    print(f\"The key '{key_to_remove}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Print the updated dictionary\nprint(\"\\nUpdated Dictionary:\")\nprint(colors)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a dictionary called `colors` with color names as keys and their corresponding hex codes as values.\n2.  We print the original dictionary to show its contents before modification.\n3.  We specify the key we want to remove (`\"green\"` in this case) and check if it exists in the dictionary using an `if` statement.\n4.  If the key exists, we use the `del` statement to remove the key-value pair from the dictionary. If the key doesn't exist, we print a message indicating that the key is not found.\n5.  Finally, we print the updated dictionary to show the result after removing the specified key-value pair.",
