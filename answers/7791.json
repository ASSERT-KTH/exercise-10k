  "answer": "Here is a simple program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nIf you want to make it a bit more structured, here is a version with a `main` function:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nYou can save this to a file (e.g., `hello.py`) and run it with Python (e.g., `python hello.py`) to see the output.",
