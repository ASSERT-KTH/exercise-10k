  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a mapping function as input, and returns a new list containing the results of applying the mapping function to each element of the original list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef map_list(lst, func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list containing the results.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        func (function): The function to apply to each element.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the results of applying the function to each element.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for i in lst:\n        result.append(func(i))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndoubled_numbers = map_list(numbers, double)\nprint(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\nNote that I've followed the specification exactly, including the docstring, function signature, and example usage. Let me know if you have any further requests!",
