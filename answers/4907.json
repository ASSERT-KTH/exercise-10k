  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's age as input and prints whether they are eligible to vote (18 or older) or not.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n# Call the function\ncheck_voting_eligibility()\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1. We define a function `check_voting_eligibility()` that takes no arguments.\n2. Inside the function, we prompt the user to enter their age using the `input()` function and convert it to an integer using `int()`.\n3. We then use an `if-else` statement to check if the user's age is 18 or older. If it is, we print a message stating that they are eligible to vote. Otherwise, we print a message stating that they are not eligible to vote.\n4. Finally, we call the `check_voting_eligibility()` function to execute the program.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `voting_eligibility.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python voting_eligibility.py`). Then, follow the prompt to enter your age.",
