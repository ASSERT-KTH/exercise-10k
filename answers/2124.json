  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that extracts a subset of elements from a list based on given indices. This function will return a new list containing the elements between the specified indices. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and two indices as input and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list.\n        start_index (int): The starting index.\n        end_index (int): The ending index.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the elements between the two indices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a list and the indices are integers\n    if not isinstance(input_list, list) or not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list and indices must be integers\")\n\n    # Then, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index\n    if start_index > end_index:\n        raise ValueError(\"Start index must be less than or equal to end index\")\n\n    # We also need to check if the start and end indices are within the bounds of the list\n    if start_index < 0 or end_index > len(input_list):\n        raise IndexError(\"Indices out of range\")\n\n    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to get the elements between the two indices\n    # The slicing operation will return a new list containing the elements from the start index up to but not including the end index\n    new_list = input_list[start_index:end_index]\n\n    # Finally, we return the new list\n    return new_list\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `slice_list` starts by validating the input types to ensure `input_list` is a list and `start_index` and `end_index` are integers. It raises a `TypeError` if these conditions are not met.\n* It then checks if `start_index` is less than or equal to `end_index` and if both indices are within the bounds of `input_list`, raising a `ValueError` or `IndexError` accordingly.\n* The function utilizes Python's list slicing feature to create a new list (`new_list`) containing the elements from `start_index` up to but not including `end_index` in `input_list`.\n* Finally, it returns `new_list`, which contains the desired subset of elements from the original list.",
