  "prompt": "Write a program that accesses and prints the first and last elements of an array",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that creates an array and prints its first and last elements:\n\n```python\n# Define the array\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Check if the array is not empty\nif len(my_array) > 0:\n    # Print the first element\n    print(\"First element: \", my_array[0])\n    \n    # Print the last element\n    print(\"Last element: \", my_array[-1])\nelse:\n    print(\"The array is empty.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines an array `my_array` and checks if it's not empty. If it's not empty, it prints the first element (at index 0) and the last element (at index -1, which is a Python shorthand for the last element). If the array is empty, it prints a corresponding message. \n\nYou can replace `my_array` with your own array. This code works with arrays of any size and with any type of elements (not just integers). \n\nNote that in Python, arrays are typically referred to as lists. The `array` module does provide a type called `array`, but it's not as commonly used as lists. The code above works with lists, not with the `array` type from the `array` module. \n\nIf you are working with the `array` type from the `array` module, the code would be similar, but you would need to import the `array` module and create an `array` object instead of a list:\n\n```python\nimport array\n\n# Define the array\nmy_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Check if the array is not empty\nif len(my_array) > 0:\n    # Print the first element\n    print(\"First element: \", my_array[0])\n    \n    # Print the last element\n    print(\"Last element: \", my_array[-1])\nelse:\n    print(\"The array is empty.\")\n```",
