  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent of a given number using the math library:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hyperbolic_functions(x):\n    # Calculate hyperbolic sine\n    sinh_x = (math.exp(x) - math.exp(-x)) / 2\n    # Calculate hyperbolic cosine\n    cosh_x = (math.exp(x) + math.exp(-x)) / 2\n    # Calculate hyperbolic tangent\n    if cosh_x == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero in calculating hyperbolic tangent.\")\n        return None, None, None\n    else:\n        tanh_x = sinh_x / cosh_x\n    return sinh_x, cosh_x, tanh_x\n\ndef main():\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    sinh_x, cosh_x, tanh_x = calculate_hyperbolic_functions(num)\n    if sinh_x is not None:\n        print(f\"The hyperbolic sine of {num} is: {sinh_x}\")\n        print(f\"The hyperbolic cosine of {num} is: {cosh_x}\")\n        print(f\"The hyperbolic tangent of {num} is: {tanh_x}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program asks the user for a number, calculates the hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent of that number, and then prints the results. It uses the `math.exp()` function to calculate the exponential of `x` and `-x`, and then uses these values to calculate the hyperbolic functions. \n\nThe hyperbolic functions are calculated using the following formulas:\n\n*   `sinh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2`\n*   `cosh(x) = (exp(x) + exp(-x)) / 2`\n*   `tanh(x) = sinh(x) / cosh(x)`\n\nNote that the hyperbolic tangent is not defined when the hyperbolic cosine is zero. However, since `cosh(x)` is never zero for any real number `x`, this is not a concern in practice.",
