  "prompt": "Create a function called calculate_gpa that takes a dictionary of courses with their respective grades as input. The function should calculate the grade point average based on the given grades. Assume that A grade is 4 points, B grade is 3 points, C grade is 2 points, D grade is 1 point, and F grade is 0 points.",
  "answer": "### Grade Point Average Calculator Function\n#### Description\nThe `calculate_gpa` function calculates the grade point average (GPA) based on a dictionary of courses with their respective grades.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade point average (GPA) based on a dictionary of courses with their respective grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are course names and values are grades (A, B, C, D, F).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated GPA.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input dictionary is empty or if a grade is not one of the expected values (A, B, C, D, F).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the grade point mapping\n    grade_points = {\n        'A': 4,\n        'B': 3,\n        'C': 2,\n        'D': 1,\n        'F': 0\n    }\n\n    # Check if the input dictionary is empty\n    if not grades:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input dictionary cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Initialize the total points and course count\n    total_points = 0\n    course_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the courses and grades\n    for course, grade in grades.items():\n        # Check if the grade is valid\n        if grade not in grade_points:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid grade '{grade}' for course '{course}'\")\n\n        # Add the grade points to the total\n        total_points += grade_points[grade]\n        course_count += 1\n\n    # Calculate the GPA\n    gpa = total_points / course_count if course_count > 0 else 0\n\n    return gpa\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    grades = {\n        \"Math\": \"A\",\n        \"Science\": \"B\",\n        \"English\": \"A\",\n        \"History\": \"C\"\n    }\n\n    try:\n        gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)\n        print(f\"GPA: {gpa:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gpa` function takes a dictionary of courses with their respective grades as input.\n*   It uses a predefined mapping to convert grades to grade points (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0).\n*   The function calculates the total points by summing the grade points for each course and then divides by the total number of courses to get the GPA.\n*   It includes error handling to ensure the input dictionary is not empty and that all grades are valid.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `calculate_gpa` function with a sample dictionary of grades and print the calculated GPA.",
