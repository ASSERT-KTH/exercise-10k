  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Function to get two numbers from the user and print their sum\ndef print_sum():\n    # Get the first number from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n    # Get the second number from the user\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum of the two numbers\n    print(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", num1 + num2)\n\n# Call the function\nprint_sum()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `print_sum()` that prompts the user to enter two numbers. The numbers are stored in the variables `num1` and `num2`. We then calculate the sum of these two numbers and print the result.\n\nTo run this program, you can save it in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `sum_program.py`) and run it using Python (for example, `python sum_program.py` in the terminal). When you run the program, it will ask you to enter two numbers, and then it will print their sum.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the first number: 5\nEnter the second number: 7\nThe sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is: 12.0\n```",
