  "answer": "**Sentence Repeater Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a sentence and then repeats it back to them.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef repeat_sentence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a sentence and repeats it back to them.\n    \"\"\"\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")\n    print(\"You entered:\", sentence)\n\ndef main():\n    repeat_sentence()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a sentence (e.g., \"Hello, world!\").\n3. The program will repeat the sentence back to you.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `repeat_sentence` function uses the `input` function to ask the user for a sentence.\n2. The user's input is stored in the `sentence` variable.\n3. The program then prints out the sentence using the `print` function.\n4. The `main` function calls the `repeat_sentence` function to start the program.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).",
