  "answer": "**Simple Chatbot Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that acts as a chatbot and responds to basic user queries using if statements.\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport datetime\n\n# Define a function to get the current time\ndef get_current_time():\n    return datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M\")\n\n# Define a function to get the current date\ndef get_current_date():\n    return datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# Define the main function for the chatbot\ndef chatbot():\n    print(\"Welcome to the simple chatbot!\")\n    print(\"Type 'exit' to quit the chatbot.\")\n\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"User: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to exit the chatbot\n        if user_input.lower() == \"exit\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        # Check if the user is asking for the current time\n        elif \"time\" in user_input.lower():\n            print(f\"Current time: {get_current_time()}\")\n\n        # Check if the user is asking for the current date\n        elif \"date\" in user_input.lower():\n            print(f\"Current date: {get_current_date()}\")\n\n        # Check if the user is asking for their name\n        elif \"name\" in user_input.lower():\n            print(\"I don't know your name. Please tell me!\")\n\n        # Check if the user is telling their name\n        elif \"my name is\" in user_input.lower():\n            name = user_input.split(\"is \")[1]\n            print(f\"Nice to meet you, {name}!\")\n\n        # Check if the user is asking for help\n        elif \"help\" in user_input.lower():\n            print(\"Available commands:\")\n            print(\"  - time: Get the current time\")\n            print(\"  - date: Get the current date\")\n            print(\"  - name: Tell me your name\")\n\n        # If none of the above conditions are met, respond with a default message\n        else:\n            print(\"I didn't understand that. Please try again!\")\n\n# Run the chatbot\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    chatbot()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   User: What is the current time?\n    Chatbot: Current time: 14:30\n*   User: What is the current date?\n    Chatbot: Current date: 2024-09-16\n*   User: My name is John.\n    Chatbot: Nice to meet you, John!\n*   User: Help\n    Chatbot: Available commands:\n        - time: Get the current time\n        - date: Get the current date\n        - name: Tell me your name\n\n**Notes**\n-----\n\n*   This is a very basic chatbot and does not understand natural language.\n*   The chatbot only responds to specific keywords and phrases.\n*   The chatbot does not have any memory, so it will not remember the user's name or any other information.",
