  "answer": "**Tower of Hanoi Puzzle Solution**\n=====================================\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving disks from one peg to another, subject to the following rules:\n\n* Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n**Program Implementation**\n-------------------------\n\nThe following Python program uses recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef tower_of_hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle by moving n disks from the from_peg to the to_peg.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of disks.\n        from_peg (str): The peg where the disks are initially located.\n        to_peg (str): The peg where the disks need to be moved.\n        aux_peg (str): The auxiliary peg used to facilitate the move.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        # Base case: move a single disk from the from_peg to the to_peg.\n        print(f\"Move disk 1 from {from_peg} to {to_peg}\")\n        return\n\n    # Move n-1 disks from the from_peg to the aux_peg, using the to_peg as a temporary storage.\n    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, from_peg, aux_peg, to_peg)\n\n    # Move the nth disk from the from_peg to the to_peg.\n    print(f\"Move disk {n} from {from_peg} to {to_peg}\")\n\n    # Move the n-1 disks from the aux_peg to the to_peg, using the from_peg as a temporary storage.\n    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, aux_peg, to_peg, from_peg)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the number of disks and the pegs.\n    n = 3\n    from_peg = \"A\"\n    to_peg = \"C\"\n    aux_peg = \"B\"\n\n    # Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n    print(f\"Solving Tower of Hanoi puzzle with {n} disks:\")\n    tower_of_hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nThe provided `main` function demonstrates how to use the `tower_of_hanoi` function to solve the puzzle with 3 disks. You can modify the `n`, `from_peg`, `to_peg`, and `aux_peg` variables to suit your specific needs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**\n---------------------------\n\n1.  Define the `tower_of_hanoi` function, which takes four arguments: the number of disks (`n`), the initial peg (`from_peg`), the target peg (`to_peg`), and the auxiliary peg (`aux_peg`).\n2.  Implement the base case, where `n` equals 1. In this case, simply move the disk from the `from_peg` to the `to_peg`.\n3.  For `n` greater than 1, recursively move `n-1` disks from the `from_peg` to the `aux_peg`, using the `to_peg` as a temporary storage.\n4.  Move the nth disk from the `from_peg` to the `to_peg`.\n5.  Recursively move the `n-1` disks from the `aux_peg` to the `to_peg`, using the `from_peg` as a temporary storage.\n6.  Define the `main` function, which sets up the puzzle with a specified number of disks and pegs, and then calls the `tower_of_hanoi` function to solve it.\n7.  Run the program using the `main` function to see the step-by-step solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n\nNote that the number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of disks. This program provides a clear and efficient solution to the puzzle using recursion.",
