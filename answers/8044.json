  "answer": "**Movie Rating Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines the movie rating based on the user's age and the movie's rating. It uses an if/else statement to check the user's age and the movie's rating, and then prints out a message indicating whether the user is allowed to watch the movie.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef determine_movie_rating(user_age, movie_rating):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the movie rating based on the user's age and the movie's rating.\n\n    Args:\n        user_age (int): The user's age.\n        movie_rating (str): The movie's rating (G, PG, PG-13, R).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating whether the user is allowed to watch the movie.\n    \"\"\"\n    if movie_rating == \"G\":\n        return \"You are allowed to watch this movie.\"\n    elif movie_rating == \"PG\":\n        if user_age >= 8:\n            return \"You are allowed to watch this movie with parental guidance.\"\n        else:\n            return \"You are not allowed to watch this movie.\"\n    elif movie_rating == \"PG-13\":\n        if user_age >= 13:\n            return \"You are allowed to watch this movie with parental guidance.\"\n        else:\n            return \"You are not allowed to watch this movie.\"\n    elif movie_rating == \"R\":\n        if user_age >= 17:\n            return \"You are allowed to watch this movie.\"\n        else:\n            return \"You are not allowed to watch this movie.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid movie rating.\"\n\ndef main():\n    user_age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    movie_rating = input(\"Enter the movie's rating (G, PG, PG-13, R): \")\n    print(determine_movie_rating(user_age, movie_rating))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user's age is 10 and the movie's rating is PG, the program will print \"You are allowed to watch this movie with parental guidance.\"\n* If the user's age is 15 and the movie's rating is R, the program will print \"You are not allowed to watch this movie.\"\n* If the user's age is 20 and the movie's rating is G, the program will print \"You are allowed to watch this movie.\"\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the user will enter a valid age and movie rating.\n* The program uses a simple if/else statement to determine the movie rating, and does not take into account other factors that may affect the user's ability to watch the movie.",
