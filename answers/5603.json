  "prompt": "Develop a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user, taking the user's choice as input and generating a random choice for the computer.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        elif user_choice.lower() not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice.lower(), computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`get_computer_choice` function**: This function generates a random choice for the computer from the list [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"].\n2. **`determine_winner` function**: This function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and returns the result of the game.\n3. **`main` function**: This function is the entry point of the program. It contains a loop that continues until the user chooses to quit.\n   * Inside the loop, it prompts the user for their choice and checks if the input is valid.\n   * If the input is valid, it generates the computer's choice and determines the winner.\n   * Finally, it prints the result of the game.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter \"rock\" when prompted for your choice. The program will generate a random choice for the computer and print the result of the game.\n* Enter \"q\" when prompted for your choice to quit the program.\n* Enter an invalid choice (e.g., \"abc\") to see an error message and be prompted again for your choice.",
