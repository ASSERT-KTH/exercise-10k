  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to print the Fizz Buzz sequence up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the Fizz Buzz sequence up to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number up to which the sequence should be printed.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz Buzz\")\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz\")\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Buzz\")\n        else:\n            print(i)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the number up to which the sequence should be printed\n    n = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Print the Fizz Buzz sequence\n    fizz_buzz(n)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. For each number `i`, the function checks the following conditions:\n   * If `i` is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints \"Fizz Buzz\".\n   * If `i` is a multiple of 3 but not 5, it prints \"Fizz\".\n   * If `i` is a multiple of 5 but not 3, it prints \"Buzz\".\n   * If `i` is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.\n4. The `main()` function asks the user for a number, calls the `fizz_buzz(n)` function with the user's input, and prints the Fizz Buzz sequence.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter a number when prompted. For example, if you enter `20`, the program will print the Fizz Buzz sequence up to 20. The output will look like this:\n\n```\n1\n2\nFizz\n4\nBuzz\nFizz\n7\n8\nFizz\nBuzz\n11\nFizz\n13\n14\nFizz Buzz\n16\n17\nFizz\n19\nBuzz\n```",
