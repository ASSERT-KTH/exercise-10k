  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations on Float Variables\n#### Overview\n\nThis example demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two float variables in Python.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Create two float variables\n    num1 = 10.5\n    num2 = 2.5\n\n    # Perform basic arithmetic operations\n    addition = num1 + num2\n    subtraction = num1 - num2\n    multiplication = num1 * num2\n    division = num1 / num2\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Results of Arithmetic Operations:\")\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Example Output\n\n```\nResults of Arithmetic Operations:\nAddition: 10.5 + 2.5 = 13.0\nSubtraction: 10.5 - 2.5 = 8.0\nMultiplication: 10.5 * 2.5 = 26.25\nDivision: 10.5 / 2.5 = 4.2\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We define two float variables `num1` and `num2` with values `10.5` and `2.5`, respectively.\n2. We perform basic arithmetic operations on these variables using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, storing the results in separate variables.\n3. Finally, we print the results of each operation using f-strings for formatted output.",
