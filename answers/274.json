  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Cities**\n=============================================\n\nThis program uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two cities given their latitude and longitude.\n\n### Haversine Formula\n\nThe Haversine formula is a formula used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth) given their longitudes and latitudes. The formula is as follows:\n\n`d = 2 * arcsin(sqrt(haversin(\u0394lat) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * haversin(\u0394long)))`\n\nwhere:\n- `d` is the distance between the two points\n- `\u0394lat` is the difference in latitude between the two points\n- `\u0394long` is the difference in longitude between the two points\n- `lat1` and `lat2` are the latitudes of the two points\n- `haversin(x) = sin^2(x/2)`\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the Haversine formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two cities given their latitude and longitude.\n\n    Args:\n        lat1 (float): Latitude of the first city\n        lon1 (float): Longitude of the first city\n        lat2 (float): Latitude of the second city\n        lon2 (float): Longitude of the second city\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two cities in kilometers\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert latitudes and longitudes to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Calculate differences in latitude and longitude\n    delta_lat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    delta_lon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n\n    # Apply Haversine formula\n    a = math.sin(delta_lat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(delta_lon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n\n    # Radius of the Earth in kilometers\n    R = 6371\n\n    # Calculate distance\n    distance = R * c\n\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    lat1 = 40.7128  # New York City\n    lon1 = -74.0060\n    lat2 = 34.0522  # Los Angeles\n    lon2 = -118.2437\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)\n    print(f\"The distance between New York City and Los Angeles is {distance:.2f} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes in the latitudes and longitudes of two cities as input.\n2. It converts these values to radians using the `math.radians` function.\n3. It calculates the differences in latitude and longitude between the two cities.\n4. It applies the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the two cities.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example cities.\n6. The program prints out the calculated distance between the two cities.",
