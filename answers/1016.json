  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and an integer as input, and returns the justified version of the string, where the words are spaced evenly to fill the given width.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def fullJustify(self, words, maxWidth):\n        result, current_line, current_width = [], [], 0\n        for word in words:\n            if current_width + len(word) + len(current_line) > maxWidth:\n                for i in range(len(current_line) - 1, 0, -1):\n                    current_line[i] += ' '\n                if len(current_line) == 1:\n                    current_line[0] += ' ' * (maxWidth - len(current_line[0]))\n                result.append(''.join(current_line))\n                current_line, current_width = [], 0\n            current_line.append(word)\n            current_width += len(word)\n        last_line = ' '.join(current_line)\n        last_line += ' ' * (maxWidth - len(last_line))\n        result.append(last_line)\n        return result\n```\nI hope this meets the requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code.",
