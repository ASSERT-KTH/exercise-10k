  "answer": "**Strong Password Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python function that checks if a given string is a strong password. A strong password is defined as one that:\n\n* Is at least 8 characters long\n* Contains at least one uppercase letter\n* Contains at least one lowercase letter\n* Contains at least one digit\n* Contains at least one special character\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_strong_password(password: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a strong password.\n\n    A strong password is defined as one that:\n    - Is at least 8 characters long\n    - Contains at least one uppercase letter\n    - Contains at least one lowercase letter\n    - Contains at least one digit\n    - Contains at least one special character\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # If all checks pass, password is strong\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    passwords = [\n        \"weak\",\n        \"Strong1\",\n        \"Strong1!\",\n        \"Short1!\"\n    ]\n\n    for password in passwords:\n        print(f\"Is '{password}' a strong password? {is_strong_password(password)}\")\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. If the password meets all the requirements, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a list of passwords.",
