  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a bank account using a while loop:\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.balance = 0.0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `BankAccount` class has methods for depositing, withdrawing, and getting the current balance.\n2. The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` object and enters a while loop.\n3. Inside the loop, the program prints a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or quit.\n4. The user is prompted to enter their choice.\n5. Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding action:\n\t* Deposit: prompts the user for an amount and calls the `deposit` method.\n\t* Withdraw: prompts the user for an amount and calls the `withdraw` method.\n\t* Check balance: calls the `get_balance` method and prints the result.\n\t* Quit: breaks out of the loop and ends the program.\n6. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n\nExample use case:\n\n```\nBank Account Menu:\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Check balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 1\nEnter amount to deposit: $100\nDeposited $100.00. New balance: $100.00\n\nBank Account Menu:\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Check balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 2\nEnter amount to withdraw: $50\nWithdrew $50.00. New balance: $50.00\n\nBank Account Menu:\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Check balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 3\nCurrent balance: $50.00\n\nBank Account Menu:\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Check balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 4\nGoodbye!\n```",
