  "answer": "**Insertion Sort Algorithm Implementation**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nInsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. Each subsequent element from the unsorted region is inserted into the sorted region in its correct position.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `insertion_sort` function takes an array as input and iterates over it starting from the second element (index 1).\n2.  For each element, it stores the current element as the `key` and initializes a pointer `j` to the previous element.\n3.  The algorithm then enters a while loop, which continues as long as `j` is non-negative and the element at index `j` is greater than the `key`.\n4.  Inside the loop, the element at index `j` is shifted one position to the right by assigning the value of `arr[j]` to `arr[j + 1]`.\n5.  The pointer `j` is then decremented by 1.\n6.  Once the while loop exits, the `key` is inserted at the correct position by assigning it to `arr[j + 1]`.\n7.  This process is repeated for each element in the array, resulting in a sorted array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case: O(n) when the input array is already sorted.\n*   Average-case: O(n^2) for random input arrays.\n*   Worst-case: O(n^2) when the input array is reverse sorted.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   O(1) since the algorithm only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `key` and `j` variables.",
