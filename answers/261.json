  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1.

The program will guide you through the process of selecting an operation and entering two numbers.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Functions:** The program defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of the corresponding operation.\n2.  **Main Function:** The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu for selecting an arithmetic operation, prompts the user to enter two numbers, and then performs the chosen operation.\n3.  **Error Handling:** The `divide` function checks if the second number is zero to avoid a division by zero error. If the user attempts to divide by zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError` with a descriptive message.\n4.  **User Input:** The program uses `input` to get user input for the operation choice and the two numbers. It converts the input to integers or floats as needed.\n5.  **Example Usage:** Run the program, select an operation, enter two numbers, and it will display the result of the chosen operation. For example, if you choose addition, enter `5` and `3`, the program will output `5 + 3 = 8.0`.",
