  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer grade as input and prints out whether the grade is passing (60 or above) or failing (below 60) using conditional statements (if/else).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int grade;\n    std::cout << \"Enter your grade: \";\n    std::cin >> grade;\n\n    if (grade >= 60) {\n        std::cout << \"Passing\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Failing\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header file, defines the `main` function, declares an integer variable `grade`, prompts the user to enter their grade, reads the input into the `grade` variable, checks the grade using an `if` statement, and prints out a message indicating whether the grade is passing or failing. The `return 0` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.",
