  "answer": "**Generating Perfect Squares with a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example of how to generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit using Python:\n\n```python\ndef generate_perfect_squares(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit.\n\n    Args:\n    limit (int): The upper limit for the perfect squares.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of perfect squares up to the given limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    perfect_squares = []\n    i = 1\n    while True:\n        square = i ** 2\n        if square > limit:\n            break\n        perfect_squares.append(square)\n        i += 1\n    return perfect_squares\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 100\nresult = generate_perfect_squares(limit)\nprint(f\"Perfect squares up to {limit}: {result}\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a for loop with the `math.sqrt` function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_perfect_squares(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a list of perfect squares up to a given limit.\n\n    Args:\n    limit (int): The upper limit for the perfect squares.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of perfect squares up to the given limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    perfect_squares = []\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(limit)) + 1):\n        perfect_squares.append(i ** 2)\n    return perfect_squares\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 100\nresult = generate_perfect_squares(limit)\nprint(f\"Perfect squares up to {limit}: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn both examples, we define a function `generate_perfect_squares` that takes an integer `limit` as input and returns a list of perfect squares up to that limit. The function uses a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to the square root of the limit, calculates the square of each number, and adds it to the list if it's less than or equal to the limit. Finally, the function returns the list of perfect squares.\n\n**Output:**\n\nFor a limit of 100, the output will be:\n```\nPerfect squares up to 100: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```",
