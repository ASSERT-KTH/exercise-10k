  "prompt": "Given an array of integers, write a program to sort the elements in ascending order.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the elements in ascending order:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the elements of an array in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(arr)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sort_array(arr))\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sort_array()` that takes an array of integers as input, sorts it using the `sorted()` function, and returns the sorted array. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.\n\nIf you want to implement a sorting algorithm from scratch, you can use a simple algorithm like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort. Here is an example of Bubble Sort:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the elements of an array in ascending order using Bubble Sort.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `bubble_sort()` that takes an array of integers as input, sorts it using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and returns the sorted array. The Bubble Sort algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.\n\nNote: The Bubble Sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it less efficient for large datasets. The `sorted()` function in Python uses a more efficient sorting algorithm called Timsort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average.",
