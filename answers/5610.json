  "answer": "**Simple Chatbot Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a chatbot in Python. This program uses a dictionary to store pre-defined responses to certain keywords.\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with pre-defined responses\nresponses = {\n    'hello': ['Hi, how are you?', 'Hello! What can I help you with?', 'Hey, what\\'s up?'],\n    'how are you': ['I\\'m doing great, thanks for asking!', 'I\\'m just a chatbot, I don\\'t have feelings.', 'I\\'m good, thanks!'],\n    'what is your purpose': ['My purpose is to assist and provide information.', 'I\\'m here to help answer your questions.', 'My purpose is to chat with you and provide helpful responses.'],\n    'default': ['I didn\\'t understand that. Can you please rephrase?', 'I\\'m not sure I understand. Can you explain?', 'I didn\\'t catch that. Can you try again?']\n}\n\ndef get_response(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a message and returns a pre-defined response.\n    \n    Args:\n        message (str): The user's input message.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: A pre-defined response to the user's message.\n    \"\"\"\n    message = message.lower()\n    \n    # Check if the message contains any of the pre-defined keywords\n    for keyword in responses:\n        if keyword in message:\n            # Return a random response from the list of pre-defined responses\n            return random.choice(responses[keyword])\n    \n    # If the message doesn't contain any of the pre-defined keywords, return a default response\n    return random.choice(responses['default'])\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Get the user's input message\n        message = input(\"You: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if message.lower() == 'quit':\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Get the chatbot's response\n        response = get_response(message)\n        \n        # Print the chatbot's response\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   The user types \"hello\" and the chatbot responds with a random greeting.\n*   The user types \"how are you\" and the chatbot responds with a random response about its state.\n*   The user types \"what is your purpose\" and the chatbot responds with a random response about its purpose.\n*   The user types something that doesn't contain any of the pre-defined keywords, and the chatbot responds with a default response.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\n1.  Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `chatbot.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program by typing `python chatbot.py` and pressing Enter.\n4.  Interact with the chatbot by typing messages and pressing Enter.\n5.  Type 'quit' to exit the program.",
