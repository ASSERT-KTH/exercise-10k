The `longest_palindromic_substring` function iterates over the input string and treats each character as the center of a potential palindrome.\n2. For each center, it checks for both odd and even length palindromes by calling the `expand_around_center` function.\n3. The `expand_around_center` function expands around the center of the palindrome as long as the characters on both sides match, effectively finding the longest palindromic substring centered at the given indices.\n4. The `longest_palindromic_substring` function keeps track of the longest palindromic substring found so far and returns it at the end.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* The time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, we potentially expand around the center up to the length of the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n* The space complexity of this program is O(1), excluding the space needed for the input and output strings. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the longest palindromic substring found so far.",
