The `calculate_text_statistics` function takes a text as input and calculates various statistics about it, such as the number of characters, words, sentences, average word length, and average sentence length.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for a text, calculates the text statistics using the `calculate_text_statistics` function, and prints the results.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nPlease enter a text: This is a sample text. It has multiple sentences.\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nText Statistics:\n-----------------\nNumber of characters: 46\nNumber of words: 11\nNumber of sentences: 2\nAverage word length: 4.55\nAverage sentence length: 5.50\n```",
