  "answer": "**Student Grade Analyzer Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program analyzes a dictionary of student grades, calculates the average grade for each student, and prints out the student's name, average grade, and a message indicating whether the student is passing or failing.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef analyze_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze a dictionary of student grades and print out the student's name, average grade, and pass/fail status.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): Dictionary with student names as keys and a list of grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Calculate the average grade for the student\n        average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n        # Determine whether the student is passing or failing\n        if average_grade >= 60:\n            status = \"Passing\"\n        else:\n            status = \"Failing\"\n\n        # Print out the student's name, average grade, and pass/fail status\n        print(f\"Student: {student}\")\n        print(f\"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Status: {status}\")\n        print()  # Empty line for readability\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    grades_dict = {\n        \"John Doe\": [80, 70, 90, 85],\n        \"Jane Smith\": [60, 65, 70, 75],\n        \"Bob Johnson\": [40, 50, 60, 55]\n    }\n\n    analyze_grades(grades_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `analyze_grades` function takes a dictionary `grades_dict` as input, where each key is a student's name and each value is a list of grades.\n2.  The function iterates over each student in the dictionary using a `for` loop.\n3.  For each student, it calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of grades.\n4.  It then determines whether the student is passing (average grade >= 60) or failing (average grade < 60) based on the average grade.\n5.  Finally, it prints out the student's name, average grade, and pass/fail status.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nStudent: John Doe\nAverage Grade: 81.25\nStatus: Passing\n\nStudent: Jane Smith\nAverage Grade: 67.50\nStatus: Passing\n\nStudent: Bob Johnson\nAverage Grade: 51.25\nStatus: Failing\n```",
