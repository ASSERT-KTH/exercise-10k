  "prompt": "Create a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules and output the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        user1 = input(\"Player 1, enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        user2 = input(\"Player 2, enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        while user1 not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user1 = input(\"Invalid input. Player 1, enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user2 not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user2 = input(\"Invalid input. Player 2, enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        print(f\"\\nPlayer 1 chose {user1}, Player 2 chose {user2}.\\n\")\n\n        if user1 == user2:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user1}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user1 == \"rock\":\n            if user2 == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! Player 1 wins!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! Player 2 wins.\")\n        elif user1 == \"paper\":\n            if user2 == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! Player 1 wins.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! Player 2 wins.\")\n        elif user1 == \"scissors\":\n            if user2 == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! Player 1 wins.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! Player 2 wins.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n### How to Run\n1. Save the code in a Python file, for example `rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n4. Run the game by typing `python rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n5. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n### How it Works\n1. The program enters an infinite loop where it continually asks two players for their choices.\n2. It checks if the inputs are valid (rock, paper, or scissors) and asks for input again if they are not.\n3. It then determines the winner based on the game's rules and prints the result.\n4. After each game, it asks if the players want to play again.\n5. If they choose not to play again, the loop breaks and the program ends.",
