It iterates over each student in the dictionary, calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades, and stores the result in a new dictionary `average_grades`. If a student has no grades, it stores a message indicating that there are no grades available. Finally, it returns the dictionary with the average grades for each student. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a sample dictionary of students and their grades.",
