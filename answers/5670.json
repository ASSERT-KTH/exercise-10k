  "answer": "**Rounding Program**\n======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a floating-point number as input and outputs its rounded value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef round_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Round the number\n    rounded_num = round_number(num)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Rounded number:\", rounded_num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a number when prompted (e.g., `3.7`).\n3. The program will output the rounded number (e.g., `4`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `round()` function in Python rounds a number to the nearest integer.\n* The `float()` function is used to convert the user's input to a floating-point number.\n* The `input()` function is used to get user input.\n* The `main()` function serves as the program's entry point.",
