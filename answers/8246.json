  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year using if/else statements.\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function with a year\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input.\n2. It checks if the `year` is divisible by 4. If it's not, the `year` is not a leap year.\n3. If the `year` is divisible by 4, it then checks if the `year` is a century year (i.e., divisible by 100). If it's not a century year, it's a leap year.\n4. If the `year` is a century year, it checks if the `year` is divisible by 400. If it is, the `year` is a leap year. Otherwise, it's not a leap year.\n5. The user is prompted to enter a year, and the `is_leap_year` function is called with this input.\n6. Based on the return value of the `is_leap_year` function, the program prints whether the input year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- Input: `2000` - Output: `2000 is a leap year.`\n- Input: `1900` - Output: `1900 is not a leap year.`\n- Input: `2020` - Output: `2020 is a leap year.`\n- Input: `2019` - Output: `2019 is not a leap year.`",
