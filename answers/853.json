  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that decorates another function, adding a new behavior to the original function without modifying it. This will help you understand how to implement a decorator in Python. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining our decorator function. This function will take another function as an argument.\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator function that adds a new behavior to the original function without modifying it.\n    \n    Args:\n        func (function): The original function to be decorated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A new function with the added behavior.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Inside our decorator function, we define a new function that will wrap the original function.\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # Before calling the original function, we can add some new behavior.\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        \n        # Now we call the original function with the given arguments and keyword arguments.\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # After calling the original function, we can add some more new behavior.\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n        \n        # Finally, we return the result of the original function.\n        return result\n    \n    # We return the wrapper function from our decorator function.\n    return wrapper\n\n# Now we can use our decorator to decorate another function.\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    A function that prints a hello message.\n    \n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to greet.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # This function simply prints a hello message.\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# We can call the decorated function like any other function.\nsay_hello(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `my_decorator` function is defined to take another function `func` as an argument. It returns a new function `wrapper` that wraps the original function, allowing for additional behavior to be added before and after the original function is called.\n*   Inside the `wrapper` function, the original function `func` is called with the provided arguments `*args` and keyword arguments `**kwargs`. This ensures that the original function's behavior is preserved while adding new behavior around it.\n*   The `@my_decorator` syntax is used to apply the `my_decorator` function to the `say_hello` function, effectively decorating it with the additional behavior defined in the `wrapper` function.\n*   When the decorated `say_hello` function is called, it exhibits the original behavior of printing a hello message, surrounded by the additional behavior added by the decorator.",
