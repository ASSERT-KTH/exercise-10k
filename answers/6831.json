  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates an employee's net salary based on their gross salary and tax bracket. The tax brackets are as follows: 10% for gross salaries up to $10,000, 20% for gross salaries between $10,001 and $20,000, and 30% for gross salaries above $20,000. Use conditional statements to determine the tax bracket and calculate the net salary.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the gross_salary variable\ngross_salary = 40000\n\n# Define the tax rates and brackets\ntax_rate = 0.10\nif gross_salary > 10000:\n    tax_rate = 0.20\nif gross_salary > 20000:\n    tax_rate = 0.30\n\n# Calculate the tax_amount\ntax_amount = gross_salary * tax_rate\n\n# Calculate the net_salary\nnet_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Gross Salary: \", gross_salary)\nprint(\"Tax Amount: \", tax_amount)\nprint(\"Net Salary: \", net_salary)\n```\nThis code initializes the `gross_salary` variable, determines the tax rate based on the gross salary, calculates the tax amount and net salary, and prints the results to the console.",
