  "answer": "Here is a Python program to perform basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) on two integers:\n\n```python\ndef bitwise_operations(num1, num2):\n    # Perform bitwise operations\n    and_result = num1 & num2\n    or_result = num1 | num2\n    xor_result = num1 ^ num2\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Bitwise AND of {num1} and {num2}: {and_result}\")\n    print(f\"Bitwise OR of {num1} and {num2}: {or_result}\")\n    print(f\"Bitwise XOR of {num1} and {num2}: {xor_result}\")\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 5   # Binary: 101\nnum2 = 3   # Binary: 011\nbitwise_operations(num1, num2)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `bitwise_operations` that takes two integers as input.\n2. Inside the function, it performs the bitwise operations using the corresponding operators:\n   - `&` for bitwise AND\n   - `|` for bitwise OR\n   - `^` for bitwise XOR\n3. The results are then printed to the console.\n4. The example usage demonstrates the function with two integers, `num1` and `num2`, and prints the results.\n\n**Explanation of bitwise operations:**\n\n*   **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0.\n*   **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0.\n*   **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nUsing the example integers `num1 = 5` (binary: 101) and `num2 = 3` (binary: 011):\n\n*   Bitwise AND (`&`): `101 & 011 = 001` (decimal: 1)\n*   Bitwise OR (`|`): `101 | 011 = 111` (decimal: 7)\n*   Bitwise XOR (`^`): `101 ^ 011 = 110` (decimal: 6)",
