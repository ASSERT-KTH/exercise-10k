  "answer": "**Maximum of Two Numbers Program**\n====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_max(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the maximum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num1 > num2:\n        return num1\n    else:\n        return num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 10\n    num2 = 20\n    max_num = find_max(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The maximum of {num1} and {num2} is {max_num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_max` function takes two numbers `num1` and `num2` as input.\n2. It uses an if/else statement to compare the two numbers.\n3. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, it returns `num1`.\n4. Otherwise, it returns `num2`.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `find_max` function with example numbers.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe maximum of 10 and 20 is 20\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program can be used as a building block for more complex programs that require finding the maximum of multiple numbers.\n* The if/else statement can be replaced with the built-in `max` function in Python, which is more concise and efficient. However, this program is intended to demonstrate the use of if/else statements.",
