  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers from both lists.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that combines two lists of integers into a new list:\n\n```python\ndef combine_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two lists of integers into a new list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of integers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all the integers from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Combine the two lists into a new list\n    combined_list = list1 + list2\n    \n    # Return the combined list\n    return combined_list\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\ncombined = combine_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function called `combine_lists` that takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as arguments.\n2.  Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to concatenate `list1` and `list2` into a new list called `combined_list`.\n3.  The function returns `combined_list`.\n4.  We provide example usage of the function by combining two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and printing the resulting combined list.\n\nThis solution is concise and easy to understand, making it a good fit for the problem.",
