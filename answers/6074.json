  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program should use a while loop to keep asking for input until the correct number is guessed, and provide hints to the user if their guess is too high or too low.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n<?php\n\nfunction guess_number() {\n  $number = rand(0, 100);\n  $tries = 0;\n\n  while (true) {\n    $guess = readline(\"Guess a number between 0 and 100: \");\n    $guess = (int)$guess;\n\n    $tries++;\n\n    if ($guess > $number) {\n      echo \"Too high!\" . \"\\n\";\n    } elseif ($guess < $number) {\n      echo \"Too low!\" . \"\\n\";\n    } else {\n      echo \"Congratulations! You guessed the number in $tries tries.\" . \"\\n\";\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nguess_number();\n\n?>\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined in the breakdown. It defines a `guess_number` function that generates a random number, initializes a `$tries` variable, and enters a `while` loop that continues indefinitely until the correct number is guessed. Inside the loop, it prompts the user for input, increments the `$tries` variable, and provides hints to the user based on their guess. When the correct number is guessed, it outputs a success message and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement. Finally, it calls the `guess_number` function to start the game.",
