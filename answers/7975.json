  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number for which to calculate the factorial.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n\n    return math.factorial(n)\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    try:\n        factorial = calculate_factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `calculate_factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial using the `math.factorial` function.\n2. It checks if the input number is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, attempts to calculate its factorial using the `calculate_factorial` function, and prints the result.\n4. If the input number is negative, it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.\n\n### Example usage\n\n* Run the program and enter a positive integer (e.g., `5`) to see its factorial (e.g., `120`).\n* Run the program and enter a negative integer (e.g., `-5`) to see an error message indicating that the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.",
