  "answer": "**Word Counter Program**\n========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a string and counts the number of words in it.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of words in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count words from.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = input_string.split()\n    return len(words)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for a string\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Count the number of words in the string\n    word_count = count_words(user_string)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The string contains {word_count} words.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a string when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is a test\").\n3. The program will print the number of words in the string (e.g., \"The string contains 6 words.\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program considers punctuation as part of a word. If you want to handle punctuation differently, you may need to use a more advanced method, such as using regular expressions to split the string.\n* This program assumes that words are separated by spaces. If you need to handle other types of word separators (e.g., tabs, newlines), you may need to modify the `split()` method accordingly.",
