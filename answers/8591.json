  "prompt": "Write a function to find the intersection of two dictionaries",
  "answer": "**Dictionary Intersection Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following function finds the intersection of two dictionaries based on their keys. It returns a new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are common to both input dictionaries.\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two dictionaries based on their keys.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are common to both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key in dict2 and dict1[key] == dict2[key]}\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nintersection = dict_intersection(dict1, dict2)\nprint(intersection)  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n**Alternative Solution Using Dictionary Comprehension with Set Intersection**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can also use set intersection to find the common keys between the two dictionaries and then use dictionary comprehension to create the resulting dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two dictionaries based on their keys.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are common to both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    common_keys = set(dict1.keys()) & set(dict2.keys())\n    return {key: dict1[key] for key in common_keys if dict1[key] == dict2[key]}\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nintersection = dict_intersection(dict1, dict2)\nprint(intersection)  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\nBoth functions will produce the same result, but the second solution may be more efficient for large dictionaries since it uses set intersection to find the common keys, which has an average time complexity of O(min(len(dict1), len(dict2))).",
