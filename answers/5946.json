The program will prompt the user for input and then print out the completed story.\n\n```\nPlease provide the following words:\nNoun: cat\nVerb (e.g., run, jump, read): purr\nAdjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): fluffy\nAdverb (e.g., quickly, loudly, wisely): quickly\n\nHere is your Mad Libs story:\nOne day, a very fluffy cat was walking down the street. Suddenly, it started to purr quickly and purr some more. The cat was so fluffy that it purr all the way home.\n```\n\n### Advice\nTo make the program more interesting, you can add more story templates and randomly select one each time the program is run. You can also add more word types (e.g., plural noun, verb ending in -ing) to increase the variety of the generated stories.",
