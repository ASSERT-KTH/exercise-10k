  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user, performs integer division, and prints the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications you provided:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b;\n\n    printf(\"Enter two integers: \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    if (b == 0) {\n        printf(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        int result = a / b;\n        printf(\"%d divided by %d is %d\\n\", a, b, result);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `stdio.h` library, declares an `int` variable `a` and `b`, reads two integer inputs from the user using `scanf`, checks if the second integer is zero, and performs integer division using the `/` operator. The result is printed to the console using `printf`. If the second integer is zero, an error message is printed instead.",
