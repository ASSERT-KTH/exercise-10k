  "answer": "### Composing Two Functions\n#### Function Composition\n\nFunction composition is a process where two or more functions are combined to create a new function. Here's a Python function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two input functions.\n\n```python\ndef compose(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compose two functions together.\n\n    Args:\n        f (function): The outer function.\n        g (function): The inner function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n    def h(x):\n        return f(g(x))\n    return h\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions\ndouble_then_add_one = compose(add_one, double)\n\n# Test the composed function\nprint(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\nIn this example, `double_then_add_one` is a new function that first doubles its input and then adds one to the result. The `compose` function takes two functions `f` and `g` and returns a new function `h` that applies `g` to its input and then applies `f` to the result.\n\n#### Using a Higher-Order Function\n\nAlternatively, you can use a higher-order function to compose functions. Here's an example using a lambda function:\n\n```python\ndef compose(f, g):\n    return lambda x: f(g(x))\n\n# Example usage:\ndouble = lambda x: 2 * x\nadd_one = lambda x: x + 1\n\ndouble_then_add_one = compose(add_one, double)\nprint(double_then_add_one(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\nIn this example, the `compose` function uses a lambda function to create a new function that applies `g` to its input and then applies `f` to the result.\n\n#### Generalizing to Multiple Functions\n\nIf you want to compose multiple functions together, you can use a recursive approach:\n\n```python\ndef compose(*functions):\n    def h(x):\n        result = x\n        for f in reversed(functions):\n            result = f(result)\n        return result\n    return h\n\n# Example usage:\ndouble = lambda x: 2 * x\nadd_one = lambda x: x + 1\nsquare = lambda x: x ** 2\n\ndouble_then_add_one_then_square = compose(square, add_one, double)\nprint(double_then_add_one_then_square(5))  # Output: 121\n```\n\nIn this example, the `compose` function takes a variable number of functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies each function in reverse order.",
