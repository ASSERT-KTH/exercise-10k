  "answer": "**Inheritance and Polymorphism Demo in Python**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that demonstrates the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism using an example of a university with different types of employees.\n\n```python\n# Define a base class for Employee\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.salary = salary\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n        print(f\"Age: {self.age}\")\n        print(f\"Salary: {self.salary}\")\n\n# Define a subclass for Professor that inherits from Employee\nclass Professor(Employee):\n    def __init__(self, name, age, salary, department):\n        super().__init__(name, age, salary)\n        self.department = department\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        super().display_info()\n        print(f\"Department: {self.department}\")\n\n# Define a subclass for Lecturer that inherits from Employee\nclass Lecturer(Employee):\n    def __init__(self, name, age, salary, course):\n        super().__init__(name, age, salary)\n        self.course = course\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        super().display_info()\n        print(f\"Course: {self.course}\")\n\n# Define a function to demonstrate polymorphism\ndef display_employee_info(employee):\n    employee.display_info()\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    professor = Professor(\"John Doe\", 40, 50000, \"Computer Science\")\n    lecturer = Lecturer(\"Jane Smith\", 30, 40000, \"Mathematics\")\n\n    print(\"Professor's Information:\")\n    display_employee_info(professor)\n    print()\n\n    print(\"Lecturer's Information:\")\n    display_employee_info(lecturer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We define a base class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `salary`, and a method `display_info` to display these attributes.\n2.  We then define two subclasses, `Professor` and `Lecturer`, which inherit from the `Employee` class using inheritance.\n3.  Both `Professor` and `Lecturer` classes have their own specific attributes (`department` and `course`, respectively) and override the `display_info` method to include these attributes.\n4.  The `display_employee_info` function demonstrates polymorphism by taking an `employee` object as an argument and calling the `display_info` method on it. This method can be called on objects of any class that inherits from `Employee`.\n5.  In the `main` function, we create instances of `Professor` and `Lecturer` and pass them to the `display_employee_info` function to display their information.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nProfessor's Information:\nName: John Doe\nAge: 40\nSalary: 50000\nDepartment: Computer Science\n\nLecturer's Information:\nName: Jane Smith\nAge: 30\nSalary: 40000\nCourse: Mathematics\n```\n\nThis program showcases the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. The `Professor` and `Lecturer` classes inherit common attributes from the `Employee` class and add their specific attributes. The `display_employee_info` function demonstrates polymorphism by working with objects of different classes that share a common base class.",
