  "answer": "**GPA Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the GPA of a student based on their grades. It takes into account the grade points for each subject and the total number of credits.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades, credits):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the GPA of a student based on their grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grade points for each subject.\n        credits (list): A list of credits for each subject.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated GPA.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_points = sum([grade * credit for grade, credit in zip(grades, credits)])\n    total_credits = sum(credits)\n    return total_points / total_credits\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    subjects = [\"Math\", \"Science\", \"English\", \"History\"]\n    grades = [4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0]  # Grade points for each subject\n    credits = [3, 4, 3, 4]  # Credits for each subject\n\n    print(\"GPA Calculator\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    for subject, grade, credit in zip(subjects, grades, credits):\n        print(f\"{subject}: Grade = {grade}, Credits = {credit}\")\n\n    gpa = calculate_gpa(grades, credits)\n    print(f\"\\nGPA: {gpa:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gpa` function takes two lists as input: `grades` and `credits`. It calculates the total grade points by multiplying each grade by its corresponding credit and summing them up.\n2. The function then calculates the total credits by summing up all the credits.\n3. The GPA is calculated by dividing the total grade points by the total credits.\n4. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the program. We define the subjects, grades, and credits for each subject.\n5. We print out the GPA calculation for each subject and finally print out the calculated GPA.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nGPA Calculator\n----------------\nMath: Grade = 4.0, Credits = 3\nScience: Grade = 3.5, Credits = 4\nEnglish: Grade = 4.5, Credits = 3\nHistory: Grade = 3.0, Credits = 4\n\nGPA: 3.75\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes a 4.0 grade point scale, where A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0. You can modify the grade points to match your institution's grading scale.",
