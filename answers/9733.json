  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in %).\n        time (float): The time period (in years).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (%): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted.\n3. The program will display the calculated simple interest.\n\n**Example Input/Output:**\n\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the interest rate (%): 5\nEnter the time period (years): 2\nThe simple interest is: 100.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The interest rate is assumed to be in percentage.\n* The time period is assumed to be in years.\n* The program uses the formula for simple interest: `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`, where `SI` is the simple interest, `P` is the principal amount, `R` is the interest rate, and `T` is the time period.",
