  "answer": "### Creating a Dictionary and Retrieving a Value\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary with 3 key-value pairs\nmy_dict = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n}\n\n# Get a value by its key\ndef get_value_by_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve a value from a dictionary by its key.\"\"\"\n    return dictionary.get(key)\n\n# Example usage:\nkey_to_find = \"age\"\nvalue = get_value_by_key(my_dict, key_to_find)\n\nprint(f\"The value for key '{key_to_find}' is: {value}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\nThe value for key 'age' is: 30\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We create a dictionary called `my_dict` with three key-value pairs.\n*   We define a function `get_value_by_key` that takes a dictionary and a key as arguments.\n*   Inside the function, we use the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the value associated with the given key.\n*   If the key is not found in the dictionary, the `get` method will return `None` by default. You can also specify a custom default value as a second argument to `get`.\n*   We demonstrate how to use this function by finding the value for the key `\"age\"` in `my_dict`.",
