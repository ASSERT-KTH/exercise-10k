  "answer": "Here is a Python solution to check if a given number is an ugly number:\n\n```python\ndef is_ugly(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is an ugly number.\n    \n    An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is ugly, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Divide the number by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it's divisible\n    for divisor in [2, 3, 5]:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            n = n // divisor\n    \n    # If the number is reduced to 1, it's an ugly number\n    return n == 1\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_ugly(6))  # True\nprint(is_ugly(8))  # True\nprint(is_ugly(14))  # False\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `is_ugly` that takes an integer `n` as input. We first check if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case we return `False` because ugly numbers are defined as positive integers.\n\nThen, we divide `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it's divisible. This is done using a `for` loop and a `while` loop. If `n` is divisible by a divisor, we divide it and continue the loop. If `n` is no longer divisible by a divisor, we move on to the next divisor.\n\nFinally, we check if `n` has been reduced to 1. If it has, that means all its prime factors were 2, 3, or 5, so it's an ugly number and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nYou can use this function to check if any given number is an ugly number, as shown in the example usage at the end of the code.",
