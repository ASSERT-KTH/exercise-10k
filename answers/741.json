  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\n# Get the user's name\nuser_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Print out a greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome!\")\n```\n\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get the user's name. The string inside the parentheses is the prompt that will be displayed to the user.\n2. The user's input is stored in the `user_name` variable.\n3. The `print()` function is used to print out a greeting message. The `f-string` syntax (`f\"...\"`) is used to insert the `user_name` variable into the string.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g. `greeting.py`) and run it from the command line using `python greeting.py`. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name, and then it will print out a greeting message with your name.\n\nExample output:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John! Welcome!\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more robust program that handles invalid input, such as:\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    while True:\n        user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n        if user_name.strip():  # check if the input is not empty\n            return user_name\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please try again.\")\n\ndef main():\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print(f\"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis program uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for their name until they enter a non-empty string. The `strip()` method is used to remove any whitespace from the input. The `main()` function is used to call the `get_user_name()` function and print out the greeting message. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (i.e. not when it is imported as a module by another script).",
