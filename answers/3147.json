  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in an Array of Integers**\n\n### Problem Description\nGiven an array of integers, find the first duplicate in the array. A duplicate is an element that appears more than once in the array.\n\n### Solution\nWe will use a Python solution to solve this problem. The idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we encounter an element that we have seen before, we return that element as the first duplicate.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate in the array. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have seen so far.\n2. We iterate through the array `arr` using a for loop.\n3. For each element `num` in the array, we check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n4. If `num` is in the `seen` set, it means we have seen this element before, so we return it as the first duplicate.\n5. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue to the next element.\n6. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are doing a constant amount of work for each element in the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
