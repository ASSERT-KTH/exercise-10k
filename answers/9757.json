  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle based on the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.\n        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed in gallons.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumed == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return distance / fuel_consumed\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Fuel Efficiency Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed in gallons: \"))\n\n    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)\n\n    print(f\"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon (mpg)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Calculating fuel efficiency**:\n\t* Enter the distance traveled: 250 miles\n\t* Enter the amount of fuel consumed: 10 gallons\n\t* Output: Fuel efficiency: 25.00 miles per gallon (mpg)\n2. **Handling zero fuel consumption**:\n\t* Enter the distance traveled: 100 miles\n\t* Enter the amount of fuel consumed: 0 gallons\n\t* Output: Fuel efficiency: 0.00 miles per gallon (mpg)\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `fuel_consumed`.\n2. It checks if `fuel_consumed` is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. If `fuel_consumed` is not zero, it calculates the fuel efficiency by dividing `distance` by `fuel_consumed`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n5. It calls the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function with the user-input values and prints the result.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Make sure to enter the correct units for distance and fuel consumption (miles and gallons, respectively).\n* If you enter zero for fuel consumption, the program will output a fuel efficiency of zero.",
