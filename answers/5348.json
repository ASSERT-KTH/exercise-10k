  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a key function as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the values returned by the key function, and the values are lists of elements that have the corresponding key.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that groups a list of elements based on a key function and returns a dictionary with the corresponding keys and values. This function will allow you to categorize elements in a list based on certain criteria defined by the key function. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef group_by_key(lst, key_func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function groups a list of elements based on a key function.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of elements to be grouped.\n        key_func (function): A function that takes an element and returns its key.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the values returned by the key function, \n              and the values are lists of elements that have the corresponding key.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped elements\n    result = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Calculate the key for the current element using the key function\n        key = key_func(element)\n        \n        # If the key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value\n        if key not in result:\n            # This is done to avoid KeyError when trying to append to a non-existent key\n            result[key] = []\n        \n        # Append the current element to the list of its corresponding key\n        result[key].append(element)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with the grouped elements\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `group_by_key` initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the grouped elements. It then iterates over each element in the input list `lst`.\n* For each element, it calculates the key using the provided `key_func` and checks if the key already exists in the `result` dictionary. If not, it adds the key with an empty list as its value.\n* The function then appends the current element to the list of its corresponding key in the `result` dictionary.\n* Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary, which contains the grouped elements based on the keys returned by the `key_func`.",
