  "answer": "Here is a Python program that converts a string to its UTF-8 encoded representation:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_utf8(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function converts a string to its UTF-8 encoded representation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to be converted.\n\n    Returns:\n        bytes: The UTF-8 encoded representation of the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the encode() method to convert the string to UTF-8\n    utf8_bytes = input_string.encode('utf-8')\n\n    return utf8_bytes\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    utf8_bytes = string_to_utf8(input_string)\n\n    print(f\"Input String: {input_string}\")\n    print(f\"UTF-8 Encoded Representation: {utf8_bytes}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `string_to_utf8` function takes an input string and uses the `encode()` method to convert it to its UTF-8 encoded representation.\n2. The `encode()` method returns a `bytes` object, which represents the UTF-8 encoded string.\n3. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `string_to_utf8` function by passing an example string and printing the UTF-8 encoded representation.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nInput String: Hello, World!\nUTF-8 Encoded Representation: b'Hello, World!'\n```\n\nNote that the UTF-8 encoded representation is returned as a `bytes` object, which is prefixed with `b` in the output.",
