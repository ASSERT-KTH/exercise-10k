  "answer": "**Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Two Numbers**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nRead two positive integers from the user and calculate their least common multiple.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method to calculate the LCM. The formula for LCM is:\n\nLCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)\n\nWe will use the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula\n    lcm = (num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Read two positive integers from the user\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first positive integer: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second positive integer: \"))\n    \n    # Check if the input numbers are positive\n    if num1 <= 0 or num2 <= 0:\n        print(\"Both numbers must be positive.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate the LCM\n        lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n        \n        # Print the result\n        print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the first positive integer: 12\nEnter the second positive integer: 15\nThe least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and returns their LCM.\n2. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the GCD of the two numbers.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).\n4. In the `main` function, two positive integers are read from the user.\n5. The `calculate_lcm` function is called with the user input, and the result is printed.",
