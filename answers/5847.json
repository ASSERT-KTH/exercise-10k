Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (e.g. 15 for 15%): \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n\n    # Calculate the total cost (including tip)\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"\\nMeal Cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip ({tip_percentage}%): ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_total_cost()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of your meal when prompted (e.g. `25.99`).\n3. Enter the tip percentage when prompted (e.g. `15`).\n4.
