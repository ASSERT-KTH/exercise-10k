  "answer": "**Last Non-Repeated Character Function**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function finds the last non-repeated character in a given string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef last_non_repeated_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the last non-repeated character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The last non-repeated character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store character frequencies\n    char_freq = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n    \n    # Find the last non-repeated character\n    for char in reversed(s):\n        if char_freq[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    # Return None if no non-repeated character exists\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(last_non_repeated_char(\"hello\"))  # Output: 'o'\n    print(last_non_repeated_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n    print(last_non_repeated_char(\"abcde\"))  # Output: 'e'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Create a dictionary `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  Iterate through the string to count the frequency of each character and store it in `char_freq`.\n3.  Iterate through the string in reverse order to find the last non-repeated character.\n4.  Return the last non-repeated character, or `None` if no such character exists.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we make two passes through the string: one to count character frequencies and another to find the last non-repeated character.",
