  "answer": "**Even Number Filter Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function filters a list of numbers to include only the even numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of numbers to include only the even numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of even integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list of numbers.\n*   For each number, it checks if the remainder of the division by 2 is 0 using the modulus operator (`%`).\n*   If the remainder is 0, the number is even and is included in the output list.\n*   The function returns the list of even numbers.\n\n### Alternative Solution Using Filter Function\n\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of numbers to include only the even numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of even integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis alternative solution uses the built-in `filter` function with a lambda function to achieve the same result.",
