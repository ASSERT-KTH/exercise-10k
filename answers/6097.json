  "answer": "Here's an implementation of the quick sort algorithm using recursive function calls and a for loop in Python:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list using the quick sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: If the list is empty or contains one element, it's already sorted.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Select the pivot element (in this case, the middle element).\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n\n    # Initialize lists to store elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot.\n    left = []\n    middle = []\n    right = []\n\n    # Iterate over the list and distribute elements into the left, middle, and right lists.\n    for x in arr:\n        if x < pivot:\n            left.append(x)\n        elif x == pivot:\n            middle.append(x)\n        else:\n            right.append(x)\n\n    # Recursively sort the left and right lists, and combine the results with the middle list.\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]\nprint(\"Original list:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", quick_sort(arr))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `quick_sort` function takes a list `arr` as input and returns the sorted list.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when the list contains one or zero elements, in which case it's already sorted.\n*   The function selects a pivot element from the list (in this case, the middle element) and partitions the other elements into three lists: `left`, `middle`, and `right`.\n*   The `left` list contains elements less than the pivot, the `middle` list contains elements equal to the pivot, and the `right` list contains elements greater than the pivot.\n*   The function then recursively sorts the `left` and `right` lists and combines the results with the `middle` list to produce the final sorted list.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n*   The average-case time complexity of the quick sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n*   However, in the worst-case scenario (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element in the list), the time complexity can be O(n^2).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n*   The space complexity of the quick sort algorithm is O(log n) due to the recursive function calls, where n is the number of elements in the list.",
