Split the input text into words and initialize variables to keep track of the current line and its width.\n2.  Iterate through each word, checking if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width.\n3.  If it would exceed, justify the current line by adding spaces between words and append it to the list of justified lines.\n4.  If it wouldn't exceed, add the word to the current line and update the current width.\n5.  After processing all words, justify the last line by adding spaces between words and to the end.\n6.  Return the list of justified lines.\n\nThe `justify_line` function calculates the number of spaces needed to fill the line and distributes them evenly between words. If there are remaining spaces, it adds them to the gaps between words from left to right.\n\nThe `justify_last_line` function joins the words with a single space and adds the remaining spaces to the end of the line to fill it.\n\nIn the example usage, the input text is justified with a maximum line width of 16 characters, and the resulting justified lines are printed.",
