  "answer": "Here's a Python program that finds the maximum and minimum values in a list using if/else statements:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_min(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the maximum and minimum values in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the maximum and minimum values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lst:\n        return None, None  # Return None if the list is empty\n\n    max_val = min_val = lst[0]  # Initialize max_val and min_val with the first element\n\n    for num in lst[1:]:\n        if num > max_val:\n            max_val = num\n        elif num < min_val:\n            min_val = num\n\n    return max_val, min_val\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4]\nmax_value, min_value = find_max_min(numbers)\n\nif max_value is not None and min_value is not None:\n    print(f\"Maximum value: {max_value}\")\n    print(f\"Minimum value: {min_value}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The list is empty.\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `find_max_min` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns `None` for both the maximum and minimum values.\n3. It initializes the `max_val` and `min_val` variables with the first element of the list.\n4. The function then iterates through the rest of the list (from the second element to the end).\n5. Inside the loop, it checks each number to see if it's greater than the current `max_val`. If it is, the function updates `max_val` with the new number.\n6. The function also checks if the number is less than the current `min_val`. If it is, the function updates `min_val` with the new number.\n7. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values found in the list.\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it only needs to iterate through the list once to find the maximum and minimum values.",
