  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a 2D array as input and returns a new 2D array with the rows and columns transposed. This function will help you rearrange the elements in the 2D array. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transpose_2d_array(input_array):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a 2D array as input and returns a new 2D array containing the same elements, \n    but with the rows and columns transposed.\n\n    Args:\n        input_array (list): A 2D list of elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new 2D list with the rows and columns of the input array transposed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(input_array, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n\n    # Then, we check if all elements in the input list are also lists. If not, we raise a ValueError.\n    if not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_array):\n        raise ValueError(\"All elements in the input list must be lists.\")\n\n    # We use the built-in zip function in Python, which makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.\n    # The * operator is used to unpack the input_array into separate arguments for the zip function.\n    # This will give us an iterator of tuples where the first tuple contains the first element from each of the argument sequences or iterables,\n    # the second tuple contains the second element from each, and so on.\n    transposed_array = zip(*input_array)\n\n    # We convert each tuple in the transposed_array into a list and return the result.\n    # We use a list comprehension to create a new list with the converted tuples.\n    # The list function is used to convert each tuple into a list.\n    return [list(row) for row in transposed_array]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `transpose_2d_array` first checks if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are also lists. If not, it raises a `TypeError` or `ValueError` accordingly.\n* It uses the built-in `zip` function with the `*` operator to unpack the input array into separate arguments, effectively transposing the rows and columns.\n* The `zip` function returns an iterator of tuples, which is then converted into a list of lists using a list comprehension.\n* Finally, the function returns the transposed 2D array.",
