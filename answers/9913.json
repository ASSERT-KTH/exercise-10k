  "answer": "**Basic User Query Responder**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that responds to basic user queries.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass QueryResponder:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.responses = {\n            'hello': 'Hi, how can I assist you today?',\n            'hi': 'Hello! What can I help you with?',\n            'goodbye': 'Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.',\n            'bye': 'See you later!',\n            'thanks': 'You\\'re welcome!',\n            'thank you': 'You\\'re welcome!',\n        }\n\n    def respond(self, query):\n        \"\"\"Respond to a user query.\"\"\"\n        query = query.lower()\n        if query in self.responses:\n            return self.responses[query]\n        else:\n            return 'Sorry, I didn\\'t understand that.'\n\ndef main():\n    responder = QueryResponder()\n    print('Welcome to the query responder! Type \"quit\" to exit.')\n    while True:\n        query = input('You: ')\n        if query.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        print('Responder:', responder.respond(query))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a `QueryResponder` class that stores a dictionary of query-response pairs.\n2. The `respond` method takes a user query as input and returns a response based on the query.\n3. In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `QueryResponder` class and enter a loop where we continuously prompt the user for input.\n4. If the user types \"quit\", we exit the loop and end the program.\n5. Otherwise, we pass the user's query to the `respond` method and print the response.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nWelcome to the query responder! Type \"quit\" to exit.\nYou: hello\nResponder: Hi, how can I assist you today?\nYou: thanks\nResponder: You're welcome!\nYou: goodbye\nResponder: Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.\nYou: quit\n```\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store query-response pairs. For a more advanced application, you may want to consider using a natural language processing (NLP) library or a machine learning model to improve the accuracy and flexibility of the query responder.",
