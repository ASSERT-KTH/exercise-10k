  "prompt": "Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\n\ndef print_numbers():\n    # Loop through numbers from 1 to 10\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(i)\n\n# Call the function\nprint_numbers()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function `print_numbers()` that contains the loop.\n*   The `range(1, 11)` function generates numbers from 1 to 10.\n*   The `for` loop iterates over the numbers generated by `range()` and assigns each number to the variable `i`.\n*   Inside the loop, we print the current number `i` using `print(i)`.\n*   Finally, we call the `print_numbers()` function to execute the loop.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to see the output.",
