  "answer": "**List Intersection Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the intersection of two given lists, returning a new list containing only the elements that are common to both input lists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the intersection of two input lists.\n\n    :param list1: The first input list.\n    :param list2: The second input list.\n    :return: A new list containing the common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [value for value in list1 if value in list2]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n    print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", list_intersection(list1, list2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `list1` and checks if each element is also present in `list2`. If an element is found in both lists, it is included in the resulting intersection list.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nAlternatively, you can use the built-in `set` data structure to find the intersection of two lists, which is more efficient for large lists:\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n```\n\nNote that this alternative solution does not preserve the original order of elements and may not work correctly if the input lists contain duplicate elements or unhashable types (e.g., lists, dictionaries). The original list comprehension solution does not have these limitations.",
