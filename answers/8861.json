  "answer": "**Harshad Number Checker Function**\n\nA Harshad number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.\n\n### Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef is_harshad_number(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a Harshad number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is a Harshad number, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the sum of the digits of the number\n    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n    \n    # Check if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits\n    return n % digit_sum == 0\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers_to_check = [18, 19, 36]\n    for num in numbers_to_check:\n        print(f\"{num} is a Harshad number: {is_harshad_number(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_harshad_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a Harshad number.\n2. The sum of the digits of `n` is calculated using a generator expression that iterates over each digit in the string representation of `n`, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up.\n3. The function checks if `n` is divisible by the sum of its digits by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the number is a Harshad number.\n4. In the example usage, we define a list of numbers to check and iterate over them, printing whether each number is a Harshad number.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the example usage, it will output:\n```\n18 is a Harshad number: True\n19 is a Harshad number: False\n36 is a Harshad number: True\n```",
