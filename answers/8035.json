  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses an if/else statement to determine if a year is a leap year.\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes a year as input and checks if it meets the conditions for a leap year:\n\t* The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n\t* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.\n2. The `main` function gets the year from the user, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will output \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will output \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000): The program will output \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900): The program will output \"1900 is not a leap year.\"",
