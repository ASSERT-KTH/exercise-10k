  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input, reverses the order of its elements, and then prints the reversed array. The program should handle arrays of varying lengths and should not use any built-in reverse functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid swap(int* a, int* b) {\n    int temp = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = temp;\n}\n\nvoid reverseArray(int* a, int n) {\n    int* left = a;\n    int* right = a + n - 1;\n\n    while (left < right) {\n        swap(left, right);\n        left++;\n        right--;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid printArray(int* a, int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", a[i]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);\n\n    printf(\"Original array: \");\n    printArray(a, n);\n\n    reverseArray(a, n);\n\n    printf(\"Reversed array: \");\n    printArray(a, n);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined, including the swap, reverse, and print functions, as well as the main function. It correctly reverses the array and prints the original and reversed arrays.",
