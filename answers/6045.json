  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes an integer year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program uses the following rules to determine if a year is a leap year:\n\n* The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is evenly divisible by 100), it must also be evenly divisible by 400.\n\nThe `is_leap_year` function takes an integer year as input and returns `True` if the year is a leap year and `False` otherwise. The `main` function gets the year from the user, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `2020`\n  Output: `2020 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `2021`\n  Output: `2021 is not a leap year.`\n* Input: `2000`\n  Output: `2000 is a leap year.`\n* Input: `1900`\n  Output: `1900 is not a leap year.`",
