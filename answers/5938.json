  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters, regardless of order.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any white spaces and convert to lower case\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if sorted strings are equal\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # True\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # False\n```\n\nThis solution works by first removing any white spaces from the input strings and converting them to lower case. It then sorts the characters in each string and checks if the sorted strings are equal. If they are equal, the original strings are anagrams of each other.\n\nHowever, please note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a counter-based approach with a time complexity of O(n). \n\nHere's how you could implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any white spaces and convert to lower case\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if character counts are equal\n    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # True\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # False\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the input strings. It then checks if the character counts are equal. If they are equal, the original strings are anagrams of each other.",
