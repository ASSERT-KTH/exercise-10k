  "answer": "**Character Health Simulator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a character's health decreasing by 10 each round until they reach 0 health.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef simulate_health_decrease(initial_health, health_decrease):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate a character's health decreasing by a specified amount each round.\n\n    Args:\n        initial_health (int): The character's initial health.\n        health_decrease (int): The amount of health to decrease each round.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    current_health = initial_health\n    round_number = 1\n\n    while current_health > 0:\n        print(f\"Round {round_number}: Health = {current_health}\")\n        current_health -= health_decrease\n        round_number += 1\n\n    print(f\"Round {round_number}: Health = {current_health} (DEAD)\")\n\ndef main():\n    initial_health = 100\n    health_decrease = 10\n\n    simulate_health_decrease(initial_health, health_decrease)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `simulate_health_decrease` function takes two arguments: `initial_health` and `health_decrease`.\n2. The function uses a while loop to simulate the character's health decreasing by `health_decrease` each round.\n3. The current health is printed at the beginning of each round.\n4. The loop continues until the character's health reaches 0.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `simulate_health_decrease` function with an initial health of 100 and a health decrease of 10 each round.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nRound 1: Health = 100\nRound 2: Health = 90\nRound 3: Health = 80\nRound 4: Health = 70\nRound 5: Health = 60\nRound 6: Health = 50\nRound 7: Health = 40\nRound 8: Health = 30\nRound 9: Health = 20\nRound 10: Health = 10\nRound 11: Health = 0 (DEAD)\n```",
