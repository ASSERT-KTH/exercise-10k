  "answer": "**Union of Two Arrays Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the union of two input arrays. The union of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in either set.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef union(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two input arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The union of arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1 + arr2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Union:\", union(arr1, arr2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `union` function takes two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It combines the two arrays into a single list using the `+` operator.\n3. It converts the combined list into a set using the `set` function, which automatically removes duplicates.\n4. It converts the set back into a list using the `list` function.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `union` function with example arrays.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the union array may not be the same as the original arrays, as sets are unordered in Python. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to create a new list with unique elements.",
