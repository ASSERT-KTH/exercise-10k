  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the discount on a given price based on a simple discount system (e.g., 10% off for students, 5% off for seniors)",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that implements a simple discount system:\n\n```python\nclass DiscountCalculator:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Define the discount percentages\n        self.discounts = {\n            \"student\": 0.10,\n            \"senior\": 0.05,\n        }\n\n    def calculate_discount(self, price, discount_type):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the discount based on the given price and discount type.\n\n        Args:\n        - price (float): The original price.\n        - discount_type (str): The type of discount (e.g., \"student\", \"senior\").\n\n        Returns:\n        - discount (float): The calculated discount amount.\n        \"\"\"\n        if discount_type in self.discounts:\n            discount_percentage = self.discounts[discount_type]\n            discount = price * discount_percentage\n            return discount\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid discount type: {discount_type}\")\n\n    def calculate_price_after_discount(self, price, discount_type):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the price after applying the discount.\n\n        Args:\n        - price (float): The original price.\n        - discount_type (str): The type of discount (e.g., \"student\", \"senior\").\n\n        Returns:\n        - price_after_discount (float): The price after applying the discount.\n        \"\"\"\n        discount = self.calculate_discount(price, discount_type)\n        price_after_discount = price - discount\n        return price_after_discount\n\n\ndef main():\n    calculator = DiscountCalculator()\n\n    # Test with a student discount\n    price = 100.0\n    discount_type = \"student\"\n    discount = calculator.calculate_discount(price, discount_type)\n    price_after_discount = calculator.calculate_price_after_discount(price, discount_type)\n\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Type: {discount_type.capitalize()}\")\n    print(f\"Discount: ${discount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Price after Discount: ${price_after_discount:.2f}\")\n\n    # Test with a senior discount\n    price = 200.0\n    discount_type = \"senior\"\n    discount = calculator.calculate_discount(price, discount_type)\n    price_after_discount = calculator.calculate_price_after_discount(price, discount_type)\n\n    print(f\"\\nOriginal Price: ${price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Type: {discount_type.capitalize()}\")\n    print(f\"Discount: ${discount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Price after Discount: ${price_after_discount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis code defines a `DiscountCalculator` class that encapsulates the discount calculation logic. The class has two methods:\n\n*   `calculate_discount`: Calculates the discount amount based on the given price and discount type.\n*   `calculate_price_after_discount`: Calculates the price after applying the discount.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `DiscountCalculator` class by testing it with different prices and discount types.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can easily extend this code to support additional discount types by adding more entries to the `discounts` dictionary in the `DiscountCalculator` class.\n*   Consider adding input validation to handle cases where the price or discount type is invalid.\n*   You can also modify the code to use a more complex discount system, such as tiered discounts or discounts based on specific items.",
