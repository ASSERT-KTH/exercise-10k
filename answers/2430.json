  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program validates passwords based on the following criteria:\n\n* Length: at least 8 characters\n* Uppercase letters: at least one\n* Lowercase letters: at least one\n* Digits: at least one\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following criteria:\n    - Length: at least 8 characters\n    - Uppercase letters: at least one\n    - Lowercase letters: at least one\n    - Digits: at least one\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Check length\n        if len(password) < 8:\n            print(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n            password = input(\"Enter a new password: \")\n            continue\n\n        # Check for uppercase letters\n        if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n            print(\"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n            password = input(\"Enter a new password: \")\n            continue\n\n        # Check for lowercase letters\n        if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n            print(\"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n            password = input(\"Enter a new password: \")\n            continue\n\n        # Check for digits\n        if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n            print(\"Password must contain at least one digit.\")\n            password = input(\"Enter a new password: \")\n            continue\n\n        # If all checks pass, break out of the loop\n        break\n\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    validate_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `validate_password` function takes a password as input and checks it against the specified criteria.\n2. The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask for a new password until it meets all the criteria.\n3. Inside the loop, the function checks the length of the password, and if it's too short, it prints an error message and asks for a new password.\n4. The function then checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits using regular expressions. If any of these checks fail, it prints an error message and asks for a new password.\n5. If all checks pass, the function breaks out of the loop and prints a success message.\n6. The `main` function asks the user to enter a password and calls the `validate_password` function with the user's input.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a password that is too short (e.g., \"abc123\"):\n\t+ The program will print an error message and ask for a new password.\n* Enter a password that lacks uppercase letters (e.g., \"abcdefg1\"):\n\t+ The program will print an error message and ask for a new password.\n* Enter a password that lacks lowercase letters (e.g., \"ABCDEF1\"):\n\t+ The program will print an error message and ask for a new password.\n* Enter a password that lacks digits (e.g., \"Abcdefg\"):\n\t+ The program will print an error message and ask for a new password.\n* Enter a valid password (e.g., \"Abcdefg1\"):\n\t+ The program will print a success message.",
