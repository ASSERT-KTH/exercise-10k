  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and classifies it as positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements. The program should also check if the number is even or odd.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    std::cout << \"Enter an integer: \";\n    std::cin >> x;\n\n    if (x > 0) {\n        std::cout << x << \" is positive\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (x < 0) {\n        std::cout << x << \" is negative\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << x << \" is zero\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    if (x % 2 == 0) {\n        std::cout << x << \" is even\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << x << \" is odd\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code uses `std::cout` to print messages to the console, `std::cin` to read input from the user, and `int` to declare variables. It uses two `if` statements to classify the input integer as positive, negative, or zero, and to check if the number is even or odd. The code also uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `x` by 2.",
