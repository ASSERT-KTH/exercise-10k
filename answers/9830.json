  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then stores this information in variables. The program should then print out the data type of each variable.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name and age\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n# Try to convert age to an integer\ntry:\n    age = int(age)\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid age. Please enter a whole number.\")\nelse:\n    # Store the information in variables\n    user_info = {\n        \"name\": name,\n        \"age\": age\n    }\n\n    # Print out the data type of each variable\n    print(\"Data type of name: \", type(name))\n    print(\"Data type of age: \", type(age))\n```\n\nIn this program, we first ask the user for their name and age. We store this information in the `name` and `age` variables, respectively. We then try to convert the `age` to an integer, because `input()` in Python returns a string. If the conversion fails (i.e., if the user enters something that is not a whole number), we print an error message. If the conversion succeeds, we store the information in a dictionary and print out the data type of each variable. \n\nNote: In Python, the `input()` function always returns a string. If you want to store the age as an integer, you need to convert it manually, as shown in the program above. \n\nExample output:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 25\nData type of name:  <class 'str'>\nData type of age:  <class 'int'>\n```",
