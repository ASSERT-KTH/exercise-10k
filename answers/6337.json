The function iterates over the input list, checking if each item is a sublist or a non-list item. If an item is a sublist, the function calls itself recursively on that sublist and appends the result to the `flat_list`. If an item is not a sublist, it is appended to the `flat_list` directly. The function returns the `flat_list` once it has processed all items in the input list.",
