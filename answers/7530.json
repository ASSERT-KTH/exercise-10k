  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\n# Ask the user for their age\nage = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n\n# Print out a greeting message with their name\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# Calculate and print how old they will be in 5 years\nprint(f\"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.\")\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We use the built-in `input()` function to ask the user for their name and age. The `input()` function returns a string, so we use the `int()` function to convert the age to an integer.\n2. We use an f-string to print out a greeting message with the user's name. The `f` before the string indicates that it's an f-string, and the `{name}` inside the string is replaced with the value of the `name` variable.\n3. We calculate the user's age in 5 years by adding 5 to their current age, and print out the result using another f-string.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nWhat is your name? John\nHow old are you? 25\nHello, John!\nIn 5 years, you will be 30 years old.\n```",
