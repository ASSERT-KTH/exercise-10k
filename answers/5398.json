  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**\n================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Change this to generate a different number of Fibonacci numbers\n    print(generate_fibonacci(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `generate_fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n2. It handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n4. It then enters a loop, appending the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to `fib_sequence` until it reaches the desired length `n`.\n5. Finally, it returns the generated Fibonacci sequence as a list.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor `n = 10`, the output will be:\n```\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
