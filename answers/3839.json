  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula (e.g., Fibonacci sequence).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence formula:\n```\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\nfib_sequence = fibonacci(n)\nprint(fib_sequence)\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, which specifies the number of terms to generate in the sequence.\n2. The function initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n3. The function uses a `while` loop to generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers, starting from the third term.\n4. In each iteration, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the list.\n5. Once the list has `n` elements, the function returns the completed Fibonacci sequence.\n6. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `fibonacci` function with a specific value of `n` and print the resulting sequence.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specific value instead of a fixed number of terms, you can modify the `while` loop condition to check for a maximum value.\n* To generate the Fibonacci sequence recursively, you can define a recursive function that calls itself to compute the next term in the sequence.\n* To generate other types of sequences, such as the Lucas sequence or the Catalan numbers, you can modify the formula used to compute the next term in the sequence.",
