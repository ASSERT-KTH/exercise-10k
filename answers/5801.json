  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    even_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum += i\n    return even_sum\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to\", n, \"is:\", sum_even_numbers(n))\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `sum_even_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input. We initialize a variable `even_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of all even numbers. We then use a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`). If `i` is even, we add it to `even_sum`. Finally, we return `even_sum`.\n\nThe program then prompts the user to enter a number `n`, calls the `sum_even_numbers(n)` function, and prints the result.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter a number: 10\nThe sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30\n```\nThis is because the even numbers from 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, and their sum is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30.",
