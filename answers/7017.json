  "prompt": "Write a program to take two numbers as input from the user and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations based on the user's choice.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(num1, \"+\", num2, \"=\", num1 + num2)\n\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(num1, \"-\", num2, \"=\", num1 - num2)\n\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(num1, \"*\", num2, \"=\", num1 * num2)\n\n        elif choice == '4':\n            if num2 != 0:\n                print(num1, \"/\", num2, \"=\", num1 / num2)\n            else:\n                print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    again = input(\"Do you want to use the calculator again? (yes/no): \")\n    if again.lower() == 'yes':\n        main()\n    else:\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `calculator` function displays a simple menu for the user to choose an operation.\n2. The `main` function calls `calculator` and asks the user if they want to use the calculator again.\n3. If the user chooses to continue, `main` calls itself recursively. Otherwise, it prints a goodbye message and exits.\n4. The program handles invalid choices and division by zero errors.\n5. It uses `float` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers. \n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run this program, it will display a menu with four options. You can enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform, and then enter the two numbers. The program will display the result of the operation. You will then be asked if you want to use the calculator again. If you answer 'yes', the program will start over. If you answer 'no', it will print a goodbye message and exit.",
