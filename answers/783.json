  "answer": "Here's a Python program that evaluates a complex arithmetic expression using a stack-based approach:\n\n```Python\ndef evaluate_expression(expression):\n    # Initialize an empty stack\n    stack = []\n\n    # Iterate over the expression from left to right\n    for char in expression:\n        # If the character is a digit or a decimal point, treat it as part of a number\n        if char.isdigit() or char == '.':\n            if stack and isinstance(stack[-1], str) and (stack[-1].replace('.', '', 1).isdigit()):\n                stack[-1] += char\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n        # If the character is an operator, push it onto the stack\n        elif char in '+-*/':\n            stack.append(char)\n        # If the character is a closing parenthesis, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses\n        elif char == ')':\n            # Initialize an empty list to store the operands and operators inside the parentheses\n            temp_list = []\n            # Pop elements from the stack until we find the opening parenthesis\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':\n                temp_list.append(stack.pop())\n            # Remove the opening parenthesis from the stack\n            if stack and stack[-1] == '(':\n                stack.pop()\n            # Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses\n            temp_expression = ''.join(reversed(temp_list))\n            result = eval(temp_expression)\n            # Push the result onto the stack\n            stack.append(str(result))\n\n    # Evaluate the final expression\n    result = eval(''.join(stack))\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Test the function with a complex arithmetic expression\nexpression = \"10 + 20 * 3 - 4 / 2\"\nprint(\"Expression:\", expression)\nprint(\"Result:\", evaluate_expression(expression))\n```\n\nThis program uses a stack-based approach to evaluate the expression. It iterates over the expression from left to right, treating digits and decimal points as part of numbers, and operators as separate entities. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it evaluates the expression inside the parentheses using the `eval()` function and pushes the result onto the stack. Finally, it evaluates the final expression using the `eval()` function and returns the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Evaluating a simple arithmetic expression: `10 + 20`\n* Evaluating an expression with multiple operators: `10 + 20 * 3 - 4 / 2`\n* Evaluating an expression with parentheses: `(10 + 20) * 3 - 4 / 2`\n\n**Note:** The `eval()` function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input, as it can evaluate any Python expression. In a real-world application, you should use a safer evaluation method, such as using a parsing library or writing a custom parser.",
