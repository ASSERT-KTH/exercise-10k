  "answer": "**Most Frequent Character in a String**\n======================================\n\nThis program finds the most frequent character in a given string.\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most frequent character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): Input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (most_frequent_char, frequency)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Count character frequencies\n    char_counts = Counter(s)\n\n    # Find the most frequent character\n    most_frequent_char = max(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)\n\n    # Get its frequency\n    frequency = char_counts[most_frequent_char]\n\n    return most_frequent_char, frequency\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    most_frequent, frequency = most_frequent_char(input_str)\n    print(f\"Most frequent character: '{most_frequent}' (appears {frequency} times)\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `most_frequent_char` function takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It removes whitespace and converts the string to lowercase to ensure accurate counting.\n3. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character.\n4. It finds the most frequent character using the `max` function with a key function that returns the frequency of each character.\n5. It returns a tuple containing the most frequent character and its frequency.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `most_frequent_char` function.\n\n### Example Output\n```\nMost frequent character: 'l' (appears 3 times)\n```",
