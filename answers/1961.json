  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the power of a number. The function should take two arguments, the base and the exponent, and return the result.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the power of a number, addressing your request for a clear and structured solution. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the power of a number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    base (int or float): The base number.\n    exponent (int or float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int or float: The result of the base raised to the exponent.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # First, we check if the inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(base, (int, float)) or not isinstance(exponent, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both base and exponent must be numbers.\")\n    \n    # We use the built-in pow function in Python, which can handle large numbers efficiently.\n    # However, we could also use the ** operator, which is more readable and Pythonic.\n    # Here, we choose to use the ** operator for simplicity and readability.\n    result = base ** exponent\n    \n    # Finally, we return the result.\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculate_power(2, 3))  # Output: 8\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_power` takes two arguments, `base` and `exponent`, and first checks if both are numbers using `isinstance`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then calculates the power using the `**` operator, which is a more readable and Pythonic way to perform exponentiation, and stores the result in the `result` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated `result`.\n* Example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the `calculate_power` function, such as calculating 2 to the power of 3, which correctly outputs 8.",
