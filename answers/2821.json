  "prompt": "Create a program to determine a student's grade based on their marks. If the marks are above 90, the grade is A. If the marks are between 80 and 90, the grade is B. If the marks are between 70 and 80, the grade is C. If the marks are between 60 and 70, the grade is D. If the marks are below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that can determine a student's grade based on their marks:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(marks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the marks.\n\n    Args:\n        marks (float): The marks obtained by the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if marks > 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif marks >= 80 and marks <= 90:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif marks >= 70 and marks < 80:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif marks >= 60 and marks < 70:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the marks from the user\n    marks = float(input(\"Enter the marks: \"))\n\n    # Validate the marks\n    if marks < 0 or marks > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid marks. Please enter marks between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate and display the grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(marks)\n        print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes the marks as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n2. The `main` function gets the marks from the user, validates them to ensure they are between 0 and 100, and then calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function.\n3. Finally, the program displays the grade to the user.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* If the user enters 95, the program will display \"Grade: A\".\n* If the user enters 85, the program will display \"Grade: B\".\n* If the user enters 75, the program will display \"Grade: C\".\n* If the user enters 65, the program will display \"Grade: D\".\n* If the user enters 55, the program will display \"Grade: F\".",
