  "answer": "**Sentence Splitter Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns a list of sentences. It uses the `nltk` library to split the input string into sentences.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n\ndef split_into_sentences(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split a given text into a list of sentences.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sentences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Download the required NLTK data if not already downloaded\n    nltk.download('punkt')\n    \n    # Split the text into sentences\n    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n    \n    return sentences\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = \"Hello world! This is a test. How are you?\"\n    sentences = split_into_sentences(text)\n    print(sentences)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program starts by importing the required libraries: `nltk` and `sent_tokenize` from `nltk.tokenize`.\n2. The `split_into_sentences` function takes a string as input and returns a list of sentences.\n3. Inside the function, it downloads the required NLTK data if not already downloaded using `nltk.download('punkt')`.\n4. It then splits the input text into sentences using `sent_tokenize(text)`.\n5. The function returns the list of sentences.\n6. In the example usage, we define a test string and pass it to the `split_into_sentences` function.\n7. The resulting list of sentences is printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```python\n['Hello world!', 'This is a test.', 'How are you?']\n```\n\nNote: Make sure you have the `nltk` library installed by running `pip install nltk` in your terminal before running this program.",
