  "answer": "### Student Information Storage and Printing\n#### Python Solution\n\n```python\n# Declare variables to store a student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We declare two variables, `student_name` and `student_age`, to store the student's name and age, respectively.\n2. The `print()` function is used to output the values of these variables.\n3. The `print()` function can take multiple arguments, which are separated by commas. In this case, we pass a string literal and the variable value to be printed.\n\n#### Running the Code\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```",
