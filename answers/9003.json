  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition, addressing your request for a comprehensive solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.\ndef compose(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.\n\n    Args:\n        f (function): The first function.\n        g (function): The second function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We want to return a new function that takes an argument x and applies g to x, then applies f to the result.\n    # So, we define a new function inside our compose function.\n    def composed_function(x):\n        \n        # First, we apply g to x.\n        intermediate_result = g(x)\n        \n        # Then, we apply f to the intermediate result.\n        final_result = f(intermediate_result)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the final result.\n        return final_result\n    \n    # We return the composed function.\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions.\ndouble_then_add_one = compose(add_one, double)\n\n# Use the composed function.\nresult = double_then_add_one(5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose` function is defined to take two functions `f` and `g` as arguments and returns a new function `composed_function`. This new function applies `g` to an input `x`, then applies `f` to the result.\n* Inside `composed_function`, `g` is applied to `x` and the result is stored in `intermediate_result`. Then, `f` is applied to `intermediate_result` and the final result is stored in `final_result`.\n* The `composed_function` is then returned by `compose`, allowing for the composition of `f` and `g` to be used like any other function.\n* In the example usage, `double` and `add_one` functions are composed using `compose`, resulting in a new function `double_then_add_one` that doubles its input and then adds one.",
