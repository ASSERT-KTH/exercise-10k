  "answer": "**Generator Function to Produce Sequence of Numbers**\n======================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that utilizes generators to produce a sequence of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(start, end, step=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        start (int): The starting number of the sequence.\n        end (int): The ending number of the sequence.\n        step (int, optional): The difference between each number in the sequence. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    current = start\n    while current <= end:\n        yield current\n        current += step\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Generating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 1:\")\n    for num in generate_sequence(1, 10):\n        print(num)\n\n    print(\"\\nGenerating sequence from 1 to 10 with a step of 2:\")\n    for num in generate_sequence(1, 10, step=2):\n        print(num)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n---------------\n\n1. The `generate_sequence` function takes three parameters: `start`, `end`, and `step`.\n2. The `start` parameter specifies the starting number of the sequence.\n3. The `end` parameter specifies the ending number of the sequence.\n4. The `step` parameter (optional, defaulting to 1) specifies the difference between each number in the sequence.\n5. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate from `start` to `end`, incrementing by `step` each time.\n6. The `yield` statement is used to produce the next number in the sequence, allowing the function to remember its state and pick up where it left off on subsequent calls.\n7. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `generate_sequence` function to produce sequences with different steps.",
