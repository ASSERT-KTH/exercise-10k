  "answer": "### Accessing and Printing a Dictionary Value by Key\n\nHere's a simple function in Python that takes a dictionary and a key as input, accesses the corresponding value, and prints it.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Access and print a dictionary value by its key.\n    \n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key (any): The key of the value to access.\n    \n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        value = dictionary[key]\n        print(f\"The value for key '{key}' is: {value}\")\n    except KeyError:\n        print(f\"Key '{key}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n    key_to_access = \"age\"\n    \n    print_dict_value(example_dict, key_to_access)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `print_dict_value` is defined to take two parameters: `dictionary` and `key`.\n2. **Accessing the Value**: Inside the function, we use a try-except block to handle the case where the key does not exist in the dictionary. We access the value using `dictionary[key]`.\n3. **Printing the Value**: If the key exists, we print the corresponding value.\n4. **Error Handling**: If the key does not exist, a `KeyError` exception is raised, and we catch it to print a message indicating that the key was not found.\n5. **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we demonstrate how to use the `print_dict_value` function with an example dictionary and key.\n\nThis function is straightforward and handles the potential error of accessing a non-existent key, making it a safe and reliable way to print dictionary values by their keys.",
