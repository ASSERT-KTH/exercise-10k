  "prompt": "Create a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should have a specified number of rows, and each row should have a specified number of asterisks. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 3 asterisks per row, the program should print a pattern with 5 rows, each containing 3 asterisks. Use loops (for/while) to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_asterisk_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of asterisks based on user input.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get the number of rows from the user\n    num_rows = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    \n    # Get the number of asterisks per row from the user\n    num_asterisks = int(input(\"Enter the number of asterisks per row: \"))\n    \n    # Use a for loop to print each row\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        # Use a for loop to print each asterisk in the row\n        for j in range(num_asterisks):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        # Move to the next line after printing each row\n        print()\n\n# Call the function to start the program\nprint_asterisk_pattern()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `print_asterisk_pattern()` that contains the main logic.\n2. It prompts the user to input the number of rows and the number of asterisks per row using the `input()` function.\n3. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of rows specified by the user.\n4. Inside the outer loop, it uses another `for` loop to iterate over the range of asterisks specified by the user for each row.\n5. Inside the inner loop, it prints an asterisk (*) followed by a space using the `print()` function with the `end` parameter set to `\" \"`. This ensures that all asterisks in a row are printed on the same line.\n6. After printing each row, the program moves to the next line using the `print()` function without any arguments.\n7. Finally, the program calls the `print_asterisk_pattern()` function to start the execution.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the number of rows and the number of asterisks per row. For example, if you input `5` rows and `3` asterisks per row, the program will print the following pattern:\n```\n* * * \n* * * \n* * * \n* * * \n* * * \n```",
