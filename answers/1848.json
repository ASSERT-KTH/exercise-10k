  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers and a function as input, and returns the result of applying the function to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the third element, and so on, until only one element remains.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef foldl(f, l):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies function f to the first two elements of list l, then to the result and the next element, and so on.\n\n    Args:\n        f (function): A function that takes two arguments.\n        l (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of the function application.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(l) == 1:\n        return l[0]\n    else:\n        return foldl(f, [f(l[0], l[1])] + l[2:])\n\n# Example usage\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef mul(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult_add = foldl(add, numbers)\nresult_mul = foldl(mul, numbers)\n\nprint(result_add)  # Output: 15\nprint(result_mul)  # Output: 120\n```\nI've implemented the `foldl` function as specified, and included the example usage with the `add` and `mul` functions. The `foldl` function takes a function `f` and a list `l` as input, and applies the function to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on. The base case is when the list has only one element, in which case it simply returns that element.",
