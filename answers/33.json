  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n=========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first integer.\n    b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6\n    print(gcd(54, 24))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the GCD.\n3. The algorithm iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes zero.\n4. At this point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n5. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This implementation has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it efficient for large inputs.\n* The function assumes that the input integers are non-zero. If zero is a possible input, additional error handling may be necessary.",
