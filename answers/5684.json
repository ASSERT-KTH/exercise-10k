  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates tax based on income using conditional statements.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate tax\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    if income <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif income <= 10000:\n        return income * 0.05  # 5% tax for income up to $10,000\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        return (10000 * 0.05) + ((income - 10000) * 0.10)  # 10% tax for income between $10,001 and $20,000\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 20000) * 0.15)  # 15% tax for income between $20,001 and $50,000\n    elif income <= 75000:\n        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + ((income - 50000) * 0.20)  # 20% tax for income between $50,001 and $75,000\n    else:\n        return (10000 * 0.05) + (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + (25000 * 0.20) + ((income - 75000) * 0.25)  # 25% tax for income above $75,000\n\n# Take income as input\nincome = float(input(\"Enter your income: \"))\n\n# Calculate tax\ntax = calculate_tax(income)\n\n# Print tax\nprint(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_tax` that takes income as input and calculates tax based on the income level. The tax rates used in this example are:\n\n* 5% for income up to $10,000\n* 10% for income between $10,001 and $20,000\n* 15% for income between $20,001 and $50,000\n* 20% for income between $50,001 and $75,000\n* 25% for income above $75,000\n\nThe program then takes income as input, calculates tax using the `calculate_tax` function, and prints the tax amount.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Enter an income of $15,000 to calculate a tax of $700 (5% of $10,000 + 10% of $5,000).\n* Enter an income of $30,000 to calculate a tax of $2,000 (5% of $10,000 + 10% of $10,000 + 15% of $10,000).\n* Enter an income of $100,000 to calculate a tax of $18,250 (5% of $10,000 + 10% of $10,000 + 15% of $30,000 + 20% of $25,000 + 25% of $25,000).",
