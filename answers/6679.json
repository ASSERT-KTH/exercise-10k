  "answer": "**Calculating the Surface Area of a Sphere**\n=====================================================\n\nThe surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\n`A = 4 * \u03c0 * r^2`\n\nwhere `A` is the surface area and `r` is the radius of the sphere.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n------------------------\n\nHere is a Python program to calculate the surface area of a sphere:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_surface_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a sphere.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\n# Example usage:\nradius = 5\nsurface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)\nprint(f\"The surface area of the sphere with radius {radius} is {surface_area:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_surface_area` function takes the radius of the sphere as an argument.\n2. It checks if the radius is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It calculates the surface area using the formula `A = 4 * \u03c0 * r^2`.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n5. In the example usage, we call the function with a radius of 5 and print the result to the console.\n\n**Note**\n-------\n\n* The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the mathematical constant pi.\n* The `**` operator is used to calculate the square of the radius.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to round the result to two decimal places.",
