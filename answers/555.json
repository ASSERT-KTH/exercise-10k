  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem using Run-Length Encoding (RLE):\n\n```python\ndef compress_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the compressed string using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string to be compressed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The compressed string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not input_str:\n        return \"\"\n\n    compressed = []\n    current_char = input_str[0]\n    count = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the input string from the second character to the end\n    for char in input_str[1:]:\n        if char == current_char:\n            # If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the count\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            # If the current character is different from the previous one, append the previous character and count to the compressed list\n            compressed.append(current_char + str(count))\n            current_char = char\n            count = 1\n\n    # Append the last character and count to the compressed list\n    compressed.append(current_char + str(count))\n\n    # Join the compressed list into a string and return it\n    return \"\".join(compressed)\n\n\n# Test the function\ninput_str = \"AAABBBCCCDDDD\"\nprint(\"Input String: \", input_str)\nprint(\"Compressed String: \", compress_string(input_str))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   We create an empty list called `compressed` to store the compressed characters and their counts.\n*   We initialize the `current_char` variable with the first character of the input string and set the `count` to 1.\n*   We then iterate over the input string from the second character to the end. If the current character is the same as the previous one, we increment the `count`. If the current character is different from the previous one, we append the previous character and count to the `compressed` list and reset the `count` to 1.\n*   After the loop, we append the last character and count to the `compressed` list.\n*   Finally, we join the `compressed` list into a string and return it as the compressed string.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating over the input string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst-case scenario (when all characters are unique), the length of the compressed string can be twice the length of the input string.",
