  "prompt": "Create a program that acts as a simple calculator and performs different operations based on user input using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple calculator program implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(num1, \"+\", num2, \"=\", num1 + num2)\n\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(num1, \"-\", num2, \"=\", num1 - num2)\n\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(num1, \"*\", num2, \"=\", num1 * num2)\n\n        elif choice == '4':\n            if num2 != 0:\n                print(num1, \"/\", num2, \"=\", num1 / num2)\n            else:\n                print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    while True:\n        repeat = input(\"Do you want to calculate again? (yes/no): \")\n        if repeat.lower() == 'yes':\n            calculator()\n        elif repeat.lower() == 'no':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Menu Display**: The calculator displays a simple menu for the user to select their desired mathematical operation.\n2. **User Input**: The user enters their choice of operation and two numbers.\n3. **Operation Execution**: Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding mathematical operation and prints the result.\n4. **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling, such as checking for division by zero.\n5. **Repeat Option**: After each calculation, the user is asked if they want to calculate again. If yes, the program restarts; otherwise, it exits.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n- Addition: Enter `1` as your choice, then enter two numbers, e.g., `5` and `3`. The program will output `5 + 3 = 8.0`.\n- Division: Enter `4` as your choice, then enter two numbers, e.g., `10` and `2`. The program will output `10 / 2 = 5.0`. If you try to divide by zero, it will display an error message.",
