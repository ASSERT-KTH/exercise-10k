  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function that returns a closure with access to its own scope. This will involve defining a function within another function and using variables from the outer function in the inner function. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns a closure that has access to its own scope.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A closure with access to its own scope.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a variable in the outer function's scope\n    outer_variable = 10\n    \n    # Define the inner function\n    def inner_function():\n        # The inner function can access the outer function's scope\n        nonlocal outer_variable  # Use nonlocal keyword to modify the variable from the outer scope\n        \n        # Print the value of the outer variable\n        print(\"Outer variable:\", outer_variable)\n        \n        # Modify the outer variable\n        outer_variable += 1\n        \n        # Print the modified value of the outer variable\n        print(\"Modified outer variable:\", outer_variable)\n    \n    # Return the inner function as a closure\n    return inner_function\n\n# Create a closure by calling the outer function\nclosure = outer_function()\n\n# Call the closure\nclosure()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define an `outer_function` that creates a variable `outer_variable` in its scope and returns an `inner_function` as a closure. This `inner_function` can access and modify the `outer_variable` using the `nonlocal` keyword.\n*   Within the `inner_function`, we print the initial value of `outer_variable`, modify it, and then print the modified value. This demonstrates that the closure has access to its own scope.\n*   We create a closure by calling `outer_function()` and assign it to the `closure` variable. Finally, we call the `closure()` to execute the `inner_function` and observe the access to its own scope.",
