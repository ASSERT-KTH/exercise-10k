  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef power(x, n):\n    res = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        res *= x\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    x = 2\n    n = 3\n    print(f'{x}^{n} = {power(x, n)}')\n\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `power` function, which takes two parameters `x` and `n`, and returns the result of raising `x` to the power of `n`. The `main` function calls the `power` function with the arguments `x=2` and `n=3`, and prints the result. The program can be run by executing the `main` function.",
