  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a bank account, allowing the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that simulates a bank account:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.balance = 0.0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Your current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g. `bank_account.py`) and run it using Python (e.g. `python bank_account.py`).\n\n1. The program will display a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.\n2. Enter your choice by typing the corresponding number.\n3. If you choose to deposit or withdraw, enter the amount when prompted.\n4. The program will update your balance and display the new balance after each transaction.\n5. To exit the program, choose the \"Exit\" option.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `BankAccount` class to encapsulate the account's balance and methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n* The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` object and provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the account.\n* The program uses `float` to represent the balance and transaction amounts, allowing for decimal values.\n* The program checks for invalid input (e.g. negative amounts, non-numeric input) and displays error messages accordingly.",
