  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Program in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using a nested for loop to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Iterate over the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            # Traverse the list from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n\n    return numbers\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  It iterates over the list using a nested for loop.\n3.  In each iteration, it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n4.  The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list.\n5.  The inner loop runs `n-i-1` times, where `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop.\n6.  After each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element is \"bubbled\" to the end of the list.\n7.  The function returns the sorted list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nOriginal list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of items being sorted. However, with certain optimizations, it can be O(n) in the best case (when the input list is already sorted).",
