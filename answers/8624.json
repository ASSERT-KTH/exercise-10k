  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character. If no such character exists, it returns `None`.\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the first non-repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"aabbc\"\n    result = first_non_repeating_char(input_str)\n    print(f\"First non-repeating character: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the input string.\n2. We then iterate over the input string, checking the count of each character in the `Counter` object.\n3. If we find a character with a count of 1, we return it immediately.\n4. If we reach the end of the string without finding a non-repeating character, we return `None`.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\n* The `Counter` object is used to efficiently count the occurrences of each character.\n* The program returns the first non-repeating character it finds, not necessarily the only one. If you need to find all non-repeating characters, you can modify the program to return a list of such characters instead.",
