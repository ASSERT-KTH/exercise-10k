  "answer": "**Finding the Biggest of Four Numbers**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that takes four numbers as input and prints out the biggest of the four.\n\n```python\ndef find_biggest(num1, num2, num3, num4):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes four numbers as input and returns the biggest one.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        num3 (float): The third number.\n        num4 (float): The fourth number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The biggest of the four numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return max(num1, num2, num3, num4)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the four numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n    num4 = float(input(\"Enter the fourth number: \"))\n\n    # Find and print the biggest number\n    biggest = find_biggest(num1, num2, num3, num4)\n    print(f\"The biggest number is: {biggest}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `find_biggest` function takes four numbers as input and uses the built-in `max` function to find the biggest one.\n2. The `main` function gets the four numbers from the user, calls `find_biggest` to find the biggest number, and then prints it out.\n3. The program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 20\nEnter the third number: 30\nEnter the fourth number: 40\nThe biggest number is: 40.0\n```",
