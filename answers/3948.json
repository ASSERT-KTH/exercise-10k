  "answer": "**Dice Game Simulator**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a game where two players take turns rolling a dice. The first player to roll a 6 wins.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    \"\"\"Simulate a dice roll and return the result.\"\"\"\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"Simulate the game and return the winner.\"\"\"\n    player_turn = \"Player 1\"\n    while True:\n        input(f\"{player_turn}, press Enter to roll the dice...\")\n        roll = roll_dice()\n        print(f\"{player_turn} rolled a {roll}\")\n        if roll == 6:\n            return player_turn\n        player_turn = \"Player 2\" if player_turn == \"Player 1\" else \"Player 1\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Run the game and print the winner.\"\"\"\n    winner = game()\n    print(f\"{winner} wins!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `roll_dice` function simulates a dice roll by generating a random number between 1 and 6.\n2. The `game` function simulates the game by alternating between two players.\n3. In each turn, the player is prompted to press Enter to roll the dice.\n4. The roll result is printed, and if it's 6, the game ends and the winner is returned.\n5. The `main` function runs the game and prints the winner.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program and follow the prompts to play the game. For example:\n```\nPlayer 1, press Enter to roll the dice...\nPlayer 1 rolled a 3\nPlayer 2, press Enter to roll the dice...\nPlayer 2 rolled a 2\nPlayer 1, press Enter to roll the dice...\nPlayer 1 rolled a 6\nPlayer 1 wins!\n```",
