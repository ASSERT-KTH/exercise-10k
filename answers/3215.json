  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Get two numbers from the user\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two numbers as input and returns their LCM.\n2. The LCM is calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.\n3. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the GCD.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter two numbers.\n5. The LCM is calculated and printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter two numbers when prompted. For example, if you enter `12` and `15`, the program will output `The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60`.",
