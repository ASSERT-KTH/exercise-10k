  "answer": "**Arithmetic Operation Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes two numbers and an operator as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The arithmetic operator. Can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Must be one of '+', '-', '*', '/'.\")\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\n    print(arithmetic_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses simple conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the input operator. It also includes error checking to ensure that the operator is valid and that division by zero does not occur.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always validate user input to prevent unexpected behavior.\n* Use clear and descriptive variable names to improve code readability.\n* Consider using a dictionary or other data structure to map operators to their corresponding functions for more complex operations.",
