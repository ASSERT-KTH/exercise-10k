  "answer": "**Character Occurrence Counter Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a character as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_char_occurrences(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to count occurrences of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    occurrences = count_char_occurrences(string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string '{string}'.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `count_char_occurrences` takes two arguments: `string` and `char`.\n*   It uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings to count the occurrences of `char` in `string`.\n*   The result is returned as an integer.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the function to count the occurrences of the character \"l\" in the string \"Hello, World!\".",
