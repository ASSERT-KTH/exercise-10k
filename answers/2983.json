  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in a List of Numbers**\n\nBelow is a Python solution that uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. This approach allows us to find the first duplicate in a list of numbers efficiently.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or None: The first duplicate number, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nfirst_duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\nif first_duplicate is not None:\n    print(f\"The first duplicate is: {first_duplicate}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n```\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we've seen so far.\n2. We iterate over the input list `numbers`.\n3. For each number, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, we return the number as the first duplicate.\n5. If it's not, we add the number to the `seen` set.\n6. If we reach the end of the list without finding a duplicate, we return None.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input list.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input list. In the worst case, we might need to store all numbers in the `seen` set.",
