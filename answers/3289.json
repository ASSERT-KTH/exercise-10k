  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function called `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. **Initialize total**: We initialize a variable called `total` to zero. This variable will store the sum of all numbers in the list.\n3. **Loop through numbers**: We use a `for` loop to iterate over each number in the list.\n4. **Add to total**: Inside the loop, we add each number to the `total`.\n5. **Calculate average**: After the loop, we calculate the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements).\n6. **Return average**: We return the calculated average.\n7. **Test the function**: We create a list of numbers, call the `calculate_average` function, and print the result.\n\n### Example output:\n```\nThe average is: 3.0\n```\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. You may want to add error handling to handle this case.",
