  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and repeat, with each repetition increasing by 1. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. If the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the pattern of numbers as described:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of numbers that starts with 1 and repeats, \n    with each repetition increasing by 1.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number that determines the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize variables\n    i = 1\n    \n    # Loop to print the increasing part of the pattern\n    while i <= n:\n        print(i, end=', ')  # Print the current number\n        i += 1  # Increment the counter\n    \n    # Reset the counter for the decreasing part of the pattern\n    i = n - 1\n    \n    # Loop to print the decreasing part of the pattern\n    while i >= 1:\n        print(i, end=', ')  # Print the current number\n        i -= 1  # Decrement the counter\n\n# Test the function\nprint_pattern(5)\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, \n```\n\nThis program defines a function `print_pattern(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the pattern of numbers as described. It uses two while loops: one to print the increasing part of the pattern and another to print the decreasing part. The `end=', '` argument in the `print()` function is used to separate the numbers with a comma and a space.",
