  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period of the investment (in years).\n        frequency (int): The number of times interest is compounded per year.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final amount after compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    final_amount = principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)\n    return final_amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (per year): \"))\n\n    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)\n    interest_earned = final_amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Amount: ${final_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount: `$1000`\n3. Enter the annual interest rate: `5`\n4. Enter the time period: `10`\n5. Enter the compounding frequency: `12` (monthly compounding)\n\nThe program will calculate and display the final amount and interest earned.\n\n**Output**\n--------\n\n```\nCompound Interest Calculator\n--------------------------------\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the annual interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 10\nEnter the compounding frequency (per year): 12\n\nFinal Amount: $1638.62\nInterest Earned: $638.62\n```\n\nNote: This program uses the formula for compound interest: `A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where:\n* `A` is the final amount\n* `P` is the principal amount\n* `r` is the annual interest rate\n* `n` is the compounding frequency per year\n* `t` is the time period in years",
