  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. The program should take the year as input and print 'True' if it is a leap year, 'False' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef is_leap(year):\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nyear = int(input())\nprint(is_leap(year))\n```\nThis code defines the `is_leap` function, which checks if a given year is a leap year using the rules specified. It then reads a year from the user, calls the `is_leap` function with that year, and prints the result.",
