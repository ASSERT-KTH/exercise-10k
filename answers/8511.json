  "prompt": "Write a program to add two numbers and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that adds two numbers and prints the result:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    result = num1 + num2\n    return result\n\nnum1 = 5\nnum2 = 10\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and returns the result. It then calls this function with the numbers 5 and 10, and prints the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe sum of 5 and 10 is: 15\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see this program in a different language!",
