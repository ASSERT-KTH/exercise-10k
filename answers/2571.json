  "answer": "**Printing the First N Natural Numbers using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that prints the first n natural numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_natural_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the first n natural numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of natural numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    n = 10  # Change this to print a different number of natural numbers\n    print(f\"Printing the first {n} natural numbers:\")\n    print_natural_numbers(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n\n*   The `print_natural_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` natural numbers.\n*   The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   The for loop iterates over this sequence and prints each number.\n*   In the `main` function, you can change the value of `n` to print a different number of natural numbers.\n\n**Example Output**\n\n```\nPrinting the first 10 natural numbers:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```",
