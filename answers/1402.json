  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate and print the student's grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"Student's grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the student's score when prompted (e.g., 85).\n3. The program will print the student's grade (e.g., B).\n\n### Notes\n* The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n* The `main` function gets the student's score, validates it, calculates the grade, and prints the result.\n* The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on the score.",
