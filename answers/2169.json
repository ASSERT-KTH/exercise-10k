  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple Calculator**\n\nTo calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Ask the user for two numbers.\n2. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.\n3. Use the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)` to calculate the LCM.\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the least common multiple\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for two numbers\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 12\nEnter the second number: 15\nThe least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\nTo run this code, save it to a file (e.g., `lcm_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python lcm_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter two numbers, and the program will print their LCM.",
