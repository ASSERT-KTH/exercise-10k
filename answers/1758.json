  "answer": "**Array Difference Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two arrays, returning a new array containing elements that are in the first array but not in the second.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef array_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array containing elements that are in arr1 but not in arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in arr1 if element not in arr2]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n\n    difference = array_difference(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Difference:\", difference)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `array_difference` function takes two lists as input: `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `arr1`.\n3. For each element, it checks if the element is not present in `arr2` using the `not in` operator.\n4. If the element is not in `arr2`, it is included in the new list.\n5. The function returns the new list containing the difference between `arr1` and `arr2`.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nDifference: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the `not in` operator. For larger arrays, a more efficient approach using sets or numpy arrays may be necessary.",
