  "answer": "**Linear Regression Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the regression line of two sets of numbers using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef calculate_regression_line(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the regression line of two sets of numbers.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (list): Independent variable values\n    y (list): Dependent variable values\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: Slope and intercept of the regression line\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert lists to numpy arrays\n    x = np.array(x)\n    y = np.array(y)\n\n    # Calculate the mean of x and y\n    x_mean = np.mean(x)\n    y_mean = np.mean(y)\n\n    # Calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line\n    numerator = np.sum((x - x_mean) * (y - y_mean))\n    denominator = np.sum((x - x_mean) ** 2)\n    slope = numerator / denominator\n    intercept = y_mean - slope * x_mean\n\n    return slope, intercept\n\ndef plot_regression_line(x, y, slope, intercept):\n    \"\"\"\n    Plot the regression line.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (list): Independent variable values\n    y (list): Dependent variable values\n    slope (float): Slope of the regression line\n    intercept (float): Intercept of the regression line\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate x values for the regression line\n    x_reg = np.linspace(min(x), max(x), 100)\n\n    # Calculate corresponding y values for the regression line\n    y_reg = slope * x_reg + intercept\n\n    # Plot the data points and the regression line\n    plt.scatter(x, y)\n    plt.plot(x_reg, y_reg, 'r')\n    plt.show()\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\n    slope, intercept = calculate_regression_line(x, y)\n    print(f\"Regression line: y = {slope:.2f}x + {intercept:.2f}\")\n\n    plot_regression_line(x, y, slope, intercept)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses the following steps to calculate the regression line:\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean of x and y**: The mean of the independent variable `x` and the dependent variable `y` are calculated using the `np.mean()` function.\n2.  **Calculate the slope and intercept**: The slope and intercept of the regression line are calculated using the formulas for the OLS method.\n3.  **Plot the regression line**: The regression line is plotted using `matplotlib`, along with the data points.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use this program, simply replace the example `x` and `y` values in the `main()` function with your own data. The program will calculate and display the regression line, along with a plot of the data points and the regression line.\n\n**Note**: This program assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the relationship is non-linear, a different regression method may be necessary.",
