  "answer": "### Interleaving Two Arrays\n#### Problem Statement\nCreate a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a single array containing the elements of both arrays, interleaved.\n\n#### Solution\n```python\nfrom itertools import zip_longest\n\ndef interleave_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Interleaves two arrays into a single array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A single array containing the elements of both arrays, interleaved.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use zip_longest to iterate over both arrays, filling in None for shorter arrays\n    return [item for pair in zip_longest(arr1, arr2) for item in pair if item is not None]\n\n# Example usage\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\narr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n\nresult = interleave_arrays(arr1, arr2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c', 'd']\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   We use the `zip_longest` function from the `itertools` module to iterate over both arrays in parallel.\n*   The `zip_longest` function fills in `None` for the shorter array when one array is longer than the other.\n*   We then use a list comprehension to flatten the pairs of elements into a single list, excluding `None` values.\n*   The resulting list contains the elements of both arrays, interleaved.\n\n#### Notes\n*   This implementation assumes that the input arrays are lists in Python.\n*   If the arrays are of different lengths, the remaining elements from the longer array will be appended to the end of the result.",
