  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width. The program should use the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width) to calculate the perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int length, width, perimeter;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the length of the rectangle: \";\n    cin >> length;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the width of the rectangle: \";\n    cin >> width;\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width);\n\n    cout << \"The perimeter of the rectangle is: \" << perimeter << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `iostream` header file, uses the `using namespace std;` directive, and defines the `main()` function as specified. It also declares the variables `length`, `width`, and `perimeter` as integers, reads user input for `length` and `width`, calculates the `perimeter` using the formula, and displays the result to the user. Finally, it returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution.",
