  "prompt": "Given a dictionary with names of books as keys and their authors as values, write a program to iterate through the dictionary and print each key-value pair.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with book names as keys and authors as values\nbooks = {\n    \"To Kill a Mockingbird\": \"Harper Lee\",\n    \"1984\": \"George Orwell\",\n    \"Pride and Prejudice\": \"Jane Austen\",\n    \"The Great Gatsby\": \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\",\n    \"The Catcher in the Rye\": \"J.D. Salinger\"\n}\n\n# Iterate through the dictionary and print each key-value pair\nfor book, author in books.items():\n    print(f\"Book: {book}, Author: {author}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*   We define a dictionary called `books` where each key is a book name and each value is the corresponding author.\n*   We use the `.items()` method to iterate through the dictionary. This method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.\n*   Inside the loop, we print each key-value pair. The `f-string` formatting is used to create a readable string with the book name and author.\n\n**Example Output**\n\n```\nBook: To Kill a Mockingbird, Author: Harper Lee\nBook: 1984, Author: George Orwell\nBook: Pride and Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen\nBook: The Great Gatsby, Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald\nBook: The Catcher in the Rye, Author: J.D. Salinger\n```\n\nYou can run this program in a Python environment to see the output. Make sure to have Python installed on your system.",
