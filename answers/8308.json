  "answer": "### Student Grades Dictionary\n\nBelow is a Python implementation that uses a dictionary to store student grades and provides functions to add a student, add a grade to a student, and calculate the average grade of a student.\n\n```python\nclass StudentGrades:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.student_grades = {}\n\n    def add_student(self, name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add a student to the dictionary.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name of the student.\n        \"\"\"\n        if name not in self.student_grades:\n            self.student_grades[name] = []\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' already exists.\")\n\n    def add_grade(self, name, grade):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add a grade to a student's list of grades.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name of the student.\n            grade (float): The grade to be added.\n        \"\"\"\n        if name in self.student_grades:\n            self.student_grades[name].append(grade)\n            print(f\"Grade '{grade}' added to student '{name}'.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist. Please add the student first.\")\n\n    def calculate_average_grade(self, name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the average grade of a student.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name of the student.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The average grade of the student.\n        \"\"\"\n        if name in self.student_grades:\n            if self.student_grades[name]:\n                average_grade = sum(self.student_grades[name]) / len(self.student_grades[name])\n                return average_grade\n            else:\n                print(f\"Student '{name}' has no grades.\")\n                return None\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist.\")\n            return None\n\n    def print_student_grades(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print the grades of all students.\n        \"\"\"\n        for name, grades in self.student_grades.items():\n            print(f\"Student: {name}, Grades: {grades}\")\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    student_grades = StudentGrades()\n\n    # Add students\n    student_grades.add_student(\"John Doe\")\n    student_grades.add_student(\"Jane Doe\")\n\n    # Add grades to students\n    student_grades.add_grade(\"John Doe\", 85)\n    student_grades.add_grade(\"John Doe\", 90)\n    student_grades.add_grade(\"Jane Doe\", 78)\n    student_grades.add_grade(\"Jane Doe\", 92)\n\n    # Calculate average grades\n    print(f\"Average grade of John Doe: {student_grades.calculate_average_grade('John Doe')}\")\n    print(f\"Average grade of Jane Doe: {student_grades.calculate_average_grade('Jane Doe')}\")\n\n    # Print student grades\n    student_grades.print_student_grades()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a class `StudentGrades` to encapsulate the student grades dictionary and related methods.\n*   The `add_student` method adds a student to the dictionary with an empty list of grades.\n*   The `add_grade` method appends a grade to a student's list of grades.\n*   The `calculate_average_grade` method calculates the average grade of a student by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n*   The `print_student_grades` method prints the grades of all students.\n*   In the example usage, we create an instance of `StudentGrades`, add students, add grades to students, calculate average grades, and print student grades.",
