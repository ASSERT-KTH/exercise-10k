  "answer": "**Coin Change Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount using a set of predefined coin denominations.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_coin_change(amount):\n    # Define the available coin denominations\n    coin_denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]\n\n    # Initialize the coin change dictionary\n    coin_change = {\n        \"quarters\": 0,\n        \"dimes\": 0,\n        \"nickels\": 0,\n        \"pennies\": 0\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the coin change\n    for i, denomination in enumerate(coin_denominations):\n        if denomination == 25:\n            coin_change[\"quarters\"] = amount // denomination\n            amount %= denomination\n        elif denomination == 10:\n            coin_change[\"dimes\"] = amount // denomination\n            amount %= denomination\n        elif denomination == 5:\n            coin_change[\"nickels\"] = amount // denomination\n            amount %= denomination\n        elif denomination == 1:\n            coin_change[\"pennies\"] = amount // denomination\n            amount %= denomination\n\n    return coin_change\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the amount from the user\n    amount = int(input(\"Enter the amount in cents: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the coin change\n    coin_change = calculate_coin_change(amount)\n\n    # Print the coin change\n    print(\"Coin Change:\")\n    print(f\"Quarters: {coin_change['quarters']}\")\n    print(f\"Dimes: {coin_change['dimes']}\")\n    print(f\"Nickels: {coin_change['nickels']}\")\n    print(f\"Pennies: {coin_change['pennies']}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter the amount in cents: 37\n    *   Coin Change:\n        *   Quarters: 1\n        *   Dimes: 1\n        *   Nickels: 0\n        *   Pennies: 2\n*   Enter the amount in cents: 25\n    *   Coin Change:\n        *   Quarters: 1\n        *   Dimes: 0\n        *   Nickels: 0\n        *   Pennies: 0\n*   Enter the amount in cents: 10\n    *   Coin Change:\n        *   Quarters: 0\n        *   Dimes: 1\n        *   Nickels: 0\n        *   Pennies: 0\n\n### How It Works\n\n1.  The program defines a function `calculate_coin_change` that takes an amount in cents as input.\n2.  It initializes a dictionary `coin_change` to store the number of coins for each denomination (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).\n3.  The function iterates through the available coin denominations in descending order.\n4.  For each denomination, it calculates the number of coins required by performing integer division (`//`) of the remaining amount by the denomination.\n5.  The remaining amount is updated by taking the modulus (`%`) of the amount by the denomination.\n6.  The calculated coin change is stored in the `coin_change` dictionary.\n7.  The `main` function gets the amount from the user, calls `calculate_coin_change`, and prints the resulting coin change.\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to calculate the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount using conditional statements.",
