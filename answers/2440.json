  "answer": "Here's a Python program using the calendar module to display a calendar for a given month and year:\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef display_calendar(year, month):\n    # Create a calendar object\n    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Print the month and year\n    print(calendar.month_name[month], year)\n    print(\"Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\")\n\n    # Iterate over each week in the month\n    for week in cal:\n        # Iterate over each day in the week\n        for day in week:\n            # If the day is 0, it means it's not in the current month, so print a space\n            if day == 0:\n                print(\"  \", end=\" \")\n            # Otherwise, print the day\n            else:\n                print(f\"{day:2}\", end=\" \")\n        # Move to the next line after each week\n        print()\n\n# Test the function\nyear = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\nmonth = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\ndisplay_calendar(year, month)\n```\n\nThis program first creates a calendar object for the given month and year. Then it prints the month and year, followed by the days of the week. It then iterates over each week in the month, and for each week, it iterates over each day. If the day is 0, it means it's not in the current month, so it prints a space. Otherwise, it prints the day. Finally, it moves to the next line after each week.\n\nFor example, if you enter the year 2024 and the month 9, the program will display the calendar for September 2024.",
