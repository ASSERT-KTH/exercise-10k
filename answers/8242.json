  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade based on a predefined grading scale. The grading scale used is as follows:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    while score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the student's grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a student's score when prompted (e.g., 85).\n3. The program will display the student's grade based on the input score (e.g., B).\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple if/else statement structure to determine the student's grade.\n* The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n* The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, validates it, and calls the `calculate_grade` function to display the student's grade.\n* The program uses a while loop to ensure that the user enters a valid score between 0 and 100.",
