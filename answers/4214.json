  "answer": "**Generating Permutations of an Array**\n\n### Introduction\n\nGenerating all permutations of an array is a common problem in computer science. A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nWe will use a recursive approach to generate all permutations. The idea is to choose each element in the array as the first element, and then generate all permutations of the remaining elements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_permutations(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate all permutations of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if the array has only one element, return it\n    if len(arr) == 1:\n        return [arr]\n\n    permutations = []\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Choose the current element as the first element\n        first = arr[i]\n        # Generate all permutations of the remaining elements\n        remaining = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]\n        for p in generate_permutations(remaining):\n            # Add the first element to the beginning of each permutation\n            permutations.append([first] + p)\n\n    return permutations\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3]\npermutations = generate_permutations(arr)\nfor p in permutations:\n    print(p)\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 3, 2]\n[2, 1, 3]\n[2, 3, 1]\n[3, 1, 2]\n[3, 2, 1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_permutations` function takes an array as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input array.\n2. The base case is when the array has only one element, in which case we simply return it.\n3. For each element in the array, we choose it as the first element and generate all permutations of the remaining elements.\n4. We add the first element to the beginning of each permutation and add it to the list of permutations.\n5. Finally, we return the list of permutations.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n!), where n is the length of the input array. This is because there are n! permutations of an array of length n, and we generate each permutation exactly once.",
