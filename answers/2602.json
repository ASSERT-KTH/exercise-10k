  "answer": "Here is a Python program that accesses the value of a specific key in a dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef access_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Accesses the value of a specific key in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key (any): The key to access.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the key, or None if the key is not found.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to access the value of the key\n        value = dictionary[key]\n        return value\n    except KeyError:\n        # If the key is not found, return None\n        return None\n\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nkey_to_access = \"age\"\n\nvalue = access_dict_value(my_dict, key_to_access)\n\nif value is not None:\n    print(f\"The value of '{key_to_access}' is: {value}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The key '{key_to_access}' was not found in the dictionary.\")\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `access_dict_value` function takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `key`.\n2. It checks if the input `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary using `isinstance`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n3. It attempts to access the value of the `key` using `dictionary[key]`.\n4. If the `key` is found, it returns the associated value.\n5. If the `key` is not found, it catches the `KeyError` exception and returns `None`.\n6. In the example usage, we create a dictionary `my_dict` and specify a `key_to_access`.\n7. We call the `access_dict_value` function with `my_dict` and `key_to_access`, and print the result.",
