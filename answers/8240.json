  "answer": "**Weather Alert Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program uses if/else statements to send a weather alert based on the current weather conditions.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef send_weather_alert(temperature, precipitation, wind_speed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sends a weather alert based on the current weather conditions.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n        precipitation (float): The current precipitation in millimeters.\n        wind_speed (float): The current wind speed in kilometers per hour.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The weather alert message.\n    \"\"\"\n    alert_message = \"\"\n\n    if temperature < 0:\n        alert_message += \"Freezing temperatures warning: \"\n    elif temperature > 30:\n        alert_message += \"Heat wave warning: \"\n\n    if precipitation > 50:\n        if alert_message:\n            alert_message += \" Heavy precipitation warning. \"\n        else:\n            alert_message += \"Heavy precipitation warning: \"\n    elif precipitation > 10:\n        if alert_message:\n            alert_message += \" Precipitation warning. \"\n        else:\n            alert_message += \"Precipitation warning: \"\n\n    if wind_speed > 50:\n        if alert_message:\n            alert_message += \" Strong wind warning. \"\n        else:\n            alert_message += \"Strong wind warning: \"\n\n    if alert_message:\n        return f\"Weather Alert: {alert_message}\"\n    else:\n        return \"No weather alerts.\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    temperature = 25\n    precipitation = 20\n    wind_speed = 60\n\n    alert = send_weather_alert(temperature, precipitation, wind_speed)\n    print(alert)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `send_weather_alert` function takes three arguments: `temperature`, `precipitation`, and `wind_speed`.\n2. It uses if/else statements to check the current weather conditions and generates a weather alert message accordingly.\n3. If the temperature is below 0\u00b0C, it adds a \"Freezing temperatures warning\" to the alert message.\n4. If the temperature is above 30\u00b0C, it adds a \"Heat wave warning\" to the alert message.\n5. If the precipitation is above 50mm, it adds a \"Heavy precipitation warning\" to the alert message.\n6. If the precipitation is above 10mm, it adds a \"Precipitation warning\" to the alert message.\n7. If the wind speed is above 50km/h, it adds a \"Strong wind warning\" to the alert message.\n8. If no weather alerts are triggered, it returns a \"No weather alerts\" message.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Sending a weather alert to users based on their location and current weather conditions.\n* Integrating with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and generate alerts.\n* Using the program as a starting point for a more complex weather alert system with multiple conditions and alert levels.",
