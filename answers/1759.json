  "answer": "**Symmetric Difference of Two Lists**\n=====================================\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements that are in exactly one of the sets. Here's a Python program to find the symmetric difference of two lists of integers:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the symmetric difference of two lists.\n    \n    :param list1: The first list of integers.\n    :param list2: The second list of integers.\n    :return: A list of integers that are in exactly one of the input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert lists to sets for efficient set operations\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetric difference using set operations\n    symmetric_diff = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    \n    # Convert the result back to a list and return it\n    return list(symmetric_diff)\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(symmetric_difference(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We define a function `symmetric_difference` that takes two lists of integers as input.\n2.  We convert the input lists to sets using the `set` function. This allows us to perform efficient set operations.\n3.  We calculate the symmetric difference using the `symmetric_difference` method of the `set` class.\n4.  Finally, we convert the result back to a list using the `list` function and return it.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you prefer a more concise solution, you can use the `^` operator to calculate the symmetric difference:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) ^ set(list2))\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(symmetric_difference(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `^` operator to calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets, which is equivalent to the `symmetric_difference` method used in the previous example.",
