  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and outputs the perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the perimeter\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n    print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_perimeter` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.\n* The perimeter is calculated using the formula `2 * (length + width)`.\n* In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the length and width of the rectangle.\n* The `calculate_perimeter` function is then called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a length of 5 and a width of 3, the program will output `The perimeter of the rectangle is: 16.0`.\n* If the user enters a length of 10 and a width of 2, the program will output `The perimeter of the rectangle is: 24.0`.",
