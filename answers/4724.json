  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function should have a default argument for the name.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that prints a greeting message with a default name argument. This function will allow you to customize the greeting by passing a name, or it will use a default name if none is provided. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'greet' with a default argument 'name' set to 'World'.\ndef greet(name='World'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a greeting message with the provided name.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name to be used in the greeting. Defaults to 'World'.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use an f-string to format the greeting message with the provided name.\n    # This allows us to insert the value of 'name' directly into the string.\n    greeting_message = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Print the greeting message.\n    print(greeting_message)\n\n\n# Test the function by calling it without any arguments.\n# This should print 'Hello, World!' because 'World' is the default name.\ngreet()\n\n# Test the function by calling it with a custom name.\n# This should print 'Hello, Alice!' because we passed 'Alice' as the name.\ngreet('Alice')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `greet` function is defined with a default argument `name` set to `'World'`, which will be used if no name is provided when calling the function.\n* Inside the `greet` function, an f-string is used to format the `greeting_message` with the provided `name`, allowing for a dynamic and personalized greeting.\n* The `print` statement is then used to display the `greeting_message`.\n* The function is tested with and without a custom name to demonstrate its functionality.",
