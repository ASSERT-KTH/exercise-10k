  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a target value as input, and returns the index of the target value in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef Search(arr, target):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 4\nprint(Search(arr, target))  # Output: 3\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 10\nprint(Search(arr, target))  # Output: -1\n```\nThis code defines the `Search` function, which iterates through the input array `arr` and checks if each element is equal to the `target` value. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the match. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`. The code also includes example usage with two test cases.",
