  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the operation and prints the result. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, print an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Gets user input and performs the calculation.\"\"\"\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): \")\n\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a `calculate` function that takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the operation, and returns the result. It also defines a `main` function that gets user input, calls `calculate`, and prints the result. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, or if the operation is not supported, it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message. \n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `addition` as the operation. The program will print `The result of addition is 15.0`.\n* Run the program and enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `division` as the operation. The program will print `Error: Cannot divide by zero`.\n* Run the program and enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `foo` as the operation. The program will print `Error: Unsupported operation`.",
