  "answer": "Edit Distance Calculation\n=========================\n\nThe edit distance between two strings can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Initialize the first row and column of the matrix with incremental values, representing the edit distance for empty strings.\n3. Fill in the rest of the matrix by comparing characters from the input strings and calculating the minimum edit distance.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef edit_distance(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the edit distance between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of operations needed to transform str1 into str2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the matrix with zeros\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(str2) + 1)] for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the first row and column\n    for i in range(len(str1) + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(len(str2) + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the matrix\n    for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):\n            # Check if the current characters match\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                # If they match, no operation is needed\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                # If they don't match, consider insertion, deletion, and substitution\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])\n\n    # The edit distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix\n    return dp[len(str1)][len(str2)]\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"kitten\"\nstr2 = \"sitting\"\nprint(\"Edit distance:\", edit_distance(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe provided code calculates the edit distance between two input strings using dynamic programming. It initializes a 2D matrix `dp` to store the edit distances between substrings of the input strings. The first row and column are initialized with incremental values, representing the edit distance for empty strings. The rest of the matrix is filled in by comparing characters from the input strings and calculating the minimum edit distance. If the current characters match, no operation is needed, and the edit distance is copied from the top-left diagonal cell. If the characters don't match, the code considers insertion, deletion, and substitution operations and chooses the one with the minimum edit distance. Finally, the edit distance is returned as the value stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings. This is because the code iterates over each character in both strings to fill in the matrix.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(n \\* m), which is the size of the 2D matrix used to store the edit distances.",
