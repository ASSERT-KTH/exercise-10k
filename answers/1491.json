  "answer": "**Set Operations in Programming**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of set operations in programming using Python. Set operations are used to manipulate sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.\n\n**Program Code**\n```python\n# Define two sets\nset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nset2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n# Print the sets\nprint(\"Set 1:\", set1)\nprint(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n\n# Union operation (combines all elements from both sets)\nprint(\"\\nUnion:\")\nprint(set1.union(set2))\nprint(set1 | set2)\n\n# Intersection operation (returns elements common to both sets)\nprint(\"\\nIntersection:\")\nprint(set1.intersection(set2))\nprint(set1 & set2)\n\n# Difference operation (returns elements in set1 but not in set2)\nprint(\"\\nDifference (set1 - set2):\")\nprint(set1.difference(set2))\nprint(set1 - set2)\n\n# Difference operation (returns elements in set2 but not in set1)\nprint(\"\\nDifference (set2 - set1):\")\nprint(set2.difference(set1))\nprint(set2 - set1)\n\n# Symmetric difference operation (returns elements in either set, but not both)\nprint(\"\\nSymmetric Difference:\")\nprint(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))\nprint(set1 ^ set2)\n\n# Subset operation (checks if all elements of set1 are in set2)\nprint(\"\\nSubset (set1 is subset of set2):\")\nprint(set1.issubset(set2))\n\n# Superset operation (checks if all elements of set2 are in set1)\nprint(\"\\nSuperset (set1 is superset of set2):\")\nprint(set1.issuperset(set2))\n```\n\n**Example Output**\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nUnion:\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nIntersection:\n{4, 5}\n{4, 5}\n\nDifference (set1 - set2):\n{1, 2, 3}\n{1, 2, 3}\n\nDifference (set2 - set1):\n{6, 7, 8}\n{6, 7, 8}\n\nSymmetric Difference:\n{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSubset (set1 is subset of set2):\nFalse\n\nSuperset (set1 is superset of set2):\nFalse\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program defines two sets, `set1` and `set2`, and demonstrates the following set operations:\n\n*   **Union**: Combines all elements from both sets using the `union()` method or the `|` operator.\n*   **Intersection**: Returns elements common to both sets using the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator.\n*   **Difference**: Returns elements in one set but not in the other using the `difference()` method or the `-` operator.\n*   **Symmetric Difference**: Returns elements in either set, but not both, using the `symmetric_difference()` method or the `^` operator.\n*   **Subset**: Checks if all elements of one set are in another set using the `issubset()` method.\n*   **Superset**: Checks if all elements of one set are in another set using the `issuperset()` method.\n\nThese set operations are useful in various programming scenarios, such as data analysis, filtering, and manipulation.",
