  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0.\n3. The GCD is then returned as the absolute value of `a`.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the GCD is calculated and printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 12 and 18:\n\t+ Input: `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 18`\n\t+ Output: `The GCD of 12 and 18 is 6`\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30:\n\t+ Input: `num1 = 24`, `num2 = 30`\n\t+ Output: `The GCD of 24 and 30 is 6`\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it suitable for large inputs.",
