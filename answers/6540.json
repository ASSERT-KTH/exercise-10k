  "answer": "### Leaderboard Function\n#### Description\nThis function generates a leaderboard for a given game. It takes in a dictionary of player scores and returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains the player's name and their score.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef generate_leaderboard(player_scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a leaderboard for a given game.\n\n    Args:\n        player_scores (dict): A dictionary where the keys are player names and the values are their scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains the player's name and their score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the player scores in descending order\n    sorted_scores = sorted(player_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    return sorted_scores\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    # Define the player scores\n    player_scores = {\n        \"John\": 100,\n        \"Alice\": 200,\n        \"Bob\": 50,\n        \"Charlie\": 150\n    }\n\n    # Generate the leaderboard\n    leaderboard = generate_leaderboard(player_scores)\n\n    # Print the leaderboard\n    print(\"Leaderboard:\")\n    for i, (player, score) in enumerate(leaderboard):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {player}: {score}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `generate_leaderboard` function takes in a dictionary of player scores.\n2. It sorts the player scores in descending order using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key.\n3. The sorted list of tuples is then returned.\n4. In the `main` function, we define an example dictionary of player scores and generate the leaderboard using the `generate_leaderboard` function.\n5. Finally, we print the leaderboard, with each player's rank, name, and score.",
