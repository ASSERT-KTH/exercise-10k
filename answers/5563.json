  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n\nHere is a Python program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it, providing hints if the guess is too high or too low.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n* Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n* Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. The program enters a loop where it asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program reveals the correct answer and ends.\n4. The program tries to convert the user's guess to an integer using `int(user_guess)`.\n5. If the user's guess is not a valid integer, the program prints an error message and asks for another guess.\n6. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends.\n7. If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program prints a hint and asks for another guess.\n8. The program keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it when the user finds the correct answer.",
