  "answer": "Quadratic Equation Solver\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes the coefficients of a quadratic equation as input and returns the solutions.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_quadratic(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The coefficient of the squared term.\n        b (float): The coefficient of the linear term.\n        c (float): The constant term.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The solutions to the quadratic equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    d = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n    # Check if the discriminant is positive, negative, or zero\n    if d > 0:\n        # Two distinct real solutions\n        solution1 = (-b + math.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        solution2 = (-b - math.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        return solution1, solution2\n    elif d == 0:\n        # One repeated real solution\n        solution = -b / (2*a)\n        return solution, solution\n    else:\n        # Two complex solutions\n        solution1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        solution2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        return solution1, solution2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coefficients from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the coefficient of the squared term (a): \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the coefficient of the linear term (b): \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the constant term (c): \"))\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation\n    solution1, solution2 = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)\n\n    # Print the solutions\n    if solution1 == solution2:\n        print(f\"The solution is x = {solution1}\")\n    elif solution1.imag == 0 and solution2.imag == 0:\n        print(f\"The solutions are x = {solution1} and x = {solution2}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The solutions are x = {solution1} and x = {solution2}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0:\n    *   Input: a = 1, b = 5, c = 6\n    *   Output: The solutions are x = -2.0 and x = -3.0\n*   Solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0:\n    *   Input: a = 1, b = 4, c = 4\n    *   Output: The solution is x = -2.0\n*   Solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x + 2 = 0:\n    *   Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 2\n    *   Output: The solutions are x = (-2+1.4142135623730951j) and x = (-2-1.4142135623730951j)\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to handle the case where the discriminant is zero, as this will result in a repeated real solution.\n*   Use the `cmath` module to handle complex solutions.\n*   Consider adding error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid coefficients.",
