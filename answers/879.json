  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a coffee shop. The program should take in the order and output the updated order based on the following conditions: if the user orders a coffee, add the coffee to the order, if the user orders a pastry, add the pastry to the order, if the user checks the order, output the current order.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution using a class to simulate a coffee shop:\n\n```python\nclass CoffeeShop:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.order = []\n\n    def add_coffee(self, coffee_type):\n        \"\"\"Add a coffee to the order.\"\"\"\n        self.order.append(f\"Coffee: {coffee_type}\")\n\n    def add_pastry(self, pastry_type):\n        \"\"\"Add a pastry to the order.\"\"\"\n        self.order.append(f\"Pastry: {pastry_type}\")\n\n    def check_order(self):\n        \"\"\"Output the current order.\"\"\"\n        if not self.order:\n            print(\"Your order is empty.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your current order is:\")\n            for i, item in enumerate(self.order, start=1):\n                print(f\"{i}. {item}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    coffee_shop = CoffeeShop()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nCoffee Shop Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Order a coffee\")\n        print(\"2. Order a pastry\")\n        print(\"3. Check your order\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            coffee_type = input(\"Enter the type of coffee (e.g., latte, cappuccino, espresso): \")\n            coffee_shop.add_coffee(coffee_type)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            pastry_type = input(\"Enter the type of pastry (e.g., croissant, muffin, cake): \")\n            coffee_shop.add_pastry(pastry_type)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            coffee_shop.check_order()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Thank you for visiting our coffee shop!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. We define a `CoffeeShop` class to encapsulate the coffee shop's functionality.\n2. The `__init__` method initializes the coffee shop with an empty order.\n3. The `add_coffee` and `add_pastry` methods allow customers to add coffee and pastry items to their order, respectively.\n4. The `check_order` method displays the current order.\n5. In the `main` function, we create a `CoffeeShop` instance and present the customer with a menu to interact with the coffee shop.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Order a coffee: Choose option 1, enter the type of coffee (e.g., latte).\n* Order a pastry: Choose option 2, enter the type of pastry (e.g., croissant).\n* Check your order: Choose option 3 to view your current order.\n* Exit the program: Choose option 4 to exit the coffee shop simulation.",
