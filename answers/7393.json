  "prompt": "Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop, where n is given as input by the user.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specification you provided:\n```\n# Get the input from the user\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    print(i)\n```\nThis code does exactly what the specification describes: it prompts the user for a number, converts the input to an integer using `int()`, and then uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using `range(1, n+1)`.",
