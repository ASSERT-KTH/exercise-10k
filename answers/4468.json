  "answer": "**Element Occurrence Counter**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(lst, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for element in lst:\n        if element == target:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\n    target = 2\n    occurrences = count_occurrences(lst, target)\n    print(f\"The element {target} occurs {occurrences} times in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `count_occurrences` that takes a list `lst` and a target element `target` as arguments.\n2. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.\n3. Iterate over each element in the list using a for loop.\n4. Check if the current element is equal to the target element. If it is, increment the counter by 1.\n5. After the loop finishes, return the count.\n6. In the `main` function, demonstrate the usage of `count_occurrences` with an example list and target element.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe element 2 occurs 4 times in the list.\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it checks each element once.\n* The `count_occurrences` function is reusable and can be applied to any list and target element.",
