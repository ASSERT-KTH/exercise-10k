  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Solution**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a list of strings, find the longest common prefix.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Check for empty list**: If the input list is empty, return an empty string.\n2. **Find the shortest string**: Identify the shortest string in the list, as the longest common prefix cannot be longer than this string.\n3. **Iterate through characters**: Iterate through each character in the shortest string.\n4. **Compare characters**: For each character, compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.\n5. **Return prefix**: If a mismatch is found, return the prefix up to the mismatched character. If no mismatch is found, return the entire shortest string.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used to store the shortest string and the prefix.",
