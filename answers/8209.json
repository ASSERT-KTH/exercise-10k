  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game in Python**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program scrambles a list of words and asks the user to unscramble them. The game continues until the user decides to quit.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to scramble\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a word by shuffling its characters\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!\")\n    print(\"Unscramble the words to win. Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n\n    while True:\n        word = random.choice(words)\n        scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n        print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n\n        answer = input(\"Your answer: \")\n\n        if answer.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        elif answer.lower() == word:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a scrambled word and ask for your answer.\n3. Type your answer, and the program will tell you if it's correct or not.\n4. To exit the game, type \"quit\".\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `scramble_word` function shuffles the characters of a word using the `random.shuffle` function.\n* The `main` function runs the game loop, selecting a random word from the list, scrambling it, and asking the user for their answer.\n* The game continues until the user types \"quit\".",
