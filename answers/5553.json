  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the first 20 numbers in the Pell sequence using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the first 20 numbers in the Pell sequence using a while loop:\n```\n# Initialize the first two numbers in the Pell sequence\na, b = 0, 1\n\n# Print the first two numbers\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\n\n# Initialize a counter\ni = 2\n\n# Print the next 18 numbers in the sequence\nwhile i < 20:\n    # Calculate the next number in the sequence\n    a, b = b, 2 * b + a\n    # Print the next number\n    print(b)\n    # Increment the counter\n    i += 1\n```\nThis program initializes the first two numbers in the Pell sequence (`a` and `b`) to 0 and 1, respectively. It then prints these two numbers and enters a loop that calculates and prints the next 18 numbers in the sequence. The loop uses a counter `i` to keep track of the number of iterations.\n\nIn each iteration, the program calculates the next number in the sequence using the recurrence relation `b = 2 * b + a`, and then updates `a` and `b` to the new values. The program then prints the new value of `b` and increments the counter `i`.\n\nWhen the loop finishes, the program has printed the first 20 numbers in the Pell sequence.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more concise version:\n```\na, b = 0, 1\ni = 0\nwhile i < 20:\n    print(a)\n    a, b = b, 2 * b + a\n    i += 1\n```\nThis version eliminates the need to print the first two numbers separately and uses a single loop to print all 20 numbers in the sequence.",
