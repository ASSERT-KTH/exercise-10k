  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns its equivalent in Fahrenheit.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    celsius (float): Temperature in Celsius.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: Temperature in Fahrenheit.\n    \"\"\"\n    if celsius < -273.15:\n        raise ValueError(\"Temperature cannot be lower than absolute zero.\")\n    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32\n    return fahrenheit\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        celsius = float(input(\"Enter temperature in Celsius: \"))\n        fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)\n        print(f\"{celsius}\u00b0C is equal to {fahrenheit}\u00b0F\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that takes a temperature in Celsius as input, checks if it's lower than absolute zero (-273.15\u00b0C), and then calculates its equivalent in Fahrenheit using the formula `(\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = \u00b0F`. The result is then returned by the function.\n\nIn the `main` function, the program asks the user to input a temperature in Celsius, attempts to convert it to a float, calls the `celsius_to_fahrenheit` function, and then prints the result. If the input temperature is lower than absolute zero, a `ValueError` is raised and caught by the `except` block, which then prints the error message.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `temperature_converter.py`) and run it from the command line using `python temperature_converter.py`. Then, simply follow the prompt to enter a temperature in Celsius.",
