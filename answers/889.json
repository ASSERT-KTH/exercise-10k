  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program asks the user for a number in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... and prints out the next number in the sequence.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_next_number_in_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the next number in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The current number in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * 2\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for a number in the sequence\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Enter a number in the sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...): \"))\n            if num <= 0 or (num & (num - 1) != 0):\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive power of 2.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n    # Print the next number in the sequence\n    next_num = get_next_number_in_sequence(num)\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a number in the sequence. For example:\n```\nEnter a number in the sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...): 8\nThe next number in the sequence is: 16\n```\n\n### How it Works\nThe program uses a simple function `get_next_number_in_sequence` to calculate the next number in the sequence by multiplying the current number by 2. The `main` function asks the user for a number in the sequence, checks if it's a valid positive power of 2, and then prints the next number in the sequence.",
