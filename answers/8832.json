  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should use two separate functions, one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The length and width of the rectangle should be provided as input to the program.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define functions\ndef area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\ndef perimeter(length, width):\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Main program\nprint(\"Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator\")\nprint(\"----------------------------------------\")\n\n# Get input from user\nlength = int(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = int(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n# Calculate and display area and perimeter\nprint(\"Area:\", area(length, width))\nprint(\"Perimeter:\", perimeter(length, width))\n```\nThis code matches the specification provided, including the two functions `area()` and `perimeter()`, the main program, and the input/output operations. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
