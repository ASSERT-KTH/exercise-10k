  "answer": "**Miles Per Hour Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the miles per hour (mph) of a car given the distance traveled and the time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mph(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate miles per hour (mph) given distance and time.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled in miles.\n        time (float): Time taken in hours.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Miles per hour (mph).\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    return distance / time\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Miles Per Hour Calculator\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            distance = float(input(\"Enter distance traveled (miles): \"))\n            time = float(input(\"Enter time taken (hours): \"))\n\n            mph = calculate_mph(distance, time)\n            print(f\"Miles per hour: {mph:.2f} mph\")\n\n            cont = input(\"Do you want to calculate again? (y/n): \")\n            if cont.lower() != 'y':\n                break\n        except ValueError as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance traveled in miles when prompted.\n3. Enter the time taken in hours when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the miles per hour.\n5. You will be asked if you want to calculate again. Enter 'y' to continue or 'n' to exit.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n* The `calculate_mph` function calculates the miles per hour given the distance and time.\n* The program handles invalid input (e.g., zero time) by raising a `ValueError`.\n* The result is displayed with two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
