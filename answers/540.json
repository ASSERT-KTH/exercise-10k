  "answer": "**ZigZag Conversion Function**\n================================\n\nThe function `zigzag_conversion` takes a string `s` and an integer `num_rows` as input, and returns the string read off in row order.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef zigzag_conversion(s: str, num_rows: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a string into a zigzag pattern and reads off the characters in row order.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n    num_rows (int): The number of rows in the zigzag pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The string read off in row order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_rows == 1 or num_rows >= len(s):\n        return s\n\n    # Initialize a list of strings, each representing a row in the zigzag pattern\n    rows = [''] * num_rows\n\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the current row and direction\n    row, step = 0, 1\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Append the character to the current row\n        rows[row] += char\n\n        # If we are at the first or last row, change the direction\n        if row == 0:\n            step = 1\n        elif row == num_rows - 1:\n            step = -1\n\n        # Move to the next row\n        row += step\n\n    # Join the rows together to form the final string\n    return ''.join(rows)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\"\n    num_rows = 3\n    print(zigzag_conversion(s, num_rows))  # Output: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  If `num_rows` is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string `s`, return `s` immediately, as there is no need to perform any zigzag conversion.\n2.  Initialize a list `rows` of `num_rows` empty strings, where each string represents a row in the zigzag pattern.\n3.  Initialize variables `row` and `step` to keep track of the current row and direction (either 1 for going down or -1 for going up).\n4.  Iterate over each character in the input string `s`.\n5.  For each character, append it to the current row (`rows[row]`) and update the row and direction as necessary.\n6.  After iterating over all characters, join the rows together to form the final string, which is the input string read off in row order.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, as we are iterating over each character in the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), as we are storing each character in the input string in the `rows` list.",
