  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that prompts the user for their name and returns it, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'get_user_name' that will prompt the user for their name and return it.\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prompts the user for their name and returns it.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The user's name.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use the built-in 'input' function in Python to prompt the user for their name.\n    # The string 'Please enter your name: ' is used as a prompt to inform the user what to do.\n    user_name = input('Please enter your name: ')\n\n    # Return the user's name.\n    # This will make the name available to the part of the program that called this function.\n    return user_name\n\n# Call the function and store the result in a variable.\n# This is an example of how you might use this function in a larger program.\nuser_name = get_user_name()\n\n# Print the user's name to the console.\n# This is just an example of what you might do with the user's name after you've got it.\nprint('Hello, ' + user_name + '!')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_name` function is defined with a clear docstring that explains its purpose and return value. This function utilizes the built-in `input` function in Python to prompt the user for their name.\n* The `input` function is used with a prompt string 'Please enter your name: ' to inform the user what to do, and the user's input is stored in the `user_name` variable.\n* The function then returns the `user_name`, making it available to the part of the program that called this function.\n* Finally, the function is called, and the returned user name is printed to the console with a greeting message.",
