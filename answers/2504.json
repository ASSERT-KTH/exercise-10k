  "answer": "Here is a simple program that takes two numbers as input and returns their division result. This program is written in Python.\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division result.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The dividend.\n        num2 (float): The divisor.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The division result.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n        result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"The division result is: {result}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n- The program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their division result.\n- The function checks if the divisor is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if it is.\n- The `main` function asks the user to input two numbers, calls `divide_numbers` with these numbers, and prints the result.\n- The program also includes error handling to catch and display any errors that may occur during execution.\n\n### Example use case\n- Run the program and enter two numbers when prompted, for example, `10` and `2`.\n- The program will output the division result, which in this case would be `5.0`.\n- If you enter `0` as the second number, the program will display an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.",
