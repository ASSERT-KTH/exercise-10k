  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\" to help the user narrow down the range.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I was thinking of number {}. Thanks for playing!\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will provide feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\".\n4. The user can continue guessing until they correctly guess the number.\n5. If the user wants to quit, they can type \"quit\" at any time.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `random` module to generate a random number.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or quit.\n* The program uses a `try`-`except` block to handle the case where the user enters something that is not a valid number.",
