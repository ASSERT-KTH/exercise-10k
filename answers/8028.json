  "answer": "**Calculator Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes in two numbers and an operation from the user, performs the specified operation, and prints out the result.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for two numbers and an operation, performs the operation, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        # Handle division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n            return\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation.\")\n        return\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    # Ask the user if they want to perform another operation\n    while True:\n        response = input(\"Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): \")\n        if response.lower() == \"yes\":\n            calculator()\n        elif response.lower() == \"no\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid response. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Add two numbers: Enter `10` and `5` as the numbers, and `+` as the operation.\n*   Subtract two numbers: Enter `10` and `5` as the numbers, and `-` as the operation.\n*   Multiply two numbers: Enter `10` and `5` as the numbers, and `*` as the operation.\n*   Divide two numbers: Enter `10` and `2` as the numbers, and `/` as the operation.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the numbers and operation.",
