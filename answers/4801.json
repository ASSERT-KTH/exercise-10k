  "prompt": "Implement a binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array. The function should take in a sorted array and a target value as input and return the index of the target value if it exists in the array, otherwise return -1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the binary search algorithm as per the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if nums[mid] == target:\n                return mid\n            elif nums[mid] < target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return -1\n```\nI've implemented the code exactly as described in the specification, with attention to all the details. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
