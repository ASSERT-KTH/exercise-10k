  "answer": "Here is a Python implementation of the Radix Sort algorithm using a for loop:\n```python\n# Radix Sort Algorithm Implementation\n\ndef radix_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers using the Radix Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the maximum number to determine the number of digits\n    max_num = max(arr)\n\n    # Initialize the exponent to 1 (for the least significant digit)\n    exp = 1\n\n    # Loop through each digit position\n    while max_num // exp > 0:\n        # Initialize the buckets for each digit value (0-9)\n        buckets = [[] for _ in range(10)]\n\n        # Distribute the numbers into the buckets based on the current digit\n        for num in arr:\n            # Calculate the digit value at the current exponent\n            digit = (num // exp) % 10\n            # Add the number to the corresponding bucket\n            buckets[digit].append(num)\n\n        # Collect the numbers from the buckets back into the array\n        arr = []\n        for bucket in buckets:\n            arr.extend(bucket)\n\n        # Move to the next digit position\n        exp *= 10\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\nsorted_numbers = radix_sort(numbers)\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\nThis code implements the Radix Sort algorithm using a for loop to iterate through each digit position and distribute the numbers into buckets based on the current digit. The `radix_sort` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list.\n\n**How the code works:**\n\n1. Find the maximum number in the input list to determine the number of digits.\n2. Initialize the exponent to 1 (for the least significant digit).\n3. Loop through each digit position using a while loop.\n4. For each digit position, initialize 10 buckets (one for each digit value 0-9).\n5. Distribute the numbers into the buckets based on the current digit using a for loop.\n6. Collect the numbers from the buckets back into the array using a for loop.\n7. Move to the next digit position by multiplying the exponent by 10.\n8. Repeat steps 3-7 until all digit positions have been processed.\n\n**Example output:**\n```\nOriginal list: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\nSorted list: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]\n```\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(nk), where n is the number of elements in the input list and k is the number of digits in the maximum number.",
