  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the total price of a meal given the prices of individual items.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the total price of a meal given the prices of individual items.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the total price of a meal\ndef calculate_total_price():\n    # Initialize the total price to 0\n    total_price = 0\n    \n    # Get the number of items in the meal\n    num_items = int(input(\"Enter the number of items in the meal: \"))\n    \n    # Get the price of each item and add it to the total price\n    for i in range(num_items):\n        item_name = input(f\"Enter the name of item {i+1}: \")\n        item_price = float(input(f\"Enter the price of {item_name}: $\"))\n        total_price += item_price\n    \n    # Calculate the tax (8% in this example)\n    tax_rate = 0.08\n    tax = total_price * tax_rate\n    \n    # Calculate the total price including tax\n    total_price_with_tax = total_price + tax\n    \n    # Print the total price and the total price including tax\n    print(f\"\\nTotal price: ${total_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax ({tax_rate*100}%): ${tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total price including tax: ${total_price_with_tax:.2f}\")\n\n# Call the function to calculate the total price\ncalculate_total_price()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the number of items in the meal. For each item, you'll be asked to enter the name and price of the item. After entering all the items, the program will calculate and display the total price, tax, and the total price including tax.\n\nFor example, if you enter the following items:\n\n* Item 1: Burger ($10.00)\n* Item 2: Fries ($3.00)\n* Item 3: Drink ($2.00)\n\nThe program will calculate the total price as $15.00, the tax as $1.20 (8% of $15.00), and the total price including tax as $16.20.",
