  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if two strings are anagrams using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # Remove any white spaces and convert to lower case\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters\n    char_freq = {}\n\n    # Count the frequency of characters in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Subtract the frequency of characters in the second string\n    for char in str2:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] -= 1\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    # Check if all frequencies are zero\n    for freq in char_freq.values():\n        if freq != 0:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n\n# Test the function\nstr1 = \"Listen\"\nstr2 = \"Silent\"\nprint(are_anagrams(str1, str2))  # Output: True\n\nstr1 = \"Hello\"\nstr2 = \"World\"\nprint(are_anagrams(str1, str2))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis program works by first removing any white spaces and converting both strings to lower case. It then checks if both strings have the same length. If they don't, it immediately returns `False`.\n\nNext, it creates a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in the first string. It then subtracts the frequency of characters in the second string. If any character in the second string is not found in the dictionary, it immediately returns `False`.\n\nFinally, it checks if all frequencies in the dictionary are zero. If any frequency is not zero, it returns `False`. If all frequencies are zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the two strings are anagrams.\n\nNote: This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because it makes three passes through the strings: one to count the frequency of characters in the first string, one to subtract the frequency of characters in the second string, and one to check if all frequencies are zero.",
