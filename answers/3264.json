  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        if not guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Convert the input to an integer\n        guess = int(guess)\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the attempt counter\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\n    # Print a success message\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n- It enters a while loop, which continues until the user guesses the number correctly.\n- Inside the loop, the program asks the user for their guess using `input()`.\n- It checks if the input is a valid integer and if it's within the correct range (1-100).\n- If the guess is not valid, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n- If the guess is valid but not correct, it prints a hint (\"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\") and increments the attempt counter.\n- Once the user guesses the number correctly, it prints a success message with the number of attempts taken.\n\n### Example Use Case\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 100. You can enter your guess, and it will tell you if it's too high or too low. Keep guessing until you find the correct number. The program will then congratulate you and tell you how many attempts it took to guess the number correctly.",
