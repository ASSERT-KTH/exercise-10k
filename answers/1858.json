  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of lists of integers as input, and returns a new list of lists containing the same elements, but with the rows and columns transposed.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that satisfies the given specification:\n```\ndef transpose(lists):\n    if not lists:  # check if the input list is empty\n        return []\n    return list(map(list, zip(*lists)))\n\n# Test the function\nprint(transpose([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))\n```\nThis code defines the `transpose` function as specified, which takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists with the rows and columns transposed. The function uses the `zip(*lists)` expression to transpose the input list, and the `map` function to convert the resulting tuples back into lists. Finally, it converts the resulting iterator back into a list using the `list` function. The test case at the end demonstrates the function's behavior on a sample input.",
