  "answer": "**Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program plays a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the user. The user plays as 'X' and the computer plays as 'O'. The game continues until either the user or the computer wins, or until the game is a draw.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Prints the current state of the board\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the game has been won\"\"\"\n    winning_combinations = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combination in winning_combinations:\n        if board[combination[0]] == board[combination[1]] == board[combination[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combination[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Makes a random move for the computer\"\"\"\n    possible_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    move = random.choice(possible_moves)\n    board[move] = \"O\"\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move(board)\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The current state of the board will be printed.\n3. Enter your move by typing a number from 1 to 9, where 1 corresponds to the top-left space and 9 corresponds to the bottom-right space.\n4. The computer will make a random move after your turn.\n5. The game continues until either you or the computer wins, or until the game is a draw.\n\nNote: This is a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe and the computer's moves are random. For a more challenging game, you could implement a more sophisticated AI algorithm, such as the Minimax algorithm.",
