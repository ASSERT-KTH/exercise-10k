  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a triangle pattern of asterisks (*).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_triangle(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a triangle pattern of asterisks (*).\n\n    Args:\n        height (int): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, height + 1):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for _ in range(height - i):\n            print(\" \", end=\" \")\n        # Print asterisks\n        for _ in range(2 * i - 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nprint_triangle(5)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program with an argument of `5`, it will print the following triangle pattern:\n```\n        * \n      * * * \n    * * * * * \n  * * * * * * * \n* * * * * * * * * \n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`for i in range(1, height + 1)`) controls the rows of the triangle. It runs from `1` to `height`.\n2. **Inner Loop 1**: The first inner loop (`for _ in range(height - i)`) prints the leading spaces for each row. The number of spaces decreases by one for each row.\n3. **Inner Loop 2**: The second inner loop (`for _ in range(2 * i - 1)`) prints the asterisks for each row. The number of asterisks increases by two for each row.\n4. **Print Statement**: After the inner loops, a `print()` statement is used to move to the next line.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nTo create this program, follow these steps:\n* Define a function `print_triangle(height)` that takes an integer `height` as an argument.\n* Implement the outer loop to control the rows of the triangle.\n* Add the first inner loop to print the leading spaces for each row.\n* Add the second inner loop to print the asterisks for each row.\n* Use a `print()` statement to move to the next line after each row.\n* Call the `print_triangle(height)` function with the desired height to print the triangle pattern.",
