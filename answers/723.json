  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division result and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs the task:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate division result and remainder\ndef calculate_division_result_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    # Check if divisor is not zero\n    if divisor == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n    else:\n        # Calculate division result and remainder\n        division_result = dividend // divisor\n        remainder = dividend % divisor\n        return division_result, remainder\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Take input from user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Calculate division result and remainder\n    result = calculate_division_result_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n    # Check if result is an error message\n    if isinstance(result, str):\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        division_result, remainder = result\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {division_result} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program defines a function `calculate_division_result_and_remainder` that takes two numbers (`dividend` and `divisor`) as input and returns their division result and remainder.\n*   Inside the function, it checks if the `divisor` is zero to prevent division by zero errors. If the `divisor` is zero, it returns an error message.\n*   If the `divisor` is not zero, it calculates the division result using the `//` operator and the remainder using the `%` operator.\n*   The `main` function takes input from the user, calls the `calculate_division_result_and_remainder` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the dividend and divisor. For example:\n\n*   Enter the dividend: 17\n*   Enter the divisor: 5\n\nThe program will output:\n\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2.",
