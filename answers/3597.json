  "answer": "**Change Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the change given the amount paid and the total bill.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(total_bill, amount_paid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the change given the total bill and the amount paid.\n\n    Args:\n        total_bill (float): The total bill amount.\n        amount_paid (float): The amount paid by the customer.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The change amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if amount_paid < total_bill:\n        raise ValueError(\"Amount paid cannot be less than the total bill\")\n    change = amount_paid - total_bill\n    return change\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the total bill and amount paid from the user\n    total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill: $\"))\n    amount_paid = float(input(\"Enter the amount paid: $\"))\n\n    # Calculate the change\n    try:\n        change = calculate_change(total_bill, amount_paid)\n        print(f\"Change: ${change:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the total bill when prompted (e.g., `100.00`).\n3. Enter the amount paid when prompted (e.g., `120.00`).\n4. The program will display the change amount (e.g., `Change: $20.00`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple `calculate_change` function to calculate the change.\n* The `main` function gets the total bill and amount paid from the user and calls the `calculate_change` function.\n* The program handles cases where the amount paid is less than the total bill by raising a `ValueError`.\n* The change amount is displayed with two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
