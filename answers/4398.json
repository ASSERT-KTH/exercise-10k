  "answer": "### Set Operations Using Variables\n#### Overview\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how to perform basic set operations using variables in Python. Set operations include union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define two sets\nset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nset2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n# Union of two sets\nunion_set = set1.union(set2)\nprint(\"Union of set1 and set2: \", union_set)\n\n# Intersection of two sets\nintersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)\nprint(\"Intersection of set1 and set2: \", intersection_set)\n\n# Difference of two sets\ndifference_set = set1.difference(set2)\nprint(\"Difference of set1 and set2: \", difference_set)\n\n# Symmetric difference of two sets\nsymmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\nprint(\"Symmetric difference of set1 and set2: \", symmetric_difference_set)\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the following operators:\n# Union: |\n# Intersection: &\n# Difference: -\n# Symmetric difference: ^\nprint(\"Union of set1 and set2: \", set1 | set2)\nprint(\"Intersection of set1 and set2: \", set1 & set2)\nprint(\"Difference of set1 and set2: \", set1 - set2)\nprint(\"Symmetric difference of set1 and set2: \", set1 ^ set2)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Union**: The union of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in either set.\n2. **Intersection**: The intersection of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in both sets.\n3. **Difference**: The difference of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.\n4. **Symmetric Difference**: The symmetric difference of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in either set, but not in both.\n\nThe code above demonstrates how to perform these set operations using variables and the corresponding methods or operators.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose you have two lists of students: one list of students who are enrolled in a math class and another list of students who are enrolled in a science class. You can use set operations to find the students who are enrolled in both classes, the students who are enrolled in only one of the classes, or the students who are enrolled in either class.\n\n```python\nmath_students = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"}\nscience_students = {\"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Eve\", \"Frank\"}\n\n# Find the students who are enrolled in both classes\nboth_classes = math_students.intersection(science_students)\nprint(\"Students enrolled in both classes: \", both_classes)\n\n# Find the students who are enrolled in only the math class\nonly_math = math_students.difference(science_students)\nprint(\"Students enrolled in only the math class: \", only_math)\n\n# Find the students who are enrolled in either class\neither_class = math_students.union(science_students)\nprint(\"Students enrolled in either class: \", either_class)\n```",
