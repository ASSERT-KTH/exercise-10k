  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a variable and its value as input, and then determines the data type of the variable. The variable can be an integer, float, string, or boolean. The program should output the data type of the variable.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef typeof(var):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the data type of a variable.\n\n    Args:\n        var: The variable to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        The data type of the variable as a string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(var, bool):\n        return \"boolean\"\n    elif isinstance(var, int):\n        return \"integer\"\n    elif isinstance(var, str):\n        return \"string\"\n    elif isinstance(var, float):\n        return \"float\"\n    else:\n        return \"unknown\"\n\nx = 5\nprint(typeof(x))  # Output: \"integer\"\n```\nNote that I've used the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the variable, as it is the most Pythonic way to do so. I've also used the `bool`, `int`, `str`, and `float` types to check for the respective data types, as they are the built-in types in Python. The function returns the data type as a string, using the names \"boolean\", \"integer\", \"string\", and \"float\" as specified.",
