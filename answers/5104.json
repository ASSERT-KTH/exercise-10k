  "answer": "Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n### Boolean Operations\n\nWe'll define three functions to perform the basic Boolean operations: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.\n\n```python\ndef boolean_and(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a logical AND operation on two Boolean variables.\n    \n    Args:\n    a (bool): The first Boolean variable.\n    b (bool): The second Boolean variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: The result of the AND operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a and b\n\ndef boolean_or(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a logical OR operation on two Boolean variables.\n    \n    Args:\n    a (bool): The first Boolean variable.\n    b (bool): The second Boolean variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: The result of the OR operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a or b\n\ndef boolean_not(a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a logical NOT operation on a Boolean variable.\n    \n    Args:\n    a (bool): The Boolean variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: The result of the NOT operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return not a\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    a = True\n    b = False\n\n    print(\"Boolean AND:\", boolean_and(a, b))\n    print(\"Boolean OR:\", boolean_or(a, b))\n    print(\"Boolean NOT (a):\", boolean_not(a))\n    print(\"Boolean NOT (b):\", boolean_not(b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `boolean_and` function takes two Boolean variables `a` and `b` as input and returns `True` only if both `a` and `b` are `True`.\n*   The `boolean_or` function takes two Boolean variables `a` and `b` as input and returns `True` if either `a` or `b` (or both) is `True`.\n*   The `boolean_not` function takes a single Boolean variable `a` as input and returns the opposite of `a`, i.e., `True` if `a` is `False` and vice versa.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this code with `a = True` and `b = False`, you should see the following output:\n\n```\nBoolean AND: False\nBoolean OR: True\nBoolean NOT (a): False\nBoolean NOT (b): True\n```",
