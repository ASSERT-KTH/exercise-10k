  "answer": "**Even or Odd Number Checker**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is even or odd.\n\n```python\ndef check_even_or_odd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is even or odd.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for a number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number! Try again.\")\n\n    # Check if the number is even or odd\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"The number {num} is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The number {num} is odd.\")\n\ndef main():\n    check_even_or_odd()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `check_even_or_odd` function asks the user for a number using the `input` function.\n2. The `try-except` block is used to handle cases where the user enters something that is not a valid number.\n3. Once a valid number is entered, the program checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, the number is even.\n4. The program then prints out whether the number is even or odd.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print `The number 10 is even.`\n* If the user enters `11`, the program will print `The number 11 is odd.`\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g. `even_or_odd.py`) and run it using Python (e.g. `python even_or_odd.py`).",
