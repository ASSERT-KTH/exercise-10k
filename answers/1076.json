  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to print a calendar for a given month and year:\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef print_monthly_calendar(year, month):\n    # Create a plain text calendar\n    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Print the month and year\n    print(calendar.month_name[month], year)\n    print(\"Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\")\n\n    # Print the days of the month\n    for week in cal:\n        for day in week:\n            if day == 0:\n                print(\"  \", end=\" \")  # Print spaces for days not in the month\n            else:\n                print(f\"{day:>2}\", end=\" \")  # Print days with leading spaces\n        print()  # Print a newline after each week\n\n# Test the function\nprint_monthly_calendar(2024, 9)\n```\n\nThis program first creates a plain text calendar for the given month and year using the `calendar.monthcalendar` function. It then prints the month and year, followed by the days of the week. The program then uses a nested for loop to print the days of the month, with leading spaces for single-digit days and spaces for days not in the month.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calendar.monthcalendar` function returns a matrix representing a month\u2019s calendar. Each row represents a week; days outside of the month a represented by zeros.\n2. The outer for loop iterates over each week in the month.\n3. The inner for loop iterates over each day in the week.\n4. If the day is zero, the program prints two spaces to represent a day not in the month.\n5. If the day is not zero, the program prints the day with a leading space if it's a single-digit day.\n6. After printing each week, the program prints a newline to separate the weeks.\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nSeptember 2024\nMo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\n                   1\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n23 24 25 26 27 28 29\n30\n```",
