  "answer": "**Function to Find Unique Characters**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python function that finds the characters in the first string but not in the second string.\n\n```python\ndef find_unique_chars(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the characters in the first string but not in the second string.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of unique characters in str1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the strings to sets for efficient lookup\n    set1 = set(str1)\n    set2 = set(str2)\n\n    # Find the characters in set1 that are not in set2\n    unique_chars = list(set1 - set2)\n\n    return unique_chars\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"hello\"\n    str2 = \"world\"\n    print(find_unique_chars(str1, str2))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The function takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as input.\n2. It converts each string to a set for efficient lookup.\n3. It uses the set difference operation (`-`) to find the characters in `set1` that are not in `set2`.\n4. The result is converted back to a list and returned.\n\n**Note**: This function considers each character only once, even if it appears multiple times in the first string. If you want to preserve the original count of characters, you can use a different approach, such as using a dictionary to count the characters in each string.",
