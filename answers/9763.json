  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points**\n==============================================\n\nIn this program, we will calculate the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe Euclidean distance between two points `P1(x1, y1)` and `P2(x2, y2)` in 2D space is given by:\n\n`d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`\n\nFor 3D space, the formula is:\n\n`d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)`\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance_2d(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in 2D space.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): The second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef calculate_distance_3d(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in 3D space.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The first point (x1, y1, z1)\n        point2 (tuple): The second point (x2, y2, z2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1, z1 = point1\n    x2, y2, z2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2 + (z2 - z1)**2)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # 2D points\n    point1_2d = (1, 2)\n    point2_2d = (4, 6)\n    distance_2d = calculate_distance_2d(point1_2d, point2_2d)\n    print(f\"Distance between {point1_2d} and {point2_2d} in 2D space: {distance_2d}\")\n\n    # 3D points\n    point1_3d = (1, 2, 3)\n    point2_3d = (4, 6, 8)\n    distance_3d = calculate_distance_3d(point1_3d, point2_3d)\n    print(f\"Distance between {point1_3d} and {point2_3d} in 3D space: {distance_3d}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance_2d` function takes two points in 2D space as input and returns the distance between them using the Euclidean distance formula.\n2. The `calculate_distance_3d` function takes two points in 3D space as input and returns the distance between them using the Euclidean distance formula.\n3. In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use these functions to calculate the distance between two points in both 2D and 3D space.",
