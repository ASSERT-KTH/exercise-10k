  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax owed given the income and tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax owed given the income and tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax on.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The tax owed.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_owed = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_owed\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g. 25 for 25%): \"))\n\n    # Convert tax rate to decimal\n    tax_rate /= 100\n\n    # Calculate tax owed\n    tax_owed = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Tax owed: ${tax_owed:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income (e.g. 50000).\n3. Enter the tax rate (e.g. 25 for 25%).\n4. The program will calculate and print the tax owed.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple tax calculation where the tax rate is applied to the entire income.\n* In a real-world scenario, tax calculations can be more complex and involve multiple tax brackets, deductions, and exemptions.\n* This program is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual tax calculations.",
