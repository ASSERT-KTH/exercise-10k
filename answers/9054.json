  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between two players. The winner is determined using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if player1 == player2:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player1 == \"rock\" and player2 == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player1 == \"scissors\" and player2 == \"paper\") or \\\n         (player1 == \"paper\" and player2 == \"rock\"):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    player1 = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while player1 not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        player1 = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    computer = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {player1}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(player1, computer))\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (yes/no): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `determine_winner` function uses if/else statements to determine the winner of the game.\n3. The `play_game` function plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and prints the result.\n4. The `main` function allows the user to play the game multiple times.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nPlayer 1 wins!\n\nPlay again? (yes/no): yes\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): paper\n\nYou chose: paper\nComputer chose: rock\n\nPlayer 1 wins!\n\nPlay again? (yes/no): no\n```",
