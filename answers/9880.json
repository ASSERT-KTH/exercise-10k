  "answer": "**HTML Content Fetcher Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of a given URL.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Python 3.x\n* `requests` library (install with `pip install requests`)\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef fetch_html(url):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the HTML content of a given URL.\n    \n    Args:\n        url (str): The URL to fetch HTML content from.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The HTML content of the URL.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        return response.text\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    url = input(\"Enter a URL: \")\n    html_content = fetch_html(url)\n    if html_content:\n        print(html_content)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `fetch_html` function takes a URL as input and sends a GET request to the URL using the `requests` library.\n2. The `response.raise_for_status()` call raises an exception if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.\n3. The HTML content of the URL is returned as a string.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a URL.\n5. The `fetch_html` function is called with the user-input URL, and the HTML content is printed to the console if it is not `None`.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `html_fetcher.py`.\n2. Run the program using `python html_fetcher.py`.\n3. Enter a URL when prompted (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).\n4. The HTML content of the URL will be printed to the console.",
