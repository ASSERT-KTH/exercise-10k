  "prompt": "Write a program that uses loops to generate a specific pattern. The pattern consists of a series of numbers that increase by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, and decrease by 1 for each iteration of the inner loop. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The pattern should be repeated for the number of rows specified by the input.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that generates the specified pattern:\n```\nn = 5\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    for j in range(1, i+1):\n        print(j, end=' ')\n    for j in range(i-1, 0, -1):\n        print(j, end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nThis code uses two nested loops to generate the pattern. The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and the inner loops print the numbers in the required pattern. The `end=' '` argument in the `print()` function is used to print the numbers on the same line, separated by spaces.\n\nNote that the second inner loop starts from `i-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration, which produces the decreasing sequence of numbers. The `print()` function at the end of the outer loop is used to move to the next line after printing each row of the pattern.",
