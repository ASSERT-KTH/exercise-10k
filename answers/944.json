  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that uses a while loop to let the user guess a random number between 1 and 10.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    # Continue guessing until the correct number is guessed\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if guess < 1 or guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\n    # Print a success message with the number of attempts\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number {number_to_guess} in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)`.\n2. The program enters a while loop, which continues until the user guesses the correct number.\n3. Inside the loop, the program asks the user for their guess using `input()`.\n4. The program checks if the guess is a valid integer and within the correct range (1-10).\n5. If the guess is too low or too high, the program provides feedback and increments the number of attempts.\n6. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program prints a success message with the number of attempts.\n\n**Running the Program**\n----------------------\n\nSave the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `guessing_game.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python guessing_game.py`).
