  "answer": "**Measuring Execution Time with a Decorator**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a given function.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef measure_execution_time(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator to measure the execution time of a given function.\n\n    Args:\n        func: The function to be measured.\n\n    Returns:\n        A wrapper function that measures the execution time of the input function.\n    \"\"\"\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Record the start time\n        start_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Execute the function\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Record the end time\n        end_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Calculate the execution time\n        execution_time = end_time - start_time\n        \n        # Print the execution time\n        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.\")\n        \n        # Return the result of the function\n        return result\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n@measure_execution_time\ndef example_function():\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work\n    print(\"Example function executed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_function()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `measure_execution_time` decorator takes a function `func` as an argument.\n2. The `wraps` decorator from the `functools` module is used to preserve the metadata of the original function.\n3. The `wrapper` function records the start time, executes the input function, records the end time, and calculates the execution time.\n4. The execution time is printed to the console.\n5. The result of the input function is returned.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n----------------------\n\n* To make the decorator more flexible, you can add arguments to the decorator function, such as a `verbose` flag to control whether the execution time is printed or not.\n* You can also use a logging library instead of printing the execution time to the console.\n* To measure the execution time of a function with asynchronous code, you can use the `asyncio` library and modify the decorator accordingly.",
