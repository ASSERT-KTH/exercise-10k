  "answer": "**Sequence Iterator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of loops to iterate over a sequence and perform tasks. We will create a program that iterates over a list of numbers, performs calculations, and prints the results.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef sequence_iterator(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Iterate over a sequence, perform calculations, and print the results.\n    \n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize variables\n    total = 0\n    max_value = float('-inf')\n    min_value = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate over the sequence using a for loop\n    print(\"For Loop:\")\n    for num in sequence:\n        print(f\"Number: {num}\")\n        total += num\n        if num > max_value:\n            max_value = num\n        if num < min_value:\n            min_value = num\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Total: {total}\")\n    print(f\"Max Value: {max_value}\")\n    print(f\"Min Value: {min_value}\")\n\n    # Iterate over the sequence using a while loop\n    print(\"\\nWhile Loop:\")\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(sequence):\n        num = sequence[i]\n        print(f\"Number: {num}\")\n        i += 1\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a sample sequence\n    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    # Call the sequence iterator function\n    sequence_iterator(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `sequence_iterator` function takes a list of numbers as input and initializes variables to store the total, maximum, and minimum values.\n2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the sequence, performing calculations and updating the variables.\n3. The function prints the results, including the total, maximum, and minimum values.\n4. The function also demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to iterate over the sequence.\n5. The `main` function creates a sample sequence and calls the `sequence_iterator` function.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Iterate over a list of numbers and calculate the sum, average, and standard deviation.\n* Iterate over a list of strings and perform string manipulation tasks, such as concatenation and substring extraction.\n* Iterate over a list of objects and perform object-specific tasks, such as data validation and error handling.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Use `for` loops when you need to iterate over a sequence and perform tasks that depend on the current item.\n* Use `while` loops when you need to iterate over a sequence and perform tasks that depend on a condition that changes during iteration.\n* Always initialize variables and use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.\n* Use functions to encapsulate logic and improve code reusability.",
