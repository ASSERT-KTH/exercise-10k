  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. The user inputs their choice, and the program generates a random choice and determines the winner.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for their choice until they choose to stop playing. The user's choice is compared to the computer's random choice to determine the winner. \n* The program first asks the user to input their choice and checks if it is one of the allowed options (rock, paper, or scissors). If not, it asks again.\n* It then generates the computer's choice randomly from the list of possible choices.\n* The program compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the rules of rock, paper, scissors.\n* After each round, the program asks the user if they want to play again. If the user chooses to stop playing, the program ends.",
