  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their grades as input. The program should calculate the average grade of all students and then print out each student's name along with their grade and a message indicating whether they passed (grade 50 or above) or failed.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef grades(student_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a dictionary of student names and their grades.\n    Calculates the average grade of all students and prints out each student's name along with their grade and a message indicating whether they passed (grade 50 or above) or failed.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for student, grade in student_dict.items():\n        total += grade\n\n    average = total / len(student_dict)\n\n    for student, grade in student_dict.items():\n        if grade >= 50:\n            print(f\"{student}'s grade is {grade}. Passed!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{student}'s grade is {grade}. Failed!\")\n\n# Example usage\ngrades({'John': 55, 'Emma': 70, 'Michael': 35, 'Sarah': 60, 'William': 20})\n```\nThis code defines the `grades` function, which takes a dictionary `student_dict` as input. It calculates the total of all grades, then calculates the average grade by dividing the total by the number of students. Finally, it iterates through each student in the dictionary, prints out their name, grade, and a message indicating whether they passed or failed based on their grade. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `grades` function with a sample dictionary of students and their grades.",
