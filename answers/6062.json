  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program should use a while loop to keep asking for input until the correct number is guessed.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. **Import the `random` Module**: This module provides functionality for generating random numbers.\n2. **Define the `guess_number` Function**: This function contains the game logic.\n3. **Generate a Random Number**: The `random.randint(1, 100)` function generates a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n4. **Initialize the Number of Tries**: The `tries` variable keeps track of the number of guesses the user has made.\n5. **Game Loop**: The `while` loop continues to ask the user for input until they guess the correct number.\n6. **Get User Input**: The `input` function gets the user's guess.\n7. **Check for Quit**: If the user types \"quit\", the game ends and the correct number is revealed.\n8. **Validate User Input**: The program checks if the user's input can be converted to an integer. If not, it asks for input again.\n9. **Check the User's Guess**: The program checks if the user's guess is higher or lower than the correct number and provides feedback.\n10. **Win Condition**: If the user guesses the correct number, the game ends and the number of tries is displayed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `guessing_game.py`) and run it with Python (e.g., `python guessing_game.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
