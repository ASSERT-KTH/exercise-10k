  "answer": "### Mad Libs Story Generator\n\nHere's a Python function that creates a Mad Libs story based on user input. The function takes in several words (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper noun, and place) and inserts them into a story.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper_noun, place):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Mad Libs story based on user input.\n\n    Args:\n        noun (str): A noun (e.g. book, car, tree)\n        verb (str): A verb (e.g. run, jump, read)\n        adjective (str): An adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green)\n        adverb (str): An adverb (e.g. quickly, loudly, wisely)\n        proper_noun (str): A proper noun (e.g. John, New York, Google)\n        place (str): A place (e.g. park, city, beach)\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated Mad Libs story\n    \"\"\"\n    story = f\"One day, {proper_noun} went to the {place} and saw a very {adjective} {noun}. \" \\\n            f\"They decided to {verb} {adverb} around it, feeling very happy and free. \" \\\n            f\"After a while, they sat down under a tree and {verb} for a bit, enjoying the beautiful view.\"\n    return story\n\ndef main():\n    noun = input(\"Enter a noun (e.g. book, car, tree): \")\n    verb = input(\"Enter a verb (e.g. run, jump, read): \")\n    adjective = input(\"Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): \")\n    adverb = input(\"Enter an adverb (e.g. quickly, loudly, wisely): \")\n    proper_noun = input(\"Enter a proper noun (e.g. John, New York, Google): \")\n    place = input(\"Enter a place (e.g. park, city, beach): \")\n\n    print(\"\\nHere's your Mad Libs story:\")\n    print(generate_mad_libs(noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper_noun, place))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_mad_libs` function takes in six parameters: `noun`, `verb`, `adjective`, `adverb`, `proper_noun`, and `place`.\n2. It uses these parameters to create a Mad Libs story by inserting them into a template string using f-strings.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the required words and then calls the `generate_mad_libs` function with the user's input.\n4. Finally, it prints out the generated Mad Libs story.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the code, it will prompt you to input the required words. For example:\n\n```\nEnter a noun (e.g. book, car, tree): dog\nEnter a verb (e.g. run, jump, read): play\nEnter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): big\nEnter an adverb (e.g. quickly, loudly, wisely): quickly\nEnter a proper noun (e.g. John, New York, Google): John\nEnter a place (e.g. park, city, beach): park\n\nHere's your Mad Libs story:\nOne day, John went to the park and saw a very big dog. They decided to play quickly around it, feeling very happy and free. After a while, they sat down under a tree and play for a bit, enjoying the beautiful view.\n```",
