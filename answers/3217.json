  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and prints their mean, median, and mode.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    # Calculate mean\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate median\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate mode\n    try:\n        mode = statistics.mode(numbers)\n    except statistics.StatisticsError:\n        mode = \"No unique mode found\"\n    \n    return mean, median, mode\n\ndef main():\n    # Get a list of numbers from the user\n    input_str = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    numbers = [float(num) for num in input_str.split()]\n    \n    # Calculate and print statistics\n    mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.\n2. The `main` function gets a list of numbers from the user, calculates the statistics using the `calculate_statistics` function, and prints the results.\n3. The user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n4. The input string is split into a list of numbers using a list comprehension.\n5. The `calculate_statistics` function uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean, median, and mode.\n6. If there is not exactly one most common value (i.e., no unique mode), a `StatisticsError` is raised and the program prints \"No unique mode found\" instead of a mode.",
