  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The function should take a number as an argument and return the factorial.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the factorial of a given number, addressing your request for a clear and structured approach to this mathematical operation. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input number is negative. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n\n    # We initialize the result variable to 1. This will be used to store the factorial.\n    result = 1\n\n    # We loop through all numbers from 2 to the input number (inclusive).\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # For each number, we multiply the result by the current number.\n        result *= i\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated factorial.\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and first checks if it's negative. If so, it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n* It then initializes a variable `result` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the factorial.\n* The function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive), multiplying `result` by each number in this range to calculate the factorial.\n* Finally, it returns the calculated factorial stored in `result`.",
