  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a day of the week (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day name (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.)",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_day_of_week(day_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the day of the week corresponding to the input day number.\n    \n    Args:\n        day_number (int): The day of the week (1-7) where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input day number is not between 1 and 7.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define a dictionary mapping day numbers to day names\n    days_of_week = {\n        1: \"Monday\",\n        2: \"Tuesday\",\n        3: \"Wednesday\",\n        4: \"Thursday\",\n        5: \"Friday\",\n        6: \"Saturday\",\n        7: \"Sunday\"\n    }\n    \n    # Check if the input day number is valid\n    if day_number not in days_of_week:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid day number. Day number should be between 1 and 7.\")\n    \n    # Print the corresponding day name\n    print(days_of_week[day_number])\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    day_number = int(input(\"Enter the day of the week (1-7): \"))\n    print_day_of_week(day_number)\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The code defines a function `print_day_of_week` that takes an integer `day_number` as input.\n2. **Dictionary Mapping**: A dictionary `days_of_week` is created to map day numbers to their corresponding day names.\n3. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input `day_number` is valid (between 1 and 7). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n4. **Printing the Day Name**: If the input is valid, the function prints the corresponding day name using the dictionary mapping.\n5. **Example Usage**: In the `main` block, the code prompts the user to enter a day number, converts the input to an integer, and calls the `print_day_of_week` function with the user's input.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave this code in a file (e.g., `day_of_week.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python day_of_week.py`). When prompted, enter a day number between 1 and 7 to see the corresponding day name printed.",
