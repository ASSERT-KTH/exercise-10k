  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the characters that are in the first string but not in the second string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_unique_chars(s1, s2):\n    for c in s2:\n        s1 = s1.replace(c, \"\")\n    return s1\n\ns1 = \"hello\"\ns2 = \"world\"\nprint(find_unique_chars(s1, s2))\n```\nThis code defines the `find_unique_chars` function, which takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input. It iterates over each character `c` in `s2` and replaces all occurrences of `c` in `s1` with an empty string. Finally, it returns the modified string `s1`, which contains only the characters that are in `s1` but not in `s2`. The code then tests the function with the input strings \"hello\" and \"world\" and prints the result.",
