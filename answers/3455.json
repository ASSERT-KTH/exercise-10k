  "answer": "**Quiz Administration Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program will administer a simple quiz, asking the user a series of questions and keeping track of the score.\n\n**Program Code**\n---------------\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store the questions, answers, and options\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef administer_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Administer the quiz and keep track of the score.\n\n    Args:\n        questions (dict): A dictionary of questions, answers, and options.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The final score.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Choose the correct answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {options['answer']}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    score = administer_quiz(quiz_questions)\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `quiz.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python quiz.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to complete the quiz.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be presented with a series of questions. Choose the correct answer for each question by typing the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D). The program will keep track of your score and display it at the end of the quiz.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n* To add more questions to the quiz, simply add more entries to the `quiz_questions` dictionary.\n* To change the difficulty level of the quiz, modify the questions and options accordingly.\n* To implement a timer or other features, consider using additional libraries or modules.",
