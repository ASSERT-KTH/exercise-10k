  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the last index of the character in the string.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that finds the last index of a character in a given string. This function will take two parameters, a string and a character, and return the last index where the character appears in the string. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef last_index_of_char(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the last index of a given character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The last index of the character in the string. Returns -1 if the character is not found.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input string or character is not of type str.\n        ValueError: If the input character is not of length 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input string and character are of type str\n    if not isinstance(string, str) or not isinstance(char, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both string and character must be of type str.\")\n\n    # Check if the input character is of length 1\n    if len(char) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input character must be of length 1.\")\n\n    # Use the rfind method of the string class to find the last index of the character\n    # The rfind method returns -1 if the character is not found\n    last_index = string.rfind(char)\n\n    # Return the last index of the character\n    return last_index\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `last_index_of_char` checks if the input `string` and `char` are of type `str` to ensure correct functionality. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It also checks if the length of `char` is 1, because the problem statement asks for a single character. If the length is not 1, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* The function uses the `rfind` method of the string class to find the last index of `char` in `string`. This method returns `-1` if `char` is not found in `string`.\n* Finally, the function returns the last index of `char` in `string`.",
