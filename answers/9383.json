  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their division and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division and remainder.\n    \n    Args:\n        dividend (int or float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int or float): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the division result and the remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    \n    division_result = dividend / divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return division_result, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the division and remainder\n        division_result, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {division_result} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_and_remainder` that takes two numbers as input, calculates their division and remainder, and returns the results. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calls `divide_and_remainder`, and prints the results. It also handles the case where the user tries to divide by zero.",
