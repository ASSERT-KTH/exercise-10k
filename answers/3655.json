  "answer": "**Caesar Cipher Function**\n==========================\n\nThe following Python function implements a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter in the input string by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher(text: str, shift: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Shifts each letter in the input string by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input string to be shifted.\n        shift (int): The number of positions to shift the string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The shifted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n        else:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = \"Hello, World!\"\n    shift = 3\n    print(f\"Original text: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Shifted text: {caesar_cipher(text, shift)}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function iterates over each character in the input string.\n2. If the character is a letter (checked using `isalpha()`), it calculates the new character by shifting the ASCII value of the original character by the specified amount.\n3. The `ord()` function returns the ASCII value of a character, and `chr()` returns the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n4. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., 'z' shifted by 1 becomes 'a').\n5. Non-alphabetical characters (such as punctuation and spaces) are left unchanged.\n6. The shifted characters are appended to the `result` string, which is returned at the end of the function.\n\n**Note:** This implementation only shifts letters and leaves other characters unchanged. If you want to shift other characters as well, you will need to modify the function accordingly.",
