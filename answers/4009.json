  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a diamond pattern of asterisks:\n\n```python\ndef print_diamond(n):\n    # Print the top half of the diamond\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n        # Print asterisks\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        print()\n\n    # Print the bottom half of the diamond\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n        # Print asterisks\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        print()\n\n# Test the function\nprint_diamond(5)\n```\n\nThis program will print a diamond pattern of asterisks with a height of `2*n - 1`. You can adjust the value passed to the `print_diamond` function to change the size of the diamond.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:\n\n1. The `print_diamond` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the height of the diamond.\n2. The first nested loop prints the top half of the diamond. It iterates `n` times, and in each iteration:\n   - It prints `n - i - 1` leading spaces using a nested loop.\n   - It prints `2 * i + 1` asterisks using another nested loop.\n3. The second nested loop prints the bottom half of the diamond. It iterates from `n-2` down to `0`, and in each iteration:\n   - It prints `n - i - 1` leading spaces using a nested loop.\n   - It prints `2 * i + 1` asterisks using another nested loop.\n4. The `print_diamond` function is called with an argument of `5`, which prints a diamond pattern with a height of `9`.",
