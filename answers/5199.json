  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a recipe and then prints out the ingredients and instructions.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that asks for a recipe and prints out the ingredients and instructions:\n\n```python\nclass Recipe:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.ingredients = []\n        self.instructions = []\n\n    def add_ingredient(self, ingredient, quantity):\n        self.ingredients.append((ingredient, quantity))\n\n    def add_instruction(self, instruction):\n        self.instructions.append(instruction)\n\n    def print_recipe(self):\n        print(f\"**{self.name}**\")\n        print(\"\\n**Ingredients:**\")\n        for i, (ingredient, quantity) in enumerate(self.ingredients, start=1):\n            print(f\"{i}. {ingredient} - {quantity}\")\n        print(\"\\n**Instructions:**\")\n        for i, instruction in enumerate(self.instructions, start=1):\n            print(f\"{i}. {instruction}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Recipe Book!\")\n    recipe_name = input(\"Please enter the name of your recipe: \")\n\n    recipe = Recipe(recipe_name)\n\n    num_ingredients = int(input(\"How many ingredients does your recipe have? \"))\n\n    for i in range(num_ingredients):\n        ingredient = input(f\"Enter ingredient {i + 1}: \")\n        quantity = input(f\"Enter quantity for {ingredient}: \")\n        recipe.add_ingredient(ingredient, quantity)\n\n    num_instructions = int(input(\"How many instructions does your recipe have? \"))\n\n    for i in range(num_instructions):\n        instruction = input(f\"Enter instruction {i + 1}: \")\n        recipe.add_instruction(instruction)\n\n    recipe.print_recipe()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Create a `Recipe` class**: The class has attributes for the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.\n2. **Define methods**: Methods are defined to add ingredients and instructions, and to print the recipe.\n3. **Create a `main` function**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter the recipe name, number of ingredients, ingredients, number of instructions, and instructions.\n4. **Create a `Recipe` object**: An instance of the `Recipe` class is created with the user-provided recipe name.\n5. **Add ingredients and instructions**: The user-provided ingredients and instructions are added to the `Recipe` object.\n6. **Print the recipe**: The `print_recipe` method is called to print the recipe.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter the recipe name, number of ingredients, ingredients, number of instructions, and instructions. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to the Recipe Book!\nPlease enter the name of your recipe: Chocolate Cake\nHow many ingredients does your recipe have? 3\nEnter ingredient 1: Flour\nEnter quantity for Flour: 2 cups\nEnter ingredient 2: Sugar\nEnter quantity for Sugar: 1 cup\nEnter ingredient 3: Eggs\nEnter quantity for Eggs: 2\nHow many instructions does your recipe have? 2\nEnter instruction 1: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.\nEnter instruction 2: Mix ingredients and bake for 30 minutes.\n```\n\nAfter entering the recipe details, the program will print the recipe:\n\n```\n**Chocolate Cake**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n1. Flour - 2 cups\n2. Sugar - 1 cup\n3. Eggs - 2\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.\n2. Mix ingredients and bake for 30 minutes.\n```",
