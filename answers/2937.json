  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a tree of asterisks (*):\n\n```python\ndef print_tree(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a tree of asterisks (*) of given height.\n\n    Args:\n        height (int): The height of the tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(height):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for j in range(height - i - 1):\n            print(' ', end='')\n        # Print asterisks\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print('*', end='')\n        print()  # Move to next line\n\ndef main():\n    height = int(input(\"Enter the height of the tree: \"))\n    print_tree(height)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `print_tree` function takes an integer `height` as input, representing the height of the tree.\n2. The outer loop (`for i in range(height)`) iterates over each row of the tree.\n3. The first inner loop (`for j in range(height - i - 1)`) prints the leading spaces for each row. The number of spaces decreases by one for each row.\n4. The second inner loop (`for k in range(2 * i + 1)`) prints the asterisks for each row. The number of asterisks increases by two for each row.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the height of the tree and calls the `print_tree` function with the user's input.\n\n### Example output:\n\n```\nEnter the height of the tree: 5\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n```",
