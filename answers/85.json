  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Solution**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a list of strings, find the longest common prefix among all the strings.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem by using a simple iterative approach. The idea is to compare the characters at the same position in all the strings and update the common prefix accordingly.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among all the strings in the given list.\n\n    Args:\n    strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Find the shortest string in the list\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    # Iterate over the characters in the shortest string\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        # Check if the character is the same in all strings\n        for string in strs:\n            if string[i] != char:\n                # If the character is not the same, return the common prefix\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    # If all characters are the same, return the shortest string\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\nstrs = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strs))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2.  Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3.  Iterate over the characters in the shortest string.\n4.  For each character, check if it is the same in all strings at the same position.\n5.  If a mismatch is found, return the common prefix up to the previous character.\n6.  If all characters are the same, return the shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as we only need to store the shortest string and the common prefix, which has a fixed length.",
