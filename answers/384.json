  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the simple interest on a loan:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the simple interest on a loan given the principal amount, \n    interest rate, and time period.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of the loan.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (float): The time period of the loan in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest on the loan.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the simple interest using the formula: (P * R * T) / 100\n    # Since the rate is given as a decimal, we don't need to divide by 100\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    \n    return simple_interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The simple interest on the loan is: ${simple_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount to be paid is: ${principal + simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `calculate_simple_interest` function calculates the simple interest using the formula: `P * R * T`, where `P` is the principal amount, `R` is the interest rate, and `T` is the time period.\n2. The `main` function gets the principal amount, interest rate, and time period from the user, calculates the simple interest, and prints the result.\n3. The interest rate is converted from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n4. The result is printed with two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n* Run the program and enter the following values:\n\t+ Principal amount: 1000\n\t+ Interest rate: 5\n\t+ Time period: 2\n* The program will output:\n\t+ The simple interest on the loan is: $100.00\n\t+ The total amount to be paid is: $1100.00",
