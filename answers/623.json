  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of the cube's side.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns its volume.\n2. The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula `V = s^3`, where `s` is the side length.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the side length, calculates the volume using the `calculate_cube_volume` function, and prints the result.\n4. Error handling is implemented to ensure that the side length is a positive number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a side length of 5 to calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5 units.\n* Enter a side length of 10 to calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 10 units.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `cube_volume_calculator.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python cube_volume_calculator.py`).\n3. Follow the prompt to enter the side length of the cube.\n4. The program will calculate and print the volume of the cube.",
