  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that takes two lists of integers as input and returns a new list containing the common elements without duplicates, while preserving the original order. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists of integers as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are common to both input lists, without duplicates.\n    The function preserves the original order of elements.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of integers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the common elements from both input lists, without duplicates.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create an empty set to store the unique elements from the first list\n    set1 = set()\n\n    # Create an empty list to store the common elements\n    common = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for num in list1:\n        # Add the element to the set\n        set1.add(num)\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the second list\n    for num in list2:\n        # Check if the element is in the set and not already in the common list\n        if num in set1 and num not in common:\n            # Add the element to the common list\n            common.append(num)\n\n    # Return the common list\n    return common\n\n# Test the function\nprint(common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We start by creating an empty set `set1` to store unique elements from the first list `list1`, and an empty list `common` to store the common elements.\n* We iterate over each element in `list1` and add it to `set1` to remove duplicates from `list1`.\n* Then, we iterate over each element in `list2`, checking if it exists in `set1` and is not already in the `common` list. If the condition is met, we add the element to the `common` list.\n* Finally, we return the `common` list, which contains the common elements from both input lists, without duplicates, and in the original order.",
