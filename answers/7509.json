  "answer": "**Hangman Game Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Hangman game using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to guess from\nword_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word)\n\n    # Initialize the display with underscores\n    display = [\"_\"] * word_length\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_letters = []\n    guessed_words = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(display_hangman(tries))\n    print(\" \".join(display))\n\n    while not guessed and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Please guess a letter or word: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_letters:\n                print(\"You already guessed the letter\", guess)\n            elif guess not in word:\n                print(guess, \"is not in the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            else:\n                print(\"Good job,\", guess, \"is in the word!\")\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n                word_as_list = list(word)\n                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n                for index in indices:\n                    display[index] = guess\n        elif len(guess) == word_length and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_words:\n                print(\"You already guessed the word\", guess)\n            elif guess != word:\n                print(guess, \"is not the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_words.append(guess)\n            else:\n                guessed = True\n                display = list(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Not a valid guess.\")\n        \n        print(display_hangman(tries))\n        print(\" \".join(display))\n\n    if guessed:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you didn't guess the word.

Run the code.\n2. Guess a letter or the word by typing it in when prompted.\n3. The game will tell you if the letter is in the word or not. If it is, it will fill in the corresponding blanks.\n4. Keep guessing until you either guess the word or run out of tries (6 attempts).\n5. If you guess the word correctly, you win! If you run out of tries, the game will reveal the word.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nLet's say the randomly selected word is \"apple\". The game will display a series of underscores representing each letter in the word: `_ _ _ _ _`. You can then start guessing letters. If you guess a letter that is in the word, such as \"a\", the game will fill in the corresponding blanks: `a _ _ _ _`. If you guess a letter that is not in the word, the game will draw a part of the hangman's gallows. The goal is to guess the word before the gallows is complete.",
