  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n    return length * width\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 5\n    width = 3\n    area = rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate and print the area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 3. You can replace these values with your own input to get the area of a different rectangle.",
