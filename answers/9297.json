  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. This response will guide you through the implementation of the function. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The main string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the substring is empty. If it is, we return 0 as per the problem statement.\n    if not substring:\n        return 0\n\n    # We use Python's built-in str.find() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.\n    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1.\n    index = string.find(substring)\n\n    # We return the index, which is either the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found.\n    return index\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_substring` takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If the `substring` is empty, it returns 0.\n* We utilize Python's built-in `str.find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the `substring`. If the `substring` is not found, it returns -1.\n* The function returns the index, which is either the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found, as determined by the `find()` method.\n* The code includes a docstring that provides documentation for the function, including its parameters, return value, and behavior.",
