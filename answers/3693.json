  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the tip amount for a given bill amount and tip percentage.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the tip amount for a given bill amount and tip percentage:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(bill_amount, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip amount for a given bill amount and tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        bill_amount (float): The amount of the bill.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = bill_amount * tip_percentage\n    return tip_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the bill amount from the user\n    bill_amount = float(input(\"Enter the bill amount: $\"))\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (e.g. 15 for 15%): \"))\n    tip_percentage = tip_percentage / 100  # Convert to decimal\n\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(bill_amount, tip_percentage)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The tip amount is: ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount (bill + tip) is: ${bill_amount + tip_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* If the bill amount is $100 and the tip percentage is 15%, the program will calculate the tip amount as $15.00 and the total amount as $115.00.\n* If the bill amount is $50 and the tip percentage is 20%, the program will calculate the tip amount as $10.00 and the total amount as $60.00.\n\n### How to Run the Program:\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `tip_calculator.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g. `python tip_calculator.py`).\n3. Follow the prompts to enter the bill amount and tip percentage.\n4. The program will calculate and print the tip amount and total amount.",
