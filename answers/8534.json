  "answer": "**Change Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the change owed to a customer after a purchase. It takes the purchase amount and the payment amount as input and returns the change amount.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(purchase_amount, payment_amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the change owed to a customer after a purchase.\n\n    Args:\n        purchase_amount (float): The amount of the purchase.\n        payment_amount (float): The amount paid by the customer.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The change amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if payment_amount < purchase_amount:\n        raise ValueError(\"Payment amount is less than purchase amount\")\n\n    change_amount = payment_amount - purchase_amount\n    return change_amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Change Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    # Get the purchase amount from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            purchase_amount = float(input(\"Enter the purchase amount: $\"))\n            if purchase_amount < 0:\n                print(\"Purchase amount cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the payment amount from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            payment_amount = float(input(\"Enter the payment amount: $\"))\n            if payment_amount < 0:\n                print(\"Payment amount cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            elif payment_amount < purchase_amount:\n                print(\"Payment amount is less than purchase amount. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the change amount\n    change_amount = calculate_change(purchase_amount, payment_amount)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Change: ${change_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Purchase amount: $100.00\n*   Payment amount: $150.00\n*   Change: $50.00\n*   Purchase amount: $50.00\n*   Payment amount: $100.00\n*   Change: $50.00\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `change_calculator.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3.  Run the program by typing `python change_calculator.py` and pressing Enter.\n4.  Follow the prompts to enter the purchase amount and payment amount.\n5.  The program will calculate and display the change amount.",
