  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's negative. If so, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.\n3. For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This recursive call continues until `n` reaches 0 or 1.\n4. The final result is returned and printed to the console.\n\n**Note**: While recursion can be a elegant solution for calculating factorials, it's worth noting that for large values of `n`, an iterative solution would be more efficient to avoid potential stack overflow errors.",
