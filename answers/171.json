  "answer": "**Variable Scope Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the concept of variable scope in Python, including local and global variables. It shows how to access and modify variables with different scopes.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Nonlocal variable (local to outer_function)\n    outer_variable = 20\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local variable (local to inner_function)\n        inner_variable = 30\n\n        # Accessing global variable\n        print(\"Global variable:\", global_variable)\n\n        # Accessing outer variable (nonlocal)\n        print(\"Outer variable:\", outer_variable)\n\n        # Accessing local variable\n        print(\"Inner variable:\", inner_variable)\n\n        # Modifying global variable\n        global global_variable\n        global_variable += 10\n        print(\"Modified global variable:\", global_variable)\n\n        # Modifying outer variable (nonlocal)\n        nonlocal outer_variable\n        outer_variable += 10\n        print(\"Modified outer variable:\", outer_variable)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Outer variable after modification:\", outer_variable)\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global variable after modification:\", global_variable)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. **Global Variable**: `global_variable` is defined outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n2. **Nonlocal Variable**: `outer_variable` is defined inside `outer_function` but outside `inner_function`. It can be accessed from `inner_function` using the `nonlocal` keyword.\n3. **Local Variable**: `inner_variable` is defined inside `inner_function` and can only be accessed within that function.\n\n**Accessing Variables**\n\n*   To access a global variable from a function, simply use its name.\n*   To access a nonlocal variable from a nested function, use the `nonlocal` keyword.\n*   To access a local variable, simply use its name within the same function.\n\n**Modifying Variables**\n\n*   To modify a global variable from a function, use the `global` keyword.\n*   To modify a nonlocal variable from a nested function, use the `nonlocal` keyword.\n*   Local variables can be modified directly within their respective functions.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nGlobal variable: 10\nOuter variable: 20\nInner variable: 30\nModified global variable: 20\nModified outer variable: 30\nOuter variable after modification: 30\nGlobal variable after modification: 20\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates the different scopes of variables in Python and how to access and modify them.",
