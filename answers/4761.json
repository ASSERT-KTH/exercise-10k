  "prompt": "Write a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks a student's grade based on their score:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the student's grade based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = check_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `check_grade` function takes a `score` as an argument and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. **Grade Checking**: The function uses if-elif-else statements to check the `score` and return the corresponding grade.\n3. **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `check_grade` function by taking user input and printing the result.\n\n### Running the Program:\n\n1. Save the program as a Python file (e.g., `grade_checker.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python grade_checker.py`).\n3. Enter a score when prompted.\n4. The program will output the corresponding grade.",
