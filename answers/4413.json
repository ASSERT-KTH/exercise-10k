  "answer": "Here's a Python program that finds the index of a target element in a list using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a target element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search.\n        target: The target element to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, element in enumerate(lst):\n        if element == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7]\ntarget_num = 6\n\nindex = find_index(numbers, target_num)\n\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Target {target_num} found at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Target {target_num} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Define a function `find_index` that takes a list `lst` and a target element `target` as arguments.\n2. Use a for loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the list and access both the index `i` and the element `element`.\n3. Inside the loop, check if the current element is equal to the target element.\n4. If a match is found, return the index `i`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the list.\n6. In the example usage, create a list `numbers` and a target number `target_num`.\n7. Call the `find_index` function with the list and target number as arguments and store the result in the `index` variable.\n8. Print a message indicating whether the target number was found and its index if found.",
