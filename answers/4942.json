  "prompt": "Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score and prints out the corresponding grade using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that checks a student's grade based on their score and prints out the corresponding grade:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks the grade of a student based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if 0 <= score <= 100:\n        # Get the grade\n        grade = check_grade(score)\n        \n        # Print the grade\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `check_grade` function takes a score as input and checks it against various conditions to determine the grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the score from the user and checks if it's valid (between 0 and 100).\n3. If the score is valid, it calls the `check_grade` function to get the grade and prints it out.\n4. If the score is invalid, it prints an error message.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Enter a score of 95: The program will output \"The student's grade is: A\"\n* Enter a score of 75: The program will output \"The student's grade is: C\"\n* Enter a score of 120: The program will output \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\"",
