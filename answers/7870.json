  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a list of words is in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\ndef is_alphabetical_order(word_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a list of words is in alphabetical order.\n\n    Args:\n        word_list (list): A list of words.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the list is in alphabetical order, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for i in range(len(word_list) - 1):\n        # Check if the current word is greater than the next word\n        if word_list[i].lower() > word_list[i + 1].lower():\n            # If it is, return False\n            return False\n    # If the loop completes without finding any words out of order, return True\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\nif is_alphabetical_order(words):\n    print(\"The list is in alphabetical order.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The list is not in alphabetical order.\")\n\n# Test with an unordered list\nunordered_words = [\"cherry\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\nif is_alphabetical_order(unordered_words):\n    print(\"The list is in alphabetical order.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The list is not in alphabetical order.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Define a function `is_alphabetical_order` that takes a list of words as an argument.\n2. Iterate over the list of words using a for loop.\n3. Inside the loop, compare the current word with the next word using the `>` operator.\n4. If the current word is greater than the next word, it means the list is not in alphabetical order, so return `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding any words out of order, return `True`.\n6. In the example usage, create two lists of words: one that is in alphabetical order and one that is not.\n7. Call the `is_alphabetical_order` function with each list and print the result.\n\n**Note:** This program uses the `lower()` method to convert each word to lowercase before comparing it with the next word. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, so words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are considered equal.",
