  "prompt": "Write a program that evaluates a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that evaluates a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point.\n\n    Parameters:\n    coefficients (list): List of coefficients of the polynomial, from the constant term to the highest degree term.\n    x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: Value of the polynomial at the given point.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for degree, coefficient in enumerate(coefficients):\n        result += coefficient * (x ** degree)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ncoefficients = [3, 2, -1]  # represents the polynomial 3 + 2x - x^2\nx = 2\nresult = evaluate_polynomial(coefficients, x)\nprint(f\"The value of the polynomial at x = {x} is {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, the `evaluate_polynomial` function takes a list of coefficients and a point `x` as input, and returns the value of the polynomial at that point. The coefficients are assumed to be in the order of increasing degree, i.e. the first coefficient is the constant term, the second coefficient is the coefficient of the linear term, and so on.\n\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over the coefficients and calculates the value of each term by multiplying the coefficient with `x` raised to the power of the corresponding degree. The results are summed up to obtain the final value of the polynomial.\n\nThe example usage shows how to use the function to evaluate the polynomial 3 + 2x - x^2 at x = 2. The output should be 3 + 2*2 - 2^2 = 3 + 4 - 4 = 3.",
