  "answer": "**Age Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a person's age based on their birth year using conditional statements. It takes into account the current year and the person's birth year to determine their age.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_age(current_year, birth_year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a person's age based on their birth year.\n\n    Args:\n        current_year (int): The current year.\n        birth_year (int): The person's birth year.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The person's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    if current_year < birth_year:\n        raise ValueError(\"Birth year cannot be in the future\")\n    elif current_year == birth_year:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        age = current_year - birth_year\n        return age\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current year\n    from datetime import datetime\n    current_year = datetime.now().year\n\n    # Get the person's birth year\n    birth_year = int(input(\"Enter your birth year: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate the person's age\n        age = calculate_age(current_year, birth_year)\n        print(f\"Your age is: {age}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_age` function takes two arguments: `current_year` and `birth_year`.\n2. It checks if the `current_year` is less than the `birth_year`. If true, it raises a `ValueError` because the birth year cannot be in the future.\n3. If the `current_year` is equal to the `birth_year`, it returns 0, indicating that the person is less than 1 year old.\n4. Otherwise, it calculates the person's age by subtracting the `birth_year` from the `current_year`.\n5. The `main` function gets the current year using the `datetime` module and prompts the user to enter their birth year.\n6. It calls the `calculate_age` function with the current year and the user's birth year, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter your birth year when prompted.\n2. The program will display your age based on the current year.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the person's birth year is in the past. If the birth year is in the future, it will raise a `ValueError`.",
