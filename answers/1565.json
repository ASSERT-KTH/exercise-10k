  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generation**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(generate_fibonacci(10))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n*   It first checks for base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.\n*   For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0 and 1) and then enters a loop to generate the remaining terms.\n*   In each iteration of the loop, it appends the sum of the last two terms in the sequence to the end of the sequence.\n*   The loop continues until the length of the Fibonacci sequence reaches `n`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the example usage, it will print the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
