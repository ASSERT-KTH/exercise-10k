  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following is an example of a recursive function in Python to calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is less than 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if n is less than 0\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if `n` is less than 0, in which case it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   For any other positive integer `n`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this recursive function is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because the function makes n recursive calls to calculate the factorial.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this recursive function is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because each recursive call adds a layer to the system call stack, and the maximum depth of the call stack is n.",
