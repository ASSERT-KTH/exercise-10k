  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and returns its volume.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n```python\n# Comments explaining the code\n# This is a simple Python program that calculates the volume of a cube.\n# The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s^3, where s is the side length.\n# This program will take the side length as input from the user and print the volume.\n\n# Importing modules\nimport math\n\n# Defining functions\ndef cube_volume(s):\n    return s ** 3  # Calculate the volume of a cube\n\n# Main program\ns = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))  # Take side length as input from the user\nprint(\"The volume of the cube is:\", cube_volume(s))  # Print the volume of the cube\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further requests.",
