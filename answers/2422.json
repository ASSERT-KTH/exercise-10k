  "answer": "Here is a Python program that repeats back every line of input it receives, using a while loop, until it receives a blank line:\n\n```python\ndef echo_lines():\n    \"\"\"\n    Repeats back every line of input it receives until it receives a blank line.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        line = input()\n        if line.strip() == \"\":\n            break\n        print(line)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Enter lines of text. Type a blank line to exit.\")\n    echo_lines()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `echo_lines` function contains an infinite loop (`while True`) that continues to prompt the user for input until a blank line is entered.\n2. The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user.\n3. The `strip()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input line. If the resulting string is empty (`\"\"`), the loop breaks.\n4. If the input line is not blank, it is printed back to the user using the `print()` function.\n5. The `main` function provides a brief introduction to the program and calls the `echo_lines` function.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter lines of text. Type a blank line to exit.\nHello, World!\nHello, World!\nThis is a test line.\nThis is a test line.\n\n```",
