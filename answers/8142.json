  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game Implementation**\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game using Python and if/else statements.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        # Display game rules\n        print(\"Game Rules:\")\n        print(\"  - Rock crushes Scissors\")\n        print(\"  - Scissors cuts Paper\")\n        print(\"  - Paper covers Rock\")\n        print(\"  - Rock crushes Lizard\")\n        print(\"  - Lizard poisons Spock\")\n        print(\"  - Spock smashes Scissors\")\n        print(\"  - Scissors decapitates Lizard\")\n        print(\"  - Lizard eats Paper\")\n        print(\"  - Paper disproves Spock\")\n        print(\"  - Spock vaporizes Rock\")\n\n        # Get user choice\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock): \").lower()\n\n        # Validate user input\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\", \"lizard\", \"spock\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock: \").lower()\n\n        # Get computer choice\n        choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\", \"lizard\", \"spock\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Display user and computer choices\n        print(f\"\\nUser choice: {user_choice.capitalize()}\")\n        print(f\"Computer choice: {computer_choice.capitalize()}\\n\")\n\n        # Determine game outcome\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(\"It's a tie!\")\n        elif (\n            (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice in [\"scissors\", \"lizard\"])\n            or (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice in [\"paper\", \"lizard\"])\n            or (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice in [\"rock\", \"spock\"])\n            or (user_choice == \"lizard\" and computer_choice in [\"spock\", \"paper\"])\n            or (user_choice == \"spock\" and computer_choice in [\"scissors\", \"rock\"])\n        ):\n            print(\"User wins!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins!\")\n\n        # Play again?\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again == \"no\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n\n1. The `game` function is the main entry point of the program.\n2. The function displays the game rules and gets the user's choice.\n3. It validates the user's input to ensure it's one of the allowed choices.\n4. The computer's choice is randomly selected from the list of allowed choices.\n5. The user's and computer's choices are displayed.\n6. The function determines the game outcome based on the user's and computer's choices.\n7. The outcome is displayed, and the user is asked if they want to play again.\n8. If the user chooses to play again, the function loops back to the beginning. Otherwise, it exits.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nRun the program, and follow the prompts to play the game. For example:\n\n```\nGame Rules:\n  - Rock crushes Scissors\n  - Scissors cuts Paper\n  - Paper covers Rock\n  - Rock crushes Lizard\n  - Lizard poisons Spock\n  - Spock smashes Scissors\n  - Scissors decapitates Lizard\n  - Lizard eats Paper\n  - Paper disproves Spock\n  - Spock vaporizes Rock\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock): rock\n\nUser choice: Rock\nComputer choice: Scissors\n\nUser wins!\n\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): yes\n```",
