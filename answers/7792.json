  "answer": "**User Greeting Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their name and prints out a personalized greeting.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their name.\"\"\"\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    return user_name\n\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting with the provided name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(user_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter your name.\n3. The program will print out a greeting with your name.\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_name` function uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for their name.\n* The `print_greeting` function takes a name as input and prints out a greeting using an f-string.\n* The `main` function coordinates the program's execution by calling the `get_user_name` and `print_greeting` functions.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).",
