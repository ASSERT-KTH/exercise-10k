  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, rate, and time.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n        n (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The amount of money after the given time period, including interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate/n) ** (n*time)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year (default=1): \") or 1)\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)\n\n    print(f\"The amount after {time} years is: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes the principal amount, rate, time, and number of times interest is compounded per year as input.\n2. It calculates the amount of money after the given time period using the formula `A = P * (1 + r/n) ^ (n*t)`, where:\n\t* A is the amount of money after the given time period.\n\t* P is the principal amount.\n\t* r is the interest rate.\n\t* n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n\t* t is the time period in years.\n3. The `main` function asks the user for input and calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function to calculate the amount and compound interest.\n4. The program prints the amount after the given time period and the compound interest.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $1000, an interest rate of 4%, and a time period of 5 years, compounded annually.\n* Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $5000, an interest rate of 6%, and a time period of 10 years, compounded quarterly.",
