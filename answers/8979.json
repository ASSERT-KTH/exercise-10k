  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains only lowercase characters, False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that checks if a given string contains only lowercase characters. This function will return True if the string meets the condition and False otherwise. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_lowercase(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given string contains only lowercase characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the string contains only lowercase characters, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(s, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n\n    # We use the built-in islower() method in Python, which returns True if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, otherwise False.\n    # This method does not consider non-cased characters like spaces or punctuation, so it fits our needs perfectly.\n    return s.islower()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_lowercase(s)` first checks if the input `s` is a string using `isinstance(s, str)`. If not, it raises a TypeError with a message indicating that the input must be a string.\n* It then utilizes Python's built-in string method `islower()` to check if all cased characters in the string are lowercase. This method returns True if the string contains at least one cased character and all of them are lowercase; otherwise, it returns False.\n* The `islower()` method is suitable for this task because it ignores non-cased characters like spaces and punctuation, focusing only on the case of alphabetic characters.\n* By directly returning the result of `s.islower()`, the function provides a boolean answer to whether the input string contains only lowercase characters.",
