  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given its distance traveled and fuel consumption.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumption, unit='kmpl'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled by the vehicle in kilometers.\n        fuel_consumption (float): Fuel consumed by the vehicle in liters.\n        unit (str, optional): Unit of fuel efficiency. Defaults to 'kmpl'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Fuel efficiency of the vehicle in the specified unit.\n    \"\"\"\n    if unit == 'kmpl':\n        return distance / fuel_consumption\n    elif unit == 'mpg':\n        # 1 km = 0.621371 miles, 1 liter = 0.264172 gallons\n        return (distance * 0.621371) / (fuel_consumption * 0.264172)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid unit. Supported units are 'kmpl' and 'mpg'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: \"))\n    fuel_consumption = float(input(\"Enter the fuel consumption in liters: \"))\n    unit = input(\"Enter the unit of fuel efficiency (kmpl/mpg): \")\n\n    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumption, unit)\n\n    print(f\"The fuel efficiency of the vehicle is {fuel_efficiency:.2f} {unit}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_fuel_efficiency` that takes the distance traveled, fuel consumption, and unit of fuel efficiency as input and returns the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter the distance traveled, fuel consumption, and unit of fuel efficiency, and then calls the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function to calculate the fuel efficiency.\n\nThe program supports two units of fuel efficiency: kilometers per liter (kmpl) and miles per gallon (mpg). If the user enters an invalid unit, the program raises a `ValueError`.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the distance traveled, fuel consumption, and unit of fuel efficiency when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the distance traveled in kilometers: 500\nEnter the fuel consumption in liters: 50\nEnter the unit of fuel efficiency (kmpl/mpg): kmpl\nThe fuel efficiency of the vehicle is 10.00 kmpl.\n```",
