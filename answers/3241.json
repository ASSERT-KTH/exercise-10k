  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int or float): The first number.\n        b (int or float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n        # Calculate and print the sum\n        sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_numbers}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are the numbers to be added.\n2. It returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers.\n4. It attempts to convert the user's input into `float` values. If this fails (for example, if the user enters a string that can't be converted to a number), it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.\n5. If the input is valid, it calls `add_numbers` with the two numbers and prints the result.\n\n### Example use case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. For example:\n```\nEnter the first number: 5\nEnter the second number: 7\nThe sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is 12.0\n```",
