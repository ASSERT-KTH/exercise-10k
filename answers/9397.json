  "answer": "**Rounding a Number to the Nearest Integer**\n==============================================\n\nHere is a simple program in Python that rounds a given number to the nearest integer:\n\n```python\ndef round_to_nearest_integer(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5.7\n    rounded_num = round_to_nearest_integer(num)\n    print(f\"The number {num} rounded to the nearest integer is: {rounded_num}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `round_to_nearest_integer` function takes a floating-point number `num` as input.\n*   The built-in `round` function in Python is used to round the number to the nearest integer.\n*   The rounded integer is returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the function by rounding the number 5.7 to the nearest integer.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n*   The `round` function uses the \"banker's rounding\" algorithm, which rounds to the nearest even integer if the decimal part is exactly 0.5. For example, 3.5 would be rounded to 4, while 2.5 would be rounded to 2.\n*   If you want to use a different rounding algorithm, you can use the `math.floor` or `math.ceil` functions from the math module in Python.\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   This program assumes that the input is a valid floating-point number. If the input may be invalid (e.g., a string or None), you should add error checking code to handle such cases.",
