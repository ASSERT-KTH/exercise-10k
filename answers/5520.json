  "answer": "**Vertex Cover Problem: Greedy Algorithm Solution**\n=====================================================\n\nThe vertex cover problem is an NP-hard problem that involves finding a subset of vertices in a graph such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the subset. Here, we will implement a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.\n\n**Algorithm Overview**\n---------------------\n\nThe greedy algorithm works by selecting the vertex with the highest degree (i.e., the vertex with the most edges incident to it) and adding it to the vertex cover. We then remove all edges incident to this vertex and repeat the process until all edges have been covered.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n-----------------------\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the greedy algorithm for the vertex cover problem:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef greedy_vertex_cover(graph):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes a vertex cover for the given graph using a greedy algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        graph (networkx.Graph): The input graph.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of vertices that form a vertex cover for the graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    vertex_cover = []\n    edges = list(graph.edges)\n\n    while edges:\n        # Find the vertex with the highest degree\n        max_degree_vertex = max(graph.nodes, key=lambda node: graph.degree(node))\n\n        # Add the vertex to the vertex cover\n        vertex_cover.append(max_degree_vertex)\n\n        # Remove all edges incident to the selected vertex\n        edges_to_remove = [edge for edge in edges if max_degree_vertex in edge]\n        edges = [edge for edge in edges if edge not in edges_to_remove]\n\n        # Remove the selected vertex from the graph\n        graph.remove_node(max_degree_vertex)\n\n    return vertex_cover\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample graph\n    graph = nx.Graph()\n    graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)])\n\n    # Compute a vertex cover using the greedy algorithm\n    vertex_cover = greedy_vertex_cover(graph)\n\n    print(\"Vertex Cover:\", vertex_cover)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `greedy_vertex_cover` function takes a NetworkX graph as input and returns a list of vertices that form a vertex cover.\n2.  The algorithm iterates until all edges have been covered.\n3.  In each iteration, it finds the vertex with the highest degree using the `graph.degree` method.\n4.  The vertex is added to the vertex cover, and all edges incident to it are removed from the graph.\n5.  The process is repeated until all edges have been covered.\n\n**Note**: This greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution for the vertex cover problem, as it is an NP-hard problem. However, it can provide a reasonable approximation in many cases.",
