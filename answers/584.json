  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the first duplicate number in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def firstDuplicate(self, a):\n        seen = set()\n        for num in a:\n            if num in seen:\n                return num\n            seen.add(num)\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.firstDuplicate([2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]))  # Output: 3\nprint(solution.firstDuplicate([2, 4, 3, 5, 1]))  # Output: -1\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a single method `firstDuplicate`, which takes an array `a` as input and returns the first duplicate number in the array. The method uses a `set` called `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. It iterates through the array, checking if each number is in the `seen` set. If it is, it returns the number as the first duplicate. If not, it adds the number to the `seen` set. If it reaches the end of the array without finding a duplicate, it returns -1.\n\nThe example usage creates an instance of the `Solution` class and calls the `firstDuplicate` method on two different arrays, printing the results to the console.",
