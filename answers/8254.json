  "answer": "**Expense Tracker Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program allows users to track their expenses by adding, removing, and viewing expenses. It uses if/else statements to handle user input and perform the corresponding actions.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass ExpenseTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.expenses = {}\n\n    def add_expense(self):\n        \"\"\"Add a new expense\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter expense name: \")\n        amount = float(input(\"Enter expense amount: \"))\n        self.expenses[name] = amount\n        print(f\"Expense '{name}' added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_expense(self):\n        \"\"\"Remove an existing expense\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter expense name: \")\n        if name in self.expenses:\n            del self.expenses[name]\n            print(f\"Expense '{name}' removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Expense '{name}' not found.\")\n\n    def view_expenses(self):\n        \"\"\"View all expenses\"\"\"\n        if not self.expenses:\n            print(\"No expenses added yet.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Expenses:\")\n            for name, amount in self.expenses.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: ${amount:.2f}\")\n\n    def calculate_total(self):\n        \"\"\"Calculate the total expense\"\"\"\n        total = sum(self.expenses.values())\n        print(f\"Total expense: ${total:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    tracker = ExpenseTracker()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nExpense Tracker Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Expense\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Expense\")\n        print(\"3. View Expenses\")\n        print(\"4. Calculate Total\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            tracker.add_expense()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            tracker.remove_expense()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            tracker.view_expenses()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            tracker.calculate_total()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Adding an expense:\n\t* Enter `1` to add an expense.\n\t* Enter the expense name and amount.\n\t* The expense will be added to the tracker.\n2. Removing an expense:\n\t* Enter `2` to remove an expense.\n\t* Enter the expense name.\n\t* If the expense exists, it will be removed from the tracker.\n3. Viewing expenses:\n\t* Enter `3` to view all expenses.\n\t* If there are no expenses, a message will be displayed.\n\t* Otherwise, a list of expenses will be displayed.\n4. Calculating the total expense:\n\t* Enter `4` to calculate the total expense.\n\t* The total expense will be displayed.\n5. Exiting the program:\n\t* Enter `5` to exit the program.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a dictionary to store expenses, where the key is the expense name and the value is the expense amount.\n* The `add_expense` method adds a new expense to the tracker.\n* The `remove_expense` method removes an existing expense from the tracker.\n* The `view_expenses` method displays all expenses in the tracker.\n* The `calculate_total` method calculates the total expense by summing up all expense amounts.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the expense tracker.",
