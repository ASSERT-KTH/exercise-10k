  "answer": "**Greatest Common Factor (GCF) Calculator**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of two given numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcf(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCF of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    while num2:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return abs(num1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcf = calculate_gcf(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCF of {num1} and {num2} is {gcf}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `calculate_gcf` function takes two integers as input and returns their GCF.\n2.  The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly applies the formula `a = b` and `b = a % b` until `b` becomes 0.\n3.  At this point, `a` is the GCF of the original two numbers.\n4.  The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_gcf` function with an example.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file named `gcf_calculator.py` and execute it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython gcf_calculator.py\n```\n\nThis will output the GCF of the two numbers in the example usage. You can modify the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the GCF of different numbers.",
