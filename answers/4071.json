  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the string with all leading and trailing whitespace removed.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef trim(s):\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return s\n    start = 0\n    end = len(s) - 1\n    while start <= end and s[start] == ' ':\n        start += 1\n    while start <= end and s[end] == ' ':\n        end -= 1\n    return s[start:end+1]\n\n# Test the function\ns = '   hello world   '\nprint('[' + s + ']')  # ['   hello world   ']\nprint('[' + trim(s) + ']')  # [hello world]\n```\nThis code defines the `trim` function, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string `s`. It uses two while loops to find the first and last non-whitespace characters in the string, and then returns a substring of `s` that starts at the first non-whitespace character and ends at the last non-whitespace character. The test code creates a string `s` with leading and trailing whitespace, prints it, calls the `trim` function on it, and prints the result.",
