  "prompt": "Create a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n    \n    Args:\n        num (int): The number for which the multiplication table is to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Multiplication table for {num}:\")\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{num} x {i} = {num * i}\")\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    print_multiplication_table(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `print_multiplication_table` function takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.\n2. **Looping through Multiples**: A `for` loop is used to iterate from 1 to 10, calculating and printing the product of the input number with each multiple.\n3. **User Input**: In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `print_multiplication_table` function.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask for a number. Let's say you enter `5`. The output will be:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\nMultiplication table for 5:\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```\n\nThis shows the multiplication table for 5 up to 10. You can replace `5` with any number to see its multiplication table.",
