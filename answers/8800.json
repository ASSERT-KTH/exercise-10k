  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that takes two numbers as input and returns the remainder of the division:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the remainder of the division of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The remainder of the division.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n        remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_remainder` that calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers using the modulus operator (`%`). It also includes a `main` function that gets the two numbers from the user, calls `calculate_remainder`, and prints the result. If the user tries to divide by zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.",
