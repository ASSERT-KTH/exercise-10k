  "prompt": "Write a function to find the maximum sum of a subarray within a given one-dimensional array of numbers. The function should take an array of integers as input and return the maximum sum of a subarray. If the input array is empty, the function should return 0.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef maxSubArray(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    for num in nums:\n        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n\n    return max_sum\n```\nI've carefully followed the step-by-step explanation and implemented the code accordingly. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
