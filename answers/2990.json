  "answer": "**Sum of Squares Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the given list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = sum_of_squares(numbers)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares of {numbers} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_of_squares` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to calculate the square of each number in the list.\n3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of these squares.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `sum_of_squares` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the sum of squares of a list of integers: `sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`\n* Calculate the sum of squares of a list of floats: `sum_of_squares([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5])`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave the code in a file named `sum_of_squares.py` and run it using Python: `python sum_of_squares.py`",
