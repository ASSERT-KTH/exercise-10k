  "prompt": "Create a program that converts time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses conditional statements to convert time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_24_hour(time_str):\n    components = time_str.split()\n    time_components = components[0].split(\":\")\n    hours = int(time_components[0])\n    minutes = int(time_components[1])\n    seconds = int(time_components[2])\n    period = components[1]\n\n    if period == \"AM\":\n        if hours == 12:\n            hours = 0\n    elif period == \"PM\":\n        if hours != 12:\n            hours += 12\n\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}\"\n\ntime_str = input(\"Enter time in 12-hour format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM): \")\nprint(f\"Time in 24-hour format: {convert_to_24_hour(time_str)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `convert_to_24_hour` that takes a string representing time in 12-hour format as input.\n2. The function splits the input string into time components (hours, minutes, seconds) and the period (AM/PM).\n3. It uses conditional statements to adjust the hours based on the period.\n   * If the period is AM and the hours are 12, it sets the hours to 0 (since 12:00 AM is equivalent to 00:00 in 24-hour format).\n   * If the period is PM and the hours are not 12, it adds 12 to the hours (since PM hours are 12 hours ahead of AM hours).\n4. The function returns the time in 24-hour format as a string, padding the hours, minutes, and seconds with zeros if necessary.\n5. The program takes user input for the time in 12-hour format and prints the converted time in 24-hour format.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Input: `08:30:00 AM`\n  Output: `08:30:00`\n* Input: `05:45:00 PM`\n  Output: `17:45:00`\n* Input: `12:00:00 AM`\n  Output: `00:00:00`\n* Input: `12:00:00 PM`\n  Output: `12:00:00`",
