  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function checks if a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given integer is a prime number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is prime: {is_prime(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Check for numbers less than or equal to 1**: Prime numbers are greater than 1, so we immediately return `False` for these cases.\n2.  **Iterate from 2 to the square root of n**: We only need to check up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n3.  **Check for divisibility**: If `n` is divisible by any number in the range, it's not a prime number, so we return `False`.\n4.  **Return True for prime numbers**: If `n` passes all the checks, it's a prime number, so we return `True`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(\u221an) due to the loop that iterates up to the square root of `n`. This is a significant improvement over a naive approach that checks all the way up to `n`, which would have a time complexity of O(n).",
