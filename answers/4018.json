  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to sum all the odd numbers from 1 to 10.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to sum all the odd numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\ndef sum_odd_numbers():\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\nprint(sum_odd_numbers())\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `sum_odd_numbers()` that initializes a variable `total` to 0. We then use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is odd by using the condition `i % 2 != 0`. If the number is odd, we add it to the `total`. Finally, we return the `total` and print the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output `25`, which is the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 10: `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`.\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We use the `range(1, 11)` function to generate numbers from 1 to 10.\n*   The `if i % 2 != 0` condition checks if a number is odd. If the remainder of the division of `i` by 2 is not equal to 0, then `i` is an odd number.\n*   We use the `+=` operator to add the current odd number to the `total`.\n*   Finally, we return the `total`, which is the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Summing all odd numbers in a given range.\n*   Filtering out even numbers from a list.\n*   Calculating the sum of odd numbers in a mathematical expression.",
