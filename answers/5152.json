  "answer": "### Finding Common Keys Between Two Dictionaries\n\nYou can use the `set.intersection()` method in Python to find the common keys between two dictionaries. Here's how you can do it:\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_common_keys(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the common keys between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of common keys between the two dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(dict1.keys()).intersection(set(dict2.keys()))\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}\n\ncommon_keys = find_common_keys(dict1, dict2)\nprint(common_keys)  # Output: {'b', 'c'}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `find_common_keys()` that takes two dictionaries as arguments.\n2. Convert the keys of each dictionary to a set using the `set()` function.\n3. Use the `intersection()` method to find the common elements between the two sets.\n4. Return the set of common keys.\n\nNote that this method returns a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. If you need a list or a specific order, you can convert the set to a list or sort it accordingly.\n\n#### Alternative Method\n\nYou can also use the `&` operator to find the intersection of two sets:\n\n```python\ndef find_common_keys(dict1, dict2):\n    return set(dict1.keys()) & set(dict2.keys())\n```\n\nThis method is more concise and achieves the same result as the previous example.",
