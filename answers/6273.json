  "answer": "### Filtering a Dictionary\n\nYou can filter a dictionary using dictionary comprehension in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose we have a dictionary of students with their ages and we want to filter it to only include students who are above 18 years old.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define the dictionary\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 17,\n    \"Bob\": 25,\n    \"Charlie\": 19,\n    \"David\": 15\n}\n\n# Define the condition function\ndef is_adult(age):\n    \"\"\"Check if a person is an adult (above 18 years old)\"\"\"\n    return age > 18\n\n# Filter the dictionary\nadult_students = {name: age for name, age in students.items() if is_adult(age)}\n\n# Print the filtered dictionary\nprint(adult_students)\n```\n\n#### Output\n\n```python\n{'John': 20, 'Bob': 25, 'Charlie': 19}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We define a dictionary `students` with student names as keys and their ages as values.\n2. We define a function `is_adult` that checks if a person is an adult (above 18 years old).\n3. We use dictionary comprehension to filter the `students` dictionary. We iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary and include it in the new dictionary `adult_students` only if the value (age) meets the condition specified by the `is_adult` function.\n4. Finally, we print the filtered dictionary `adult_students`.\n\n#### Alternative Approach\n\nYou can also use the `filter` function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nadult_students = dict(filter(lambda item: item[1] > 18, students.items()))\n```\n\nThis approach uses a lambda function to define the filtering condition and the `filter` function to apply it to the dictionary items. The resulting filter object is then converted back to a dictionary using the `dict` constructor.",
