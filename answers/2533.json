It sorts the edges by weight, iterates through them, and adds the edge to the MST if it doesn't create a cycle.\n5.  **Example Usage**: The example demonstrates how to create a graph, add edges, and print the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is O(E log E) or O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is because the algorithm involves sorting the edges by weight.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V + E), as it requires storing the parent and rank arrays for the vertices, as well as the edges in the graph.",
