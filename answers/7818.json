  "answer": "**Character Frequency Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the frequency of each character in a given string. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character and then prints the results.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef print_frequency_results(frequency_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the frequency results.\n\n    Args:\n        frequency_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"Character: {char}, Frequency: {frequency}\")\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = calculate_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print_frequency_results(frequency_dict)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a string when prompted (e.g., \"Hello, World!\").\n3. The program will print the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nEnter a string: Hello, World!\nCharacter: H, Frequency: 1\nCharacter: e, Frequency: 1\nCharacter: l, Frequency: 3\nCharacter: o, Frequency: 2\nCharacter: ,, Frequency: 1\nCharacter:  , Frequency: 1\nCharacter: W, Frequency: 1\nCharacter: r, Frequency: 1\nCharacter: d, Frequency: 1\nCharacter: !, Frequency: 1\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters.\n* The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character, which allows for efficient lookups and updates.\n* The `calculate_character_frequency` function returns a dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.\n* The `print_frequency_results` function prints the frequency results in a readable format.",
