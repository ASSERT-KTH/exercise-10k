  "answer": "**Story Template Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a story template with placeholders for different types of words and asks the user to input words to fill in the placeholders. It then prints out the completed story.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport re\n\ndef get_word_from_user(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Get a word from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        word = input(prompt)\n        if word:  # Check if the input is not empty\n            return word\n        print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\ndef fill_in_template(template):\n    \"\"\"Fill in the template with user input.\"\"\"\n    # Define a dictionary to store the word types and their corresponding prompts\n    word_types = {\n        \"noun\": \"Enter a noun: \",\n        \"verb\": \"Enter a verb: \",\n        \"adjective\": \"Enter an adjective: \",\n        \"adverb\": \"Enter an adverb: \",\n        \"place\": \"Enter a place: \",\n        \"person\": \"Enter a person's name: \"\n    }\n\n    # Use regular expression to find the placeholders in the template\n    placeholders = re.findall(r\"\\{(.*?)\\}\", template)\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the user input\n    user_input = {}\n\n    # Ask the user to input words for each placeholder\n    for placeholder in placeholders:\n        word_type = placeholder.lower()\n        if word_type in word_types:\n            user_input[placeholder] = get_word_from_user(word_types[word_type])\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unknown word type: {word_type}\")\n\n    # Fill in the template with the user input\n    completed_story = template\n    for placeholder, word in user_input.items():\n        completed_story = completed_story.replace(\"{\" + placeholder + \"}\", word)\n\n    return completed_story\n\ndef main():\n    # Define a story template with placeholders\n    template = \"Once upon a time, in a {adjective} {place}, there lived a {adjective} {person} who loved to {verb} {adverb}. One day, while wandering through the {place}, they stumbled upon a {noun} and decided to take it home.\"\n\n    # Fill in the template with user input and print the completed story\n    completed_story = fill_in_template(template)\n    print(\"\\nCompleted Story:\")\n    print(completed_story)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to input words to fill in the placeholders. Here's an example:\n\n```\nEnter a noun: book\nEnter a verb: read\nEnter an adjective: beautiful\nEnter a person's name: Alice\nEnter an adverb: quickly\nEnter a place: forest\nEnter an adjective: happy\nEnter a place: park\n\nCompleted Story:\nOnce upon a time, in a beautiful forest, there lived a happy Alice who loved to read quickly. One day, while wandering through the park, they stumbled upon a book and decided to take it home.\n```\n\nNote that you can modify the story template and the word types to suit your needs.",
