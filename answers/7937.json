  "answer": "**Acceleration Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the acceleration of an object given its initial and final velocities and the time over which the acceleration occurs.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula to calculate acceleration is:\n\na = (v_f - v_i) / t\n\nwhere:\n- a = acceleration (m/s^2)\n- v_f = final velocity (m/s)\n- v_i = initial velocity (m/s)\n- t = time (s)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the acceleration given the initial and final velocities and time.\n\n    Args:\n    - initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object (m/s)\n    - final_velocity (float): The final velocity of the object (m/s)\n    - time (float): The time over which the acceleration occurs (s)\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The acceleration of the object (m/s^2)\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Time cannot be zero\")\n\n    acceleration = (final_velocity - initial_velocity) / time\n    return acceleration\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    initial_velocity = float(input(\"Enter the initial velocity (m/s): \"))\n    final_velocity = float(input(\"Enter the final velocity (m/s): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time (s): \"))\n\n    try:\n        acceleration = calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time)\n        print(f\"The acceleration is {acceleration:.2f} m/s^2\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_acceleration` that takes the initial velocity, final velocity, and time as arguments.\n2. The function calculates the acceleration using the formula `a = (v_f - v_i) / t`.\n3. The program includes a `main` function that demonstrates how to use the `calculate_acceleration` function.\n4. The user is prompted to enter the initial velocity, final velocity, and time.\n5. The program calculates the acceleration and prints the result.\n6. The program includes error handling to prevent division by zero. If the time is zero, the program raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.",
