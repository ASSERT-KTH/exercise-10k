  "prompt": "Write a program to print a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should consist of a series of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input provided by the user. For example, if the input is 5, the pattern should be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Use a for loop to achieve this.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the pattern of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number up to which the pattern should be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i, end=\" \")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input from the user\n    n = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Print the pattern\n    print_pattern(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: We define a function called `print_pattern` that takes an integer `n` as input. This function will print the pattern of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n2.  **Loop**: Inside the `print_pattern` function, we use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.\n3.  **Printing Numbers**: Inside the loop, we print the current number `i` followed by a space. The `end` parameter of the `print` function is set to `\" \"` to ensure that all numbers are printed on the same line, separated by spaces.\n4.  **Main Function**: The `main` function gets the input from the user using the `input` function, converts it to an integer, and then calls the `print_pattern` function with the input number `n`.\n5.  **Example Usage**: When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a number. If you enter 5, the output will be: `1 2 3 4 5`.",
