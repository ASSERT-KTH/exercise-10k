  "answer": "**Longest Word in a Sentence**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python program that finds the longest word in a given sentence using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_longest_word(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest word in a given sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest word in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into words\n    longest_word = \"\"  # Initialize the longest word\n    max_length = 0  # Initialize the maximum length\n\n    for word in words:\n        word = word.strip(\".,!?:;\")  # Remove punctuation\n        if len(word) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(word)\n            longest_word = word\n\n    return longest_word\n\ndef main():\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    longest_word = find_longest_word(sentence)\n    print(f\"The longest word is: {longest_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `find_longest_word` function splits the input sentence into words using the `split` method.\n2. It initializes the `longest_word` variable to an empty string and the `max_length` variable to 0.\n3. The function then iterates over each word in the sentence using a for loop.\n4. Inside the loop, it removes any punctuation from the word using the `strip` method.\n5. If the length of the current word is greater than the `max_length`, it updates the `max_length` and the `longest_word` variables.\n6. Finally, the function returns the longest word.\n7. The `main` function gets a sentence from the user, finds the longest word using the `find_longest_word` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence. For example:\n```\nEnter a sentence: This is a test sentence with a very long word\nThe longest word is: sentence\n```",
