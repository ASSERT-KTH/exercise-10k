  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should prompt the user to enter their name, and then print out a message in the format 'Hello, <name>!'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. Prompts the user to enter their name using the `input()` function.\n2. Stores the user's input in the `name` variable.\n3. Prints out a greeting message that includes the user's name, using string concatenation to combine the strings \"Hello, \", the value of `name`, and \"!\".\n\nNote that I've followed the specifications exactly, using the `input()` function to get the user's input and string concatenation to build the greeting message. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code in more detail!",
