Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operator. Please try again.\")\n\ncalculator()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `calculator()` that encapsulates our calculator program.\n2. **User Input**: We prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator. We use `float()` to allow for decimal numbers.\n3. **Operator Check**: We use an `if-elif-else` statement to check the operator and perform the corresponding operation.\n4. **Division Check**: We check if the second number is zero before performing division to avoid a division by zero error.\n5. **Result Output**: We print the result of the operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `+` as the operator, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n* Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `-` as the operator, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 - 5 = 5.0`.\n* Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `*` as the operator, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 * 5 = 50.0`.\n* Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `/` as the operator, and `2` as the second number. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
