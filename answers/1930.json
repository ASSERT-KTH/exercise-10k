  "prompt": "Write a program that declares a tuple variable and prints its elements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that declares a tuple variable and prints its elements:\n\n```python\n# Declare a tuple variable\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(\"My Tuple: \", my_tuple)\n\n# Print each element of the tuple\nfor i in range(len(my_tuple)):\n    print(\"Element at index\", i, \"is:\", my_tuple[i])\n```\n\nThis program will output:\n```\nMy Tuple:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nElement at index 0 is: 1\nElement at index 1 is: 2\nElement at index 2 is: 3\nElement at index 3 is: 4\nElement at index 4 is: 5\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a for loop to iterate over the tuple directly, without needing to use indices:\n\n```python\n# Declare a tuple variable\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(\"My Tuple: \", my_tuple)\n\n# Print each element of the tuple\nfor element in my_tuple:\n    print(\"Element:\", element)\n```\n\nThis will produce the same output as the previous example. \n\nYou can also use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and value of each element in the tuple:\n\n```python\n# Declare a tuple variable\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(\"My Tuple: \", my_tuple)\n\n# Print each element of the tuple\nfor index, element in enumerate(my_tuple):\n    print(\"Element at index\", index, \"is:\", element)\n```\n\nThis will also produce the same output as the previous examples.",
