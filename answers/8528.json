  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    base (float): The base of the triangle.\n    height (float): The height of the triangle.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be greater than 0.\")\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and height from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the area\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_triangle_area` function calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height using the formula: `area = 0.5 * base * height`.\n*   The function checks if the base and height are greater than 0 and raises a `ValueError` if either is not.\n*   The `main` function gets the base and height from the user, calls `calculate_triangle_area` to calculate the area, and prints the result. It also catches and handles any `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised.\n*   The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the `calculate_triangle_area` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a base of 5 and a height of 6 to calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units.\n*   Enter a base of 10 and a height of 0 to see an error message because the height is not greater than 0.",
