  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year and prints a corresponding message:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n    \n    A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, \n    which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, \n    although 1900 was not.\n\n    Parameters:\n    year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if a given year is a leap year by following these rules:\n   - The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n   - If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible by 400.\n2. The `main` function gets a year from the user and checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function.\n3. It then prints a message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n- If the user enters `2020`, the program will print `2020 is a leap year.`\n- If the user enters `2019`, the program will print `2019 is not a leap year.`",
