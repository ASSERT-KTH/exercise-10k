  "answer": "**Next Greater Element Program**\n================================\n\nThis program uses a stack-based approach to find the next greater element for each element in a given array of numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef next_greater_element(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the next greater element for each element in the given array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of next greater elements for each element in the input array.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    result = [-1] * len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack\n        while stack and arr[i] > arr[stack[-1]]:\n            # Pop the top of the stack and update the result\n            index = stack.pop()\n            result[index] = arr[i]\n        # Push the current index onto the stack\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    arr = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]\n    next_greater = next_greater_element(arr)\n    print(\"Next greater elements:\", next_greater)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Initialize an empty stack and a result list with the same length as the input array, filled with -1.\n2.  Iterate through the input array. For each element:\n    *   While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack:\n        *   Pop the top of the stack and update the result list with the current element as the next greater element.\n    *   Push the current index onto the stack.\n3.  Return the result list containing the next greater elements for each element in the input array.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nInput array: `[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]`\n\nOutput: `[-1, 10, 10, -1, 10]`\n\nIn this example, the next greater elements are:\n\n*   For 4, there is no greater element, so -1.\n*   For 5, the next greater element is 10.\n*   For 2, the next greater element is 10.\n*   For 10, there is no greater element, so -1.\n*   For 8, the next greater element is 10.",
