  "answer": "**Minimum Number of Coins Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n    - coins (list): A list of available coin denominations.\n    - amount (int): The amount for which we need to make change.\n\n    Returns:\n    - int: The minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the given amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # We need 0 coins to make change for 0 amount\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If we cannot make change for the given amount, return -1\n    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return dp[amount]\n\n# Example usage\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Create a list `dp` of size `amount + 1` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the given amount.\n2.  Initialize `dp[0]` to 0, as we need 0 coins to make change for 0 amount.\n3.  Iterate over each coin denomination and update the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount.\n4.  If we cannot make change for the given amount, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum number of coins needed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this function is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the given amount and len(coins) is the number of available coin denominations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this function is O(amount), as we need to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the given amount.",
