  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of Numbers in a List using a For Loop**\n\nHere is a Python program to calculate the average of numbers in a list using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of the numbers in the list is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the numbers in the list.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list, adding it to the `total`.\n4. After the loop finishes, calculate the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the list.\n5. Return the calculated average.\n6. In the `main` function, demonstrate how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Note:** This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur. You may want to add error handling to handle this case, depending on your specific requirements.",
