  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the maximum sum of a subarray within a given one-dimensional array of integers. This function will take an array of integers as input and return the maximum sum of a subarray, handling the case where the array is empty. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_sum(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum sum of a subarray within a given one-dimensional array of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum sum of a subarray. If the array is empty, it returns 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the array is empty. If it is, return 0 as per the problem statement.\n    if not array:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize the maximum current sum and the maximum global sum to the first element of the array.\n    # This is because the maximum sum of a subarray must be at least the maximum single element in the array.\n    max_current = max_global = array[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n    for i in range(1, len(array)):\n        # For each element, calculate the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous maximum current sum.\n        # This is because the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current position is either the current element itself or the sum of the current element and the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the previous position.\n        max_current = max(array[i], max_current + array[i])\n        \n        # Update the maximum global sum if the maximum current sum is greater than the maximum global sum.\n        if max_current > max_global:\n            max_global = max_current\n\n    # Return the maximum global sum, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in the entire array.\n    return max_global\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `max_subarray_sum` first checks if the input `array` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 as per the problem statement.\n* It then initializes `max_current` and `max_global` to the first element of the `array`. This is because the maximum sum of a subarray must be at least the maximum single element in the array.\n* The function iterates over the `array` starting from the second element, updating `max_current` to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `max_current`. It also updates `max_global` if `max_current` is greater.\n* Finally, the function returns `max_global`, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in the entire `array`.",
