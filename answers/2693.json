  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a username as input and determines whether it is valid based on the following conditions: the username must be at least 3 characters long and contain only letters and numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_username(username):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a username based on the following conditions:\n    - The username must be at least 3 characters long.\n    - The username must contain only letters and numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        username (str): The username to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the username is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the username is at least 3 characters long\n    if len(username) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the username contains only letters and numbers\n    if not re.match(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$\", username):\n        return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the username is valid\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    username = input(\"Enter a username: \")\n    if validate_username(username):\n        print(\"The username is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The username is not valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Username Input**: The program first asks for a username as input from the user.\n2. **Validation Function**: The `validate_username` function checks the username based on two conditions:\n   - **Length**: It checks if the username is at least 3 characters long.\n   - **Characters**: It uses a regular expression (`re.match(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$\", username)`) to check if the username contains only letters (both lowercase and uppercase) and numbers.\n3. **Result**: If the username passes both checks, the function returns `True`, indicating that the username is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the program, calling `validate_username` with the user's input and printing whether the username is valid or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Valid usernames: `user123`, `hello`, `a1b2c3`\n- Invalid usernames: `us` (too short), `user!` (contains non-alphanumeric character)",
