The program uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm, which is a mathematical formula that calculates the day of the week given a date.\n2. The algorithm takes into account the year, month, and day of the date.\n3. The program uses a list `t` to store the constants used in the algorithm for each month.\n4. The `calculate_day_of_week` function calculates the day of the week using the algorithm and returns the result as a string.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the year, month, and day, and then calls the `calculate_day_of_week` function to calculate the day of the week.\n6. The result is then printed to the console.",
