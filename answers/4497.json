  "answer": "**Quiz Game Function**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python function that implements a quiz game. The function asks the user a series of questions, keeps track of their score, and provides feedback on their answers.\n\n```python\ndef quiz_game(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Play a quiz game against the user.\n\n    Args:\n        questions (list): A list of dictionaries containing the question, options, and answer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The user's final score.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for i, question in enumerate(questions):\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion {i+1}: {question['question']}\")\n        for j, option in enumerate(question['options']):\n            print(f\"{j+1}. {option}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter the number of your answer: \")\n        if question['options'][int(answer) - 1] == question['answer']:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {question['answer']}.\")\n    return score\n\n# Example usage:\nquestions = [\n    {\n        'question': 'What is the capital of France?',\n        'options': ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Rome'],\n        'answer': 'Paris'\n    },\n    {\n        'question': 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',\n        'options': ['Earth', 'Saturn', 'Jupiter', 'Uranus'],\n        'answer': 'Jupiter'\n    },\n    {\n        'question': 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',\n        'options': ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Michelangelo', 'Raphael', 'Caravaggio'],\n        'answer': 'Leonardo da Vinci'\n    }\n]\n\ndef main():\n    score = quiz_game(questions)\n    print(f\"\\nGame over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `quiz_game` function takes a list of dictionaries as input, where each dictionary represents a question with its options and answer.\n*   The function iterates over each question, prints it to the console, and asks the user to enter the number of their answer.\n*   The function checks if the user's answer is correct and updates their score accordingly.\n*   The function returns the user's final score.\n*   In the example usage, we define a list of questions and call the `quiz_game` function with this list.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `quiz_game` function and prints the user's final score.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n*   You can customize the quiz game by adding or modifying questions in the `questions` list.\n*   You can also add more features, such as keeping track of the user's progress, providing hints, or implementing a timer.",
