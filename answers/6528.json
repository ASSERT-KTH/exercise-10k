It uses a list of words to choose from, and the user has to guess the word by suggesting letters. The `display_hangman` function is used to display the current state of the hangman figure.\n\n**How to Run the Code**\n------------------------\n\nTo run the code, save it to a file (e.g., `hangman.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python hangman.py`). The game will start, and you can play by guessing letters.",
