  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the division result and the remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    division_result = dividend / divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return division_result, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        division_result, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The division result is: {division_result}\")\n        print(f\"The remainder is: {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `divide_and_remainder` that takes two arguments, `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2. **Error Handling**: We check if the `divisor` is zero to prevent a division by zero error. If it is, we raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n3. **Division and Remainder Calculation**: We calculate the division result and remainder using the `/` and `%` operators, respectively.\n4. **Return Values**: We return both the division result and the remainder as a tuple.\n5. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we take user input for the dividend and divisor, call our `divide_and_remainder` function, and print the results.\n6. **Error Handling in Main**: We use a try-except block to catch and handle any `ZeroDivisionError` that might be raised during the division.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Divide 10 by 2: Input `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor. The output will be a division result of `5.0` and a remainder of `0.0`.\n- Divide 17 by 5: Input `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor. The output will be a division result of `3.4` and a remainder of `2.0`.\n- Attempt to divide by zero: Input any number as the dividend and `0` as the divisor. The program will output an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.",
