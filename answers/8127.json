  "answer": "**Simple Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using if/else statements.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(num1, \"+\", num2, \"=\", num1 + num2)\n\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(num1, \"-\", num2, \"=\", num1 - num2)\n\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(num1, \"*\", num2, \"=\", num1 * num2)\n\n        elif choice == '4':\n            if num2 != 0:\n                print(num1, \"/\", num2, \"=\", num1 / num2)\n            else:\n                print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    again = input(\"Do you want to calculate again? (yes/no): \")\n    if again.lower() == 'yes':\n        main()\n    else:\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculator()` that displays a menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. The user is prompted to enter their choice of operation.\n3. Based on the user's choice, they are asked to input two numbers.\n4. The program uses if/else statements to perform the selected operation and display the result.\n5. If the user chooses division, the program checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n6. The `main()` function calls the `calculator()` function and asks the user if they want to calculate again.\n7. If the user chooses to calculate again, the `main()` function is called recursively.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and choose addition. Enter two numbers, e.g., 5 and 3. The program will display the result: `5 + 3 = 8.0`.\n* Run the program and choose division. Enter two numbers, e.g., 10 and 2. The program will display the result: `10 / 2 = 5.0`.\n* Run the program and choose division. Enter two numbers, e.g., 10 and 0. The program will display an error message: `Error! Division by zero is not allowed.`.",
