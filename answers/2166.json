  "answer": "**Circle Circumference Calculator**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the radius\n    while True:\n        try:\n            radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n            if radius <= 0:\n                print(\"Radius must be a positive number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the circumference\n    circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n    print(f\"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the circle when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n3. The program will print the circumference of the circle.\n\n**Note:** The circumference is calculated using the formula `C = 2 * \u03c0 * r`, where `C` is the circumference and `r` is the radius. The result is printed with two decimal places.",
