  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a coin flip using conditional statements and prints out the result (heads or tails).",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that simulates a coin flip using conditional statements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    # Generate a random number between 0 and 1\n    flip = random.random()\n\n    # If the number is less than 0.5, it's heads\n    if flip < 0.5:\n        return \"Heads\"\n    # Otherwise, it's tails\n    else:\n        return \"Tails\"\n\n# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result\nprint(coin_flip())\n```\n\nIn this program, the `random.random()` function generates a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than 0.5, the program returns \"Heads\", otherwise it returns \"Tails\". This simulates the randomness of a coin flip. \n\nYou can also use `random.randint(0, 1)` to generate a random number, where 0 represents heads and 1 represents tails. Here is how you can modify the program:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    # Generate a random number, either 0 or 1\n    flip = random.randint(0, 1)\n\n    # If the number is 0, it's heads\n    if flip == 0:\n        return \"Heads\"\n    # Otherwise, it's tails\n    else:\n        return \"Tails\"\n\n# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result\nprint(coin_flip())\n```\n\nYou can also use `random.choice()` to select between \"Heads\" and \"Tails\" directly:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    # Select between \"Heads\" and \"Tails\" randomly\n    return random.choice([\"Heads\", \"Tails\"])\n\n# Call the function to flip the coin and print the result\nprint(coin_flip())\n```\n\nThis version of the program is simpler and more straightforward. It directly selects between \"Heads\" and \"Tails\" without the need for an intermediate random number.",
