  "answer": "**Password Generation Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user for a length and generates a random password of that length.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password of the given length.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the characters that can be used in the password\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n\n    # Ensure the password has at least one character from each type\n    if length < 3:\n        password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))\n    else:\n        password = [\n            random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase),\n            random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase),\n            random.choice(string.digits)\n        ]\n        # Fill the rest of the password with random characters\n        for _ in range(length - 3):\n            password.append(random.choice(characters))\n        # Shuffle the list to ensure randomness\n        random.shuffle(password)\n\n    return ''.join(password)\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the length of the password\n    while True:\n        try:\n            length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the password: \"))\n            if length < 1:\n                print(\"Length must be a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Generate and print the password\n    password = generate_password(length)\n    print(\"Generated Password : \", password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the length of the password when prompted (e.g., 12).\n3. The program will generate and print a random password of the given length.\n\nNote: This program uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation to generate the password. It ensures that the password has at least one character from each type, if the length is 3 or more. If the length is less than 3, it will simply generate a random password using all possible characters.",
