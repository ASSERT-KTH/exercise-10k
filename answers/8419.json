  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades as input. The function should return a new dictionary with the students' names as keys and their grades as values, but only include students with grades above 80.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters a dictionary of students based on their grades, returning a new dictionary with only those who have grades above a certain threshold. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef filter_students(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades.\n    It returns a new dictionary with only the students who have grades above 80.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with students who have grades above 80.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student and their grade in the input dictionary\n    for student, grade in grades_dict.items():\n        \n        # Check if the student's grade is above 80\n        if grade > 80:\n            \n            # If the grade is above 80, add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student] = grade\n\n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_students\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"John\": 90,\n    \"Alice\": 70,\n    \"Bob\": 85,\n    \"Charlie\": 95\n}\n\nfiltered_grades = filter_students(grades)\nprint(filtered_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `filter_students` takes a dictionary `grades_dict` as input, where keys are student names and values are their grades.\n* It iterates over each student and their grade in the input dictionary using a `for` loop, checking if the grade is above 80. If it is, the student is added to the `filtered_students` dictionary.\n* The function returns the `filtered_students` dictionary, which contains only the students with grades above 80.\n* In the example usage, a dictionary `grades` is created with sample student names and grades, and then passed to the `filter_students` function to demonstrate its functionality.",
