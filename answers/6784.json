  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, then back down to 1. Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and a while loop to print the numbers from 10 back down to 1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop\ni = 10\nwhile i > 0:\n    print(i)\n    i = i - 1\n```\nThis code first uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses a `while` loop to print the numbers from 10 back down to 1. The output will be:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```",
