  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input. The input can be either an integer, a float, or a string. The program should then print out the data type of the input.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Current Date]\n# Description: This program takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input.\n# Note: The input can be either an integer, a float, or a string.\n\nuser_input = input(\"Enter a value: \")\n\nif user_input.isdigit():\n    print(\"The data type of the input is: integer\")\nelif user_input.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():\n    print(\"The data type of the input is: float\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The data type of the input is: string\")\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they would typically be filled in by the person writing the code. Also, I've used the `replace` function to remove at most one decimal point from the input string, as specified in the requirements.",
