  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user to input their name and age, stores the name as a string and the age as an integer, then prints out a greeting message with the name and age. The program should also convert the age to a float and print out the age with two decimal places.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Input and Output\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nage = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n\n# Printing\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\nfloat_age = float(age)\nprint(f\"You are {float_age:.2f} years old.\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It asks the user for their name and age using `input()` functions.\n2. It stores the input values in the `name` and `age` variables, converting the age to an integer using `int()`.\n3. It prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age using an f-string.\n4. It converts the age to a floating-point number using `float()` and stores it in `float_age`.\n5. It prints out the age with two decimal places using an f-string with the `:.2f` format specifier.\n\nNote that this code does not include any error handling or validation, so it assumes that the user will enter a valid name and age. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to handle invalid input.",
