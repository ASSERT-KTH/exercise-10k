  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input and then validates the age. If the age is less than 18, print 'You are a minor.' If the age is 18 or above, print 'You are an adult.' Then, echo back the user's name and age. Ensure that the age is a positive integer.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef validate_age():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a user's name and age as input, validates the age,\n    and then prints out whether the user is a minor or an adult.\n    It also echoes back the user's name and age.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Take user's name as input\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    \n    # Take user's age as input and validate it\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age <= 0:\n                print(\"Age must be a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Age must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    # Validate the age and print whether the user is a minor or an adult\n    if age < 18:\n        print('You are a minor.')\n    else:\n        print('You are an adult.')\n    \n    # Echo back the user's name and age\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\n# Call the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    validate_age()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The program starts by taking the user's name as input using the built-in `input()` function in Python.\n- Then, it takes the user's age as input and validates it using a `while` loop. The loop continues to prompt the user for input until a positive integer is entered.\n- The `try-except` block is used to catch `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the input cannot be converted to an integer.\n- Once the age is validated, the program checks whether the age is less than 18 and prints out whether the user is a minor or an adult.\n- Finally, the program echoes back the user's name and age using an f-string.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- If the user enters a name and a valid age (e.g., 25), the program will print 'You are an adult.' and then echo back the user's name and age.\n- If the user enters a name and an invalid age (e.g., -1 or 'abc'), the program will prompt the user to enter a positive integer until a valid age is entered.\n- If the user enters a name and an age less than 18 (e.g., 17), the program will print 'You are a minor.' and then echo back the user's name and age.",
