  "prompt": "Create a program that predicts the weather forecast based on user input, using conditional statements to determine the forecast rules",
  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses conditional statements to predict the weather forecast based on user input. The forecast rules are as follows:\n\n* If the temperature is above 25\u00b0C, the forecast is \"Hot\".\n* If the temperature is between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, the forecast is \"Mild\".\n* If the temperature is between 5\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C, the forecast is \"Cool\".\n* If the temperature is below 5\u00b0C, the forecast is \"Cold\".\n* If it is raining, the forecast is \"Rainy\".\n* If the humidity is above 60%, the forecast is \"Humid\".\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef get_weather_forecast(temperature, raining, humidity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the weather forecast based on user input.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n        raining (bool): Whether it is raining or not.\n        humidity (float): The current humidity percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The predicted weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if raining:\n        return \"Rainy\"\n    elif temperature > 25:\n        return \"Hot\"\n    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:\n        return \"Mild\"\n    elif 5 <= temperature < 15:\n        return \"Cool\"\n    elif temperature < 5:\n        return \"Cold\"\n    elif humidity > 60:\n        return \"Humid\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown\"\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    raining = input(\"Is it raining? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n    humidity = float(input(\"Enter the current humidity percentage: \"))\n\n    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature, raining, humidity)\n    print(f\"The predicted weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Hot weather**: Enter a temperature above 25\u00b0C, and the forecast will be \"Hot\".\n2. **Rainy weather**: Enter \"yes\" for raining, and the forecast will be \"Rainy\".\n3. **Humid weather**: Enter a humidity above 60%, and the forecast will be \"Humid\".\n4. **Mild weather**: Enter a temperature between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, and the forecast will be \"Mild\".\n5. **Cool weather**: Enter a temperature between 5\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C, and the forecast will be \"Cool\".\n6. **Cold weather**: Enter a temperature below 5\u00b0C, and the forecast will be \"Cold\".\n\n**Note**: This program uses a simple set of rules to predict the weather forecast. In a real-world application, you would likely use more complex algorithms and data sources to make accurate predictions.",
