  "prompt": "Create binary literals and print their values.",
  "answer": "### Binary Literals in Python\nPython supports binary literals, which can be created using the `0b` prefix.\n\n#### Code\n```python\n# Create binary literals\nbinary_literal1 = 0b1010\nbinary_literal2 = 0b1101\n\n# Print their values\nprint(\"Binary Literal 1:\", binary_literal1)\nprint(\"Binary Literal 2:\", binary_literal2)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `0b` prefix is used to denote a binary literal.\n*   `binary_literal1` and `binary_literal2` are created with the binary values `1010` and `1101`, respectively.\n*   The `print` statements are used to display the decimal values of these binary literals.\n\n#### Output\nWhen you run this code, it will print the decimal values of the binary literals:\n```\nBinary Literal 1: 10\nBinary Literal 2: 13\n```\n\nTo verify the conversion, you can use the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal values back to binary:\n```python\nprint(\"Binary Representation of Binary Literal 1:\", bin(binary_literal1))\nprint(\"Binary Representation of Binary Literal 2:\", bin(binary_literal2))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nBinary Representation of Binary Literal 1: 0b1010\nBinary Representation of Binary Literal 2: 0b1101\n```\n\nThis confirms that the binary literals were correctly created and printed.",
