  "answer": "**Reading an Integer and Printing its Double**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that reads an integer from the user and prints out its double.\n\n```python\ndef print_double():\n    # Read an integer from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = int(input(\"Please enter an integer: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid integer. Please try again.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the double\n    double_num = num * 2\n    print(\"The double of\", num, \"is\", double_num)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_double()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `print_double` function prompts the user to enter an integer.\n2. It uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid inputs. If the input can't be converted to an integer, it prints an error message and asks for input again.\n3. Once a valid integer is entered, it calculates the double by multiplying the number by 2.\n4. Finally, it prints out the double.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nPlease enter an integer: 5\nThe double of 5 is 10\n```",
