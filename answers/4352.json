The tax brackets are defined as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the upper limit of the bracket and the corresponding tax rate.\n\nThe function iterates over the tax brackets, calculates the taxable amount for each bracket, and adds the tax for that bracket to the total tax. If the income is less than or equal to the current bracket, the function breaks out of the loop.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the program demonstrates how to use the `calculate_tax` function to calculate the tax on an income of $1500.",
