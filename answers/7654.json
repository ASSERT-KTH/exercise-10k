  "answer": "**Vector Norm Calculation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the norm (also known as the magnitude or length) of a vector. The norm is a measure of the size of a vector and is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_vector_norm(vector):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the norm of a vector.\n\n    Args:\n        vector (list): A list of numbers representing the components of the vector.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The norm of the vector.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in vector))\n\n# Example usage:\nvector = [3, 4]\nnorm = calculate_vector_norm(vector)\nprint(f\"The norm of the vector {vector} is {norm}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_vector_norm` takes a list of numbers `vector` as input.\n*   It calculates the norm using the formula `sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in vector))`, where `x**2` squares each component and `sum` adds up these squares.\n*   The `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root.\n*   The result is returned as a float.\n\n### Alternative Implementation (Using NumPy)\n\nIf you are working with large vectors or need to perform other vector operations, consider using the NumPy library, which provides an efficient and convenient way to work with vectors and matrices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_vector_norm(vector):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the norm of a vector using NumPy.\n\n    Args:\n        vector (list): A list of numbers representing the components of the vector.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The norm of the vector.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.linalg.norm(vector)\n\n# Example usage:\nvector = [3, 4]\nnorm = calculate_vector_norm(vector)\nprint(f\"The norm of the vector {vector} is {norm}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `np.linalg.norm` function from NumPy, which calculates the norm of a vector.",
