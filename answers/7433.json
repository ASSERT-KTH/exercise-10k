  "prompt": "Create a function that finds the index of a given element in an array. If the element is not found, return -1. The function should handle arrays with duplicate elements and elements that do not exist in the array.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that finds the index of a given element in an array, handling cases where the element is not found or appears multiple times. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of a given element in an array.\n    \n    If the element is not found, it returns -1. The function can handle arrays with duplicate elements and elements that do not exist in the array.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array (list): The list of elements to search in.\n    target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(array, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Try to find the index of the target element in the array\n    try:\n        # Use the index method of the list to find the index of the target element\n        # This method raises a ValueError if the target element is not found\n        index = array.index(target)\n        \n        # If the target element is found, return its index\n        return index\n    \n    # If the target element is not found, the index method raises a ValueError\n    except ValueError:\n        # In this case, return -1 as specified in the problem statement\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_index` takes two parameters: `array` and `target`, where `array` is the list of elements to search in and `target` is the element to search for.\n* It first checks if the input `array` is indeed a list, raising a `TypeError` if not.\n* The function then attempts to find the index of the `target` element in the `array` using the `index` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the `target` is not found.\n* If the `target` is found, its index is returned; otherwise, the function catches the `ValueError` and returns -1 as per the problem statement.",
