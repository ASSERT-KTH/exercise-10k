  "answer": "**Variable Scope Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the concept of variable scope in programming. It shows how variables can be defined and accessed within different scopes, such as local, global, and nonlocal.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Global scope\nx = 10  # global variable\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing scope\n    y = 20  # nonlocal variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local scope\n        z = 30  # local variable\n        print(\"Inner function:\")\n        print(\"x (global):\", x)\n        print(\"y (nonlocal):\", y)\n        print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Outer function:\")\n    print(\"x (global):\", x)\n    print(\"y (nonlocal):\", y)\n    # print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise a NameError\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global scope:\")\nprint(\"x (global):\", x)\n# print(\"y (nonlocal):\", y)  # This would raise a NameError\n# print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise a NameError\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We define a global variable `x` with the value `10`.\n2.  We define an `outer_function` that has access to the global variable `x`.\n3.  Within `outer_function`, we define a nonlocal variable `y` with the value `20`.\n4.  We define an `inner_function` within `outer_function`. This `inner_function` has access to the global variable `x`, the nonlocal variable `y`, and its own local variable `z`.\n5.  We print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` from within `inner_function` to demonstrate that it can access variables from its local scope, the enclosing scope, and the global scope.\n6.  We then print the values of `x` and `y` from within `outer_function` to show that it can access the global variable `x` and its own nonlocal variable `y`. However, it cannot access the local variable `z` from `inner_function`.\n7.  Finally, we print the value of `x` from the global scope to demonstrate that it can be accessed from anywhere in the program. However, the nonlocal variable `y` and the local variable `z` are not accessible from the global scope.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nInner function:\nx (global): 10\ny (nonlocal): 20\nz (local): 30\nOuter function:\nx (global): 10\ny (nonlocal): 20\nGlobal scope:\nx (global): 10\n```\n\nThis program illustrates the concept of variable scope in programming, demonstrating how variables can be defined and accessed within different scopes.",
