  "answer": "**Image Resizer Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program takes in the image width and height, resizes the image while maintaining the aspect ratio, and prints out the resized image dimensions along with its orientation.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef resize_image(width, height, max_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"\n    Resizes an image while maintaining its aspect ratio.\n\n    Args:\n        width (int): The original width of the image.\n        height (int): The original height of the image.\n        max_size (int, optional): The maximum size of the resized image. Defaults to 1024.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The resized width and height of the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the aspect ratio\n    aspect_ratio = width / height\n\n    # If the width is greater than the height, the image is in landscape mode\n    orientation = \"Landscape\" if width > height else \"Portrait\"\n\n    # Resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio\n    if width > height:\n        new_width = max_size\n        new_height = int(max_size / aspect_ratio)\n    else:\n        new_width = int(max_size * aspect_ratio)\n        new_height = max_size\n\n    return new_width, new_height, orientation\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the image width and height from the user\n    width = int(input(\"Enter the image width: \"))\n    height = int(input(\"Enter the image height: \"))\n\n    # Resize the image and print the results\n    new_width, new_height, orientation = resize_image(width, height)\n    print(f\"Resized Image Dimensions: {new_width}x{new_height}\")\n    print(f\"Image Orientation: {orientation}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the image width and height when prompted.\n3. The program will print out the resized image dimensions and its orientation.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the image width: 2048\nEnter the image height: 1024\nResized Image Dimensions: 1024x512\nImage Orientation: Landscape\n```\n\nNote: This program resizes the image to a maximum size of 1024 pixels, maintaining the aspect ratio. You can adjust the `max_size` parameter to change the maximum size.",
