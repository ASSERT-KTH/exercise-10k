  "answer": "**Number Sum Program**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a while loop to sum all the numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sums all the numbers from 1 to n using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        total += i\n        i += 1\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    n = 10\n    result = sum_numbers(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes two variables: `total` to store the sum and `i` to iterate from 1 to `n`.\n2. The while loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n3. Inside the loop, `i` is added to `total` and then incremented by 1.\n4. Once the loop finishes, the function returns the total sum.\n5. In the `main` function, we call `sum_numbers` with `n = 10` and print the result.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55\n```\n\nYou can run this program to see the result. The output will be the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10, which is 55.",
