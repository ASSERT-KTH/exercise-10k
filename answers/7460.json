  "prompt": "Create a program that defines a set of functions to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take two numbers and an operation as input and return the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Arithmetic Operations Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {sub(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {mul(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {div(num1, num2)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n# Define the arithmetic operations functions\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef sub(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef mul(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef div(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return None\n    return x / y\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code matches the specifications and provides a simple arithmetic operations program that takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation.",
