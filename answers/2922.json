  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate the input.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess the number: \"))\n            return guess\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random number and repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly.\"\"\"\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Get the user's guess\n        guess = get_user_guess()\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_guess` function is used to get the user's guess and validate the input. It ensures that the user enters a whole number.\n* In the `main` function, a random number is generated between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n* A while loop is used to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly.\n* After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\" to help the user narrow down their next guess.\n* Once the user guesses the number correctly, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n* The program will guide you through the game, providing feedback after each guess.\n* Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible to win the game.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator and does not store any user data. It is designed for entertainment purposes only.",
