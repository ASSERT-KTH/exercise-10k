  "answer": "### Filtering a List of Numbers\n#### Function Overview\n\nThe following Python function, `filter_numbers`, takes a list of numbers and a condition as input. It uses the built-in `filter()` function to filter the list based on the given condition.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef filter_numbers(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number as input and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(filter(condition, numbers))\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a condition function that checks if a number is even\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\n# Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Filter the list of numbers based on the condition\nfiltered_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)\n\nprint(filtered_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `filter_numbers` function takes two arguments: `numbers` (a list of numbers) and `condition` (a function that takes a number as input and returns a boolean value).\n2. The `filter()` function is used to filter the `numbers` list based on the `condition` function.\n3. The `filter()` function returns a filter object, which is then converted to a list using the `list()` function.\n4. The filtered list of numbers is returned by the `filter_numbers` function.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n* Filter a list of numbers to get only the even numbers: `filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)`\n* Filter a list of numbers to get only the numbers greater than 5: `filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)`\n* Filter a list of numbers to get only the numbers that are divisible by 3: `filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 3 == 0)`",
