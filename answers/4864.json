  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses nested loops to print a square pattern of asterisks:\n\n```python\ndef print_square(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a square pattern of asterisks with the specified size.\n\n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the square.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Loop through each row in the square\n    for i in range(size):\n        # Loop through each column in the row\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Print an asterisk\n            print(\"* \", end=\"\")\n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_square(5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function called `print_square` that takes one argument `size`, which specifies the size of the square pattern. It uses two nested loops to iterate through each row and column in the square.\n\n*   The outer loop (`for i in range(size)`) iterates through each row in the square.\n*   The inner loop (`for j in range(size)`) iterates through each column in the current row and prints an asterisk (`*`) followed by a space.\n*   After each row is printed, the program moves to the next line using `print()`.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run `print_square(5)`, it will print the following square pattern of asterisks:\n\n```\n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n```\n\nYou can adjust the size of the square by passing a different value to the `print_square` function.",
