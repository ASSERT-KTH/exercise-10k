  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds the maximum value in a list of numbers by iterating over the list and keeping track of the maximum value found so far. This function will help you understand how to process a list and compare values to determine the maximum. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_value(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list.\n    \n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        max_val: The maximum value in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, we raise a ValueError because we can't find the maximum value of an empty list.\n    if not num_list:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    # We initialize the max_val variable with the first element of the list. This will be our initial guess for the maximum value.\n    # The reason we start with the first element is that we need to start the comparison from somewhere, and the first element is as good as any other.\n    max_val = num_list[0]\n\n    # Now, we iterate over the rest of the list. We start from the second element (index 1) because we've already considered the first element.\n    for num in num_list[1:]:\n        # Inside the loop, we check if the current number is greater than our current max_val.\n        # If it is, we update max_val to be the current number. This way, max_val will always hold the maximum value we've seen so far.\n        if num > max_val:\n            max_val = num\n\n    # After the loop finishes, max_val will hold the maximum value in the list. We return this value.\n    return max_val\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_max_value` starts by checking if the input list `num_list` is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised because the maximum value of an empty list cannot be determined.\n* The `max_val` variable is initialized with the first element of `num_list`. This serves as the initial guess for the maximum value, providing a starting point for comparisons.\n* The function then iterates over the rest of `num_list`, starting from the second element. Inside the loop, each number `num` is compared to the current `max_val`. If `num` is greater, `max_val` is updated to `num`, ensuring that `max_val` always holds the maximum value encountered so far.\n* After iterating over the entire list, `max_val` will hold the maximum value in `num_list`, which is then returned by the function.",
