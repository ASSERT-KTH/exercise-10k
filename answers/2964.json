  "prompt": "Create a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The program should generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and ask the user for their choice. The program should then determine the winner based on the game's rules.",

(y/n): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe provided Python solution allows users to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n*   The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n*   The `get_user_choice` function prompts the user to enter their choice and validates it to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n*   The `determine_winner` function compares the computer's choice and the user's choice to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n*   The `main` function serves as the program's entry point. It contains a loop that continues to prompt the user for input and play the game until the user chooses to stop.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Run the program and enter your choice when prompted.\n*   The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n*   You can choose to play again by entering 'y' when prompted.\n\nTo run this code, save it to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`).",
