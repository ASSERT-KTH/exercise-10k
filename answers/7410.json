  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) Problem**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef length_of_lis(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize the dp array with 1s, since a single element is always an increasing subsequence\n    dp = [1] * len(nums)\n\n    # Iterate over the array and update the dp array\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If the current element is greater than the previous element, update the dp array\n            if nums[i] > nums[j]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n\n    # Return the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return max(dp)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\nprint(\"Length of LIS:\", length_of_lis(nums))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We initialize the `dp` array with 1s, since a single element is always an increasing subsequence.\n*   We iterate over the array and for each element, we check all previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element, we update the `dp` array with the maximum of the current value and the value of the previous element plus one.\n*   Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we have two nested loops that iterate over the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we need to store the `dp` array, which has the same length as the input array.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   `length_of_lis([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80])` returns `6`, since the longest increasing subsequence is `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80]`.\n*   `length_of_lis([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `5`, since the longest increasing subsequence is the entire array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n*   `length_of_lis([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])` returns `1`, since the longest increasing subsequence is a single element `[5]`.",
