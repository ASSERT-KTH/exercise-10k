The program starts by loading the English words dataset from NLTK.\n2. The `generate_suggestions` function takes a word as input and generates a list of spelling suggestions.\n3. It first uses the `get_close_matches` function from `difflib` to find close matches from the English words dataset.\n4. If no close matches are found, it uses edit distance to find similar words.\n5. The `main` function takes a word as input from the user, generates the spelling suggestions, and prints them.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Enter a word with a typo, such as \"teh\" or \"accomodate\", to see spelling suggestions.\n* Enter a word with a non-standard spelling, such as \"colour\" or \"centre\", to see suggestions for the standard spelling.\n* Enter a word that is not in the English words dataset, such as a proper noun or a word from a different language, to see suggestions for similar words.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple approach to generate spelling suggestions and may not always produce accurate results. For more accurate results, you may want to use a more advanced NLP library or a machine learning model trained on a large dataset.",
