  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and outputs its absolute value.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes an integer as input and outputs its absolute value:\n\n```python\n# Take an integer as input\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n\n# Calculate the absolute value\nabs_num = abs(num)\n\n# Print the absolute value\nprint(\"The absolute value is:\", abs_num)\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It prompts the user to enter an integer using the `input` function.\n2. The input is converted to an integer using the `int` function.\n3. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the input integer.\n4. The absolute value is then printed to the console.\n\nYou can also write this program in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\nprint(\"The absolute value is:\", abs(num))\n```\n\nThis version of the program does the same thing as the previous one, but in fewer lines of code.",
