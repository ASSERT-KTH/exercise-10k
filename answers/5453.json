  "answer": "**Email Extractor Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and prints out all the email addresses found in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_emails(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts email addresses from a given input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to extract email addresses from.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of extracted email addresses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Regular expression pattern to match email addresses\n    email_pattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n\n    # Find all email addresses in the input string\n    emails = re.findall(email_pattern, input_string)\n\n    return emails\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"Contact me at john.doe@example.com or jane.smith@example.org for more information.\"\n    emails = extract_emails(input_string)\n\n    print(\"Extracted Email Addresses:\")\n    for email in emails:\n        print(email)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `extract_emails` function takes an input string and uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses.\n2. The regular expression pattern `r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'` matches most common email address formats.\n3. The `re.findall` function finds all occurrences of the email pattern in the input string and returns them as a list.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `extract_emails` function.\n5. The extracted email addresses are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nExtracted Email Addresses:\njohn.doe@example.com\njane.smith@example.org\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple regular expression pattern to match email addresses. You may need to adjust the pattern to fit your specific use case.\n* This program does not validate the extracted email addresses. You may want to add additional validation or verification steps depending on your requirements.",
