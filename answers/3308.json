  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a target element as input, and returns the index of the target element in the array if it exists, or -1 if it does not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint search(int nums[], int numsSize, int target) {\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = numsSize - 1;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (nums[mid] == target) {\n            return mid;\n        } else if (nums[mid] > target) {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        } else {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\n    int target = 5;\n    int result = search(nums, sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]), target);\n    cout << \"Target element found at index: \" << result << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that I've used the `sizeof` operator to calculate the size of the `nums` array in the `main` function, as specified in the requirements. I've also included the `using namespace std;` directive to allow for the use of standard library functions without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix.",
