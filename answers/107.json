The `bubble_sort` function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.\n2.  The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the array.\n3.  The inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n4.  If no swaps are made during an iteration, the array is already sorted, and the function terminates early.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\n*   Best-case: O(n) when the input array is already sorted.\n*   Average-case: O(n^2) for random input arrays.\n*   Worst-case: O(n^2) when the input array is reverse-sorted.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\n*   O(1) because Bubble Sort only uses a constant amount of additional space for variables.",
