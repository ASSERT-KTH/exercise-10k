  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that checks if a given number is prime, implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    max_divisor = int(n**0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers_to_check = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers_to_check:\n        print(f\"Is {num} prime? {is_prime(num)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is prime.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1 (not prime) or if `n` is 2 (the only even prime number).\n3. If `n` is even and not 2, it's not prime.\n4. It then checks odd divisors up to the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than that would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n5. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(\u221an)\n\n**Note:** This implementation is efficient for checking primality of numbers within a reasonable range. For very large numbers, more advanced primality tests like the Miller-Rabin test may be necessary.",
