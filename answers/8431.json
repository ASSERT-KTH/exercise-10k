  "answer": "**Conditional Loop Control Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of conditional statements to control a loop. It simulates a simple banking system where a user can deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000 balance\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n2. The `main` function initializes a `BankAccount` object with an initial balance of $1000.\n3. The program enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input until they choose to exit.\n4. Based on the user's input, the program uses conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to determine which action to take.\n5. If the user chooses to deposit or withdraw, they are prompted to enter the amount, and the corresponding method is called on the `BankAccount` object.\n6. If the user chooses to check their balance, the `check_balance` method is called.\n7. If the user chooses to exit, the program breaks out of the loop and ends.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Deposit $500: Choose option 1, enter 500 as the amount to deposit.\n* Withdraw $200: Choose option 2, enter 200 as the amount to withdraw.\n* Check balance: Choose option 3.\n* Exit program: Choose option 4.",
