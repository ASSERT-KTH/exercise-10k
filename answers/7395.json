  "prompt": "Create a program that processes a dictionary containing student information. The dictionary should have student names as keys and another dictionary as values. The inner dictionary should contain the keys 'grades' and 'attendance'. The program should calculate the average grade for each student, and then print out the student's name, average grade, and attendance. If a student has an average grade above 90, mark them as 'Excellent', between 80 and 90 as 'Good', between 70 and 80 as 'Fair', and below 70 as 'Needs Improvement'.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef process_student_info(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Process a dictionary containing student information.\n\n    Args:\n        student_info (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and another dictionary as values.\n            The inner dictionary should contain the keys 'grades' and 'attendance'.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for student, info in student_info.items():\n        # Calculate the average grade\n        average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])\n\n        # Determine the grade status\n        if average_grade >= 90:\n            grade_status = 'Excellent'\n        elif average_grade >= 80:\n            grade_status = 'Good'\n        elif average_grade >= 70:\n            grade_status = 'Fair'\n        else:\n            grade_status = 'Needs Improvement'\n\n        # Print out the student's information\n        print(f\"Student Name: {student}\")\n        print(f\"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Attendance: {info['attendance']}%\")\n        print(f\"Grade Status: {grade_status}\")\n        print(\"------------------------\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\nstudent_info = {\n    \"John Doe\": {\n        \"grades\": [85, 90, 78, 92, 88],\n        \"attendance\": 95\n    },\n    \"Jane Doe\": {\n        \"grades\": [70, 75, 80, 85, 90],\n        \"attendance\": 90\n    },\n    \"Bob Smith\": {\n        \"grades\": [60, 65, 70, 75, 80],\n        \"attendance\": 85\n    }\n}\n\nprocess_student_info(student_info)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `process_student_info` that takes a dictionary `student_info` as input. It iterates over each student in the dictionary, calculates the average grade, determines the grade status based on the average grade, and prints out the student's information.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `process_student_info` function with a sample `student_info` dictionary. You can modify the `student_info` dictionary to include your own student data.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the 'grades' list in the inner dictionary is not empty. If there's a possibility that the 'grades' list could be empty, you should add error handling to avoid division by zero errors.",
