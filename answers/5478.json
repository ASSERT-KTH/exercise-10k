  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a condition as input and partitions the array into two parts: elements that satisfy the condition and elements that do not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nfunction partition<T>(arr: T[], condition: (arg: T) => boolean): [T[], T[]] {\n  return arr.reduce(\n    ([left, right], current) => {\n      if (condition(current)) {\n        left.push(current);\n      } else {\n        right.push(current);\n      }\n      return [left, right];\n    },\n    [[], []]\n  );\n}\n\n// Test the function\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst condition = (n: number) => n % 2 === 0;\nconst [even, odd] = partition(arr, condition);\nconsole.log(even); // [2, 4]\nconsole.log(odd); // [1, 3, 5]\n```\nThis code defines the `partition` function, which takes an array `arr` and a condition function `condition` as input, and returns a tuple containing two arrays: one with elements that satisfy the condition, and one with elements that do not. The function uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the input array and apply the condition to each element. The `condition` function is called with the current element as an argument, and the result is used to determine whether to add the element to the left or right array. The function returns a tuple containing the two arrays, which are initialized as empty arrays in the `reduce` method. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `partition` function to partition an array of numbers into even and odd numbers.",
