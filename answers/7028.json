  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The program should then call these functions with the length and width of the rectangle as arguments and print the results.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n\n```python\ndef area(l, b):\n    area = l * b\n    return area\n\ndef perimeter(l, b):\n    perimeter = 2 * (l + b)\n    return perimeter\n\nl = 5\nb = 4\nprint(\"Perimeter:\", perimeter(l, b))\nprint(\"Area:\", area(l, b))\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions, `area` and `perimeter`, which calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, respectively. The `area` function multiplies the length and breadth of the rectangle, while the `perimeter` function calculates the perimeter using the formula `2 * (l + b)`. The code then sets the length and breadth of the rectangle to 5 and 4, respectively, and prints the perimeter and area of the rectangle by calling the `perimeter` and `area` functions.",
