  "answer": "**List Intersection Program**\n================================\n\nThis program finds the intersection of two or more lists, returning a new list containing only the elements that are common to all input lists.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(*lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two or more lists.\n\n    Args:\n        *lists: Variable number of lists to find the intersection of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list containing only the elements that are common to all input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lists:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize the intersection with the first list\n    intersection = set(lists[0])\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining lists and update the intersection\n    for lst in lists[1:]:\n        intersection &= set(lst)\n\n    return list(intersection)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    list3 = [3, 4, 5, 9, 10]\n\n    intersection = list_intersection(list1, list2, list3)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n\n    # Output:\n    # Intersection: [4, 5]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1.  The `list_intersection` function takes a variable number of lists as input using the `*lists` syntax.\n2.  It checks if any lists are provided and returns an empty list if not.\n3.  The intersection is initialized with the first list converted to a set for efficient lookups.\n4.  The function then iterates over the remaining lists, updating the intersection by performing a set intersection (`&=`) with each list.\n5.  Finally, the function returns the intersection as a list.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Finding common elements between two or more lists.\n*   Identifying overlapping data between different datasets.\n*   Computing the intersection of multiple sets in a mathematical context.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input lists do not contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are present and you want to preserve their counts in the intersection, you may need to use a different approach, such as using `collections.Counter` objects instead of sets.",
