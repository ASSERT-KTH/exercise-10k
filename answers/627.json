  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space given their coordinates.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x1, y1, z1=None, x2=None, y2=None, z2=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.\n    y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.\n    z1 (float, optional): The z-coordinate of the first point. Defaults to None.\n    x2 (float, optional): The x-coordinate of the second point. Defaults to None.\n    y2 (float, optional): The y-coordinate of the second point. Defaults to None.\n    z2 (float, optional): The z-coordinate of the second point. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if z1 is None and z2 is None:\n        # 2D distance calculation\n        distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n    else:\n        # 3D distance calculation\n        distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2 + (z2 - z1)**2)\n\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Distance Calculator\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points\n    x1 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n    y1 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n\n    x2 = float(input(\"Enter the x-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n    y2 = float(input(\"Enter the y-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n    # Ask if the points are in 3D space\n    is_3d = input(\"Are the points in 3D space? (yes/no): \")\n\n    if is_3d.lower() == \"yes\":\n        z1 = float(input(\"Enter the z-coordinate of the first point: \"))\n        z2 = float(input(\"Enter the z-coordinate of the second point: \"))\n\n        distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)\n    else:\n        distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2=x2, y2=y2)\n\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter the coordinates of the two points.\n2. If the points are in 3D space, enter the z-coordinates.\n3. The program will calculate and display the distance between the two points.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between two points.\n* The program can calculate distances in both 2D and 3D spaces.\n* The user is prompted to enter the coordinates of the two points and whether the points are in 3D space.",
