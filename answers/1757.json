  "answer": "**Union of Two Lists**\n=======================\n\nThe union of two lists is a list that contains all unique elements from both lists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef union_of_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two lists.\n    \n    :param list1: The first list of integers.\n    :param list2: The second list of integers.\n    :return: A list containing all unique elements from both lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1 + list2))\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nunion = union_of_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Union:\", union)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `union_of_lists` function takes two lists of integers as input.\n2. It combines the two lists into one using the `+` operator.\n3. It converts the combined list into a set using the `set()` function, which automatically removes any duplicate elements.\n4. It converts the set back into a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The resulting list is returned as the union of the two input lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote: The order of elements in the union list may not be the same as their original order in the input lists, since sets are unordered in Python. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef union_of_lists_ordered(list1, list2):\n    seen = set()\n    union = []\n    for elem in list1 + list2:\n        if elem not in seen:\n            union.append(elem)\n            seen.add(elem)\n    return union\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nunion = union_of_lists_ordered(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Union:\", union)\n```\n\nThis version of the function preserves the original order of elements in the union list.",
