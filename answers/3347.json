  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- We define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n- We initialize a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the numbers in the list.\n- We use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list. In each iteration, we add the current number to `total`.\n- After the loop finishes, we calculate the average by dividing `total` by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements in the list).\n- We call the `calculate_average` function with a sample list of numbers and print the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe average is: 3.0\n```\n\nThis means that the average of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 3.0.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when it tries to calculate the average. To handle this case, you could add a simple check at the beginning of the `calculate_average` function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return 0  # or some other suitable value\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n```",
