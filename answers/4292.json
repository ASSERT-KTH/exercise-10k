  "answer": "### Dictionary Intersection Function\n#### Overview\nThe following function finds the intersection between two dictionaries. It returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs that are common to both input dictionaries.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing key-value pairs common to both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use dictionary comprehension to find common key-value pairs\n    intersection = {key: value for key, value in dict1.items() if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value}\n    return intersection\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n    dict2 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 3, \"d\": 4}\n\n    intersection = dict_intersection(dict1, dict2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The function `dict_intersection` takes two dictionaries, `dict1` and `dict2`, as input.\n*   It uses dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing key-value pairs that are present in both `dict1` and `dict2`.\n*   The condition `key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value` ensures that only key-value pairs with matching keys and values are included in the intersection.\n*   The function returns the resulting intersection dictionary.\n\n#### Example Output\nWhen you run the example usage, it will output:\n```\nIntersection: {'a': 1}\n```\nThis indicates that the only key-value pair common to both `dict1` and `dict2` is `{\"a\": 1}`.",
