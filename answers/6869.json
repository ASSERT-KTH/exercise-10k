  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements at even indices, as well as the sum of all elements at odd indices. The program should then print these two sums.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef sumOddEven(arr):\n    even = sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 == 0)\n    odd = sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 != 0)\n    return (even, odd)\n\n# Test the function\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven, odd = sumOddEven(arr)\nprint(\"Sum of even indices:\", even)\nprint(\"Sum of odd indices:\", odd)\n```\nNote that I used Python as the programming language, but the logic and syntax should be similar in other languages. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
