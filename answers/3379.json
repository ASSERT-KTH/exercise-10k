  "answer": "### Finding the Longest Substring without Repeating Characters\n\nHere's a Python solution using a for loop to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. This solution utilizes a sliding window approach along with a set to track unique characters in the current substring.\n\n#### Code:\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_set = set()\n\n    left = 0  # Left pointer of the sliding window\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        # Move the right pointer to the right\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            # If the character is already in the set, remove the leftmost character\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right\n\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n\n        # Update the maximum length and substring if the current window is larger\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    string = \"abcabcbb\"\n    print(f\"Longest substring without repeating characters: {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string)}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n*   The function `longest_substring_without_repeating_characters` takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.\n*   It uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` is the left pointer and `right` is the right pointer.\n*   A set `char_set` is used to store unique characters in the current substring.\n*   The function iterates through the string using the `right` pointer and expands the window to the right.\n*   If a repeating character is found, it shrinks the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer until the repeating character is removed from the set.\n*   The maximum length and substring are updated whenever a longer substring without repeating characters is found.\n\n#### Time Complexity:\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because each character is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).\n\n#### Space Complexity:\n\n*   The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, because in the worst case, the set will store all unique characters in the string.",
