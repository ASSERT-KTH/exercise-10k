Run the program and choose option 1 to add a student. Enter the student's name and grade.\n2.  Choose option 2 to calculate the average grade of all students.\n3.  Choose option 3 to get the student with the highest grade.\n4.  Choose option 4 to display all student grades.\n5.  Choose option 5 to exit the program.",
