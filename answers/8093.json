  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    string (str): The input string.\n    char (str): The character to be searched in the string.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of times the character appears in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\ndef main():\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n    if len(char) != 1:\n        print(\"Please enter a single character.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `count_char` that uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings to count the occurrences of a character in a string. The `main` function takes user input for the string and character, checks if the input character is a single character, and then calls `count_char` to get the count. If the input character is not a single character, it displays an error message.",
