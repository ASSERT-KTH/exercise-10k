  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the surface area of a rectangular prism given its length, width, and height.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_surface_area(length, width, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangular prism.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangular prism.\n        height (float): The height of the rectangular prism.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the rectangular prism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the surface area\n    surface_area = 2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height)\n\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dimensions from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the surface area\n    surface_area = calculate_surface_area(length, width, height)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The surface area of the rectangular prism is: {surface_area:.2f} square units\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_surface_area` function takes in three parameters: `length`, `width`, and `height`, which represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism.\n* The surface area of a rectangular prism is calculated using the formula `2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height)`.\n* In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the dimensions of the rectangular prism.\n* The `calculate_surface_area` function is then called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the dimensions of the rectangular prism when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the length: 5\nEnter the width: 3\nEnter the height: 2\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is: 62.00 square units\n```",
