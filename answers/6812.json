  "prompt": "Write a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (integer, float, string, boolean) and then prints out their values and data types. Ensure the variables are named appropriately to reflect their contents.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code based on the specification:\n\n```python\n# Declare and initialize variables\nstudent_id = 1\nstudent_gpa = 3.8\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nis_enrolled = True\n\n# Print variables and their data types\nprint(\"Student ID:\", student_id, type(student_id))\nprint(\"Student GPA:\", student_gpa, type(student_gpa))\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name, type(student_name))\nprint(\"Is Enrolled:\", is_enrolled, type(is_enrolled))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the values and data types of the variables. The output will look like this:\n\n```\nStudent ID: 1 <class 'int'>\nStudent GPA: 3.8 <class 'float'>\nStudent Name: John Doe <class 'str'>\nIs Enrolled: True <class 'bool'>\n```",
