  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's full name and age as input, then prints out a formatted string with the user's name and age. The output should be in the format 'Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.'",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Enter your full name: \")\n    age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n    \n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code defines a `main` function that asks the user for their full name and age, then prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block checks if the script is being run directly or being imported, and if it's being run directly, it calls the `main` function.",
