  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the modular arithmetic operation (a mod b).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef main():\n    a = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    b = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    c = a % b\n    print(\"The result of the operation is:\", c)\n\nmain()\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, defining a `main` function that prompts the user for two numbers, performs the modulo operation, and prints the result. The function is then called at the end of the code to execute the program.",
