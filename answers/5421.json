  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. If the score is above 90, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 90, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 80, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 70, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n3. The `main` function gets the score from the user, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n4. The program uses a simple and readable structure, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95: The output will be \"The grade is: A\"\n* Enter a score of 85: The output will be \"The grade is: B\"\n* Enter a score of 75: The output will be \"The grade is: C\"\n* Enter a score of 65: The output will be \"The grade is: D\"\n* Enter a score of 55: The output will be \"The grade is: F\"\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `grade_calculator.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using the command `python grade_calculator.py`.\n4. Follow the prompt to enter the score, and the program will print the corresponding grade.",
