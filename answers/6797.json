If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their score. The grade is determined by the following criteria:\n\n* A: 90 or above\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the student's score when prompted.\n3. The program will print the student's grade based on their score.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on the score.\n* The `calculate_grade` function takes the score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n* The `main` function gets the score from the user, calculates the grade, and prints the result.",
