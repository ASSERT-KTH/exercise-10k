  "answer": "**String Permutations Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates all possible permutations of a given input string. It uses a recursive approach to swap each character in the string and generate all possible combinations.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_permutations(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all possible permutations of a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of all possible permutations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if the string is empty or has only one character, return it\n    if len(string) <= 1:\n        return [string]\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the permutations\n    permutations = []\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        # Get the remaining characters\n        remaining = string[:i] + string[i+1:]\n\n        # Generate all permutations of the remaining characters\n        for p in get_permutations(remaining):\n            # Append the current character to each permutation\n            permutations.append(char + p)\n\n    return permutations\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    input_string = \"abc\"\n    permutations = get_permutations(input_string)\n\n    print(\"Input string:\", input_string)\n    print(\"Permutations:\")\n    for i, p in enumerate(permutations):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {p}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_permutations` function takes a string as input and returns a list of all possible permutations.\n2. The base case is when the string is empty or has only one character, in which case it returns the string itself.\n3. For longer strings, it iterates over each character, removes it from the string, and generates all permutations of the remaining characters.\n4. It then appends the removed character to each permutation, effectively generating all possible combinations.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `get_permutations` function with an example input string.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nInput string: abc\nPermutations:\n1. abc\n2. acb\n3. bac\n4. bca\n5. cab\n6. cba\n```\n\nNote that the number of permutations grows factorially with the length of the input string. For longer strings, this program may take a significant amount of time to run.",
