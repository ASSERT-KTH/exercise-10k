  "prompt": "Create a program that defines two functions: one to calculate the area of a rectangle and another to calculate its perimeter. Both functions should take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments. The program should then ask the user for the length and width, call the functions with these values, and print out the calculated area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Python. Here it is:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef rectangle_perimeter(length, width):\n    perimeter = (length + width) * 2\n    return perimeter\n\nlength = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\narea = rectangle_area(length, width)\nperimeter = rectangle_perimeter(length, width)\n\nprint(f\"Area: {area}\")\nprint(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the two functions `rectangle_area` and `rectangle_perimeter` as specified. It then asks the user to input the length and width of the rectangle, calls the functions with these values, and prints out the calculated area and perimeter.",
