  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the tax amount based on the user's income. If the income is above 50000, tax is 20%, between 20000 and 50000 tax is 15%, and below 20000 tax is 10%.",
  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the user's income. The tax rates are as follows:\n\n* 20% for income above 50,000\n* 15% for income between 20,000 and 50,000\n* 10% for income below 20,000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax amount based on the user's income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The user's income.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income > 50000:\n        tax_rate = 0.20\n    elif income >= 20000 and income <= 50000:\n        tax_rate = 0.15\n    else:\n        tax_rate = 0.10\n\n    tax_amount = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_amount\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: \"))\n    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)\n\n    print(f\"Your income: {income}\")\n    print(f\"Your tax amount: {tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your net income: {income - tax_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes the user's income as input and calculates the tax amount based on the tax rates.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their income, calculates the tax amount using the `calculate_tax` function, and prints the results.\n3. The tax amount is calculated by multiplying the income by the tax rate.\n4. The net income is calculated by subtracting the tax amount from the income.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter an income of 60000 to calculate the tax amount at a rate of 20%.\n* Enter an income of 30000 to calculate the tax amount at a rate of 15%.\n* Enter an income of 10000 to calculate the tax amount at a rate of 10%.",
