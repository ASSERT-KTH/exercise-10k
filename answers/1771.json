  "answer": "**Fibonacci Number Calculation Function**\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here is a Python function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position of the Fibonacci number to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n <= 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number\n        for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Position of the Fibonacci number to calculate\n    result = fibonacci(n)\n    print(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n*   It first checks if `n` is a non-negative integer and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n*   For `n` less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n` directly since the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to calculate the nth Fibonacci number iteratively.\n*   In each iteration, it updates the values of `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence.\n*   Finally, the function returns the calculated nth Fibonacci number.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n) because it uses a loop that runs `n` times. The space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `a` and `b`.",
