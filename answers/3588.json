  "answer": "**Cube Surface Area Calculator**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n* The `calculate_cube_surface_area` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns its surface area.\n* The surface area of a cube is calculated using the formula: `6 * (side_length ** 2)`.\n* The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_surface_area` function by taking user input and printing the result.\n* The program includes error handling to ensure that the side length is a positive number.\n\n### Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the side length of the cube when prompted.\n3. The program will print the surface area of the cube.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the side length of the cube: 5\nThe surface area of the cube is: 150.00\n```",
