  "answer": "**Most Frequent Word Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string of words as input and returns the most frequent word in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef most_frequent_word(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the most frequent word in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string of words.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The most frequent word in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove punctuation\n    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', input_string.lower())\n\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = cleaned_string.split()\n\n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n\n    # Return the most common word\n    return word_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"This is a test string. The string is just a test.\"\n    most_common = most_frequent_word(input_string)\n    print(f\"The most frequent word is: {most_common}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `most_frequent_word` function takes an input string and converts it to lowercase to ensure the word count is case-insensitive.\n2. It removes punctuation from the string using a regular expression.\n3. The string is then split into individual words.\n4. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word.\n5. The `most_common` method of the `Counter` object returns a list of tuples containing the words and their frequencies, sorted in descending order of frequency. The most frequent word is the first element of this list.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `most_frequent_word` function with an example input string.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program considers different grammatical forms of a word (e.g., \"run\" and \"running\") as separate words. If you want to count different forms of a word together, you may need to use a more advanced natural language processing technique, such as stemming or lemmatization.",
