  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a list of events with their start and end times, and then prints out a schedule of the events for the day.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Event:\n    def __init__(self, name, start_time, end_time):\n        self.name = name\n        self.start_time = datetime.strptime(start_time, \"%H:%M\")\n        self.end_time = datetime.strptime(end_time, \"%H:%M\")\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name}: {self.start_time.strftime('%H:%M')} - {self.end_time.strftime('%H:%M')}\"\n\ndef get_events_from_user():\n    events = []\n    num_events = int(input(\"Enter the number of events: \"))\n\n    for i in range(num_events):\n        name = input(f\"Enter the name of event {i+1}: \")\n        start_time = input(f\"Enter the start time of event {i+1} (HH:MM): \")\n        end_time = input(f\"Enter the end time of event {i+1} (HH:MM): \")\n\n        events.append(Event(name, start_time, end_time))\n\n    return events\n\ndef print_schedule(events):\n    events.sort(key=lambda x: x.start_time)\n\n    for event in events:\n        print(event)\n\ndef main():\n    events = get_events_from_user()\n    print(\"\\nSchedule for the day:\")\n    print_schedule(events)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run this program, simply execute it and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter the number of events, the name of each event, and the start and end times of each event. The program will then print out a schedule of the events for the day, sorted by start time.\n\nHere's an example of how the program might be used:\n\n```\nEnter the number of events: 3\nEnter the name of event 1: Meeting\nEnter the start time of event 1 (HH:MM): 09:00\nEnter the end time of event 1 (HH:MM): 10:00\nEnter the name of event 2: Lunch\nEnter the start time of event 2 (HH:MM): 12:00\nEnter the end time of event 2 (HH:MM): 13:00\nEnter the name of event 3: Conference\nEnter the start time of event 3 (HH:MM): 10:30\nEnter the end time of event 3 (HH:MM): 12:00\n\nSchedule for the day:\nMeeting: 09:00 - 10:00\nConference: 10:30 - 12:00\nLunch: 12:00 - 13:00\n```",
