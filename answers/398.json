  "answer": "**Cone Volume Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cone is:\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, \u03c0 is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cone_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cone given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cone.\n        height (float): The height of the cone.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cone.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cone: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cone: \"))\n\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cone_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cone is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_cone_volume` that takes the radius and height of the cone as input and returns the calculated volume.\n2. The function uses the formula V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h to calculate the volume.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the radius and height of the cone, calculates the volume using the `calculate_cone_volume` function, and prints the result.\n4. The program includes error handling to ensure that the radius and height are non-negative.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g., `cone_volume.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python cone_volume.py`). Follow the prompts to input the radius and height of the cone, and the program will print the calculated volume.",
