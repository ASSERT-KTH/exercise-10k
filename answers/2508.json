  "answer": "**Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes an arithmetic expression as input and evaluates it.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates an arithmetic expression.\n\n    Args:\n        expression (str): The arithmetic expression to evaluate.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the evaluation.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use eval() function to evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any exceptions that occur during evaluation\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    expression = input(\"Enter an arithmetic expression: \")\n    result = evaluate_expression(expression)\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `evaluate_expression` function takes an arithmetic expression as a string input and uses the built-in `eval()` function to evaluate it.\n*   The `eval()` function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `evaluate_expression` function by taking user input and printing the result.\n*   The program handles any exceptions that occur during evaluation and prints an error message if necessary.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Evaluating simple arithmetic expressions: `2 + 3`, `5 * 6`, `10 / 2`\n*   Evaluating expressions with multiple operators: `2 + 3 * 4`, `10 / 2 - 1`\n\n### Note\n\n*   The `eval()` function can pose a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input, as it can evaluate any Python expression. In this example, we're using it for simplicity, but in a real-world application, you should consider using a safer method, such as using a parsing library or writing your own parser.\n*   This program does not support advanced mathematical functions like trigonometry, exponentiation, or logarithms. For more complex mathematical expressions, you may want to consider using a library like `math` or `sympy`.",
