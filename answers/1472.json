  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer input from the user, calculates the absolute value, and prints the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << abs(n);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `cmath` library to access the `abs` function, which calculates the absolute value of an integer. The `using namespace std;` directive allows us to use standard library functions and objects without prefixing them with `std::`.\n\nThe program reads an integer from the user using `cin`, calculates the absolute value using `abs`, and prints the result to the console using `cout`. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
