  "answer": "**List Difference Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two lists of numbers. The difference is calculated as the absolute difference between corresponding elements in the two lists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_list_difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two lists of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two input lists.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the two input lists have different lengths.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"The two input lists must have the same length\")\n\n    return [abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    try:\n        difference = calculate_list_difference(list1, list2)\n        print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n        print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n        print(\"Difference:\", difference)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_list_difference` function takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two input lists.\n2. The function checks if the two input lists have the same length. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The function uses a list comprehension to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two input lists.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_list_difference` function with two example lists.\n5. The program prints the two input lists and the resulting difference list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nList 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nList 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nDifference: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n```",
