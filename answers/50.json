  "answer": "**Next Greater Element Problem**\n=====================================\n\nGiven an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. If there is no greater element, print -1.\n\n**Example**\n-----------\n\nInput: `[4, 5, 2, 25]`\nOutput: `[5, 25, 25, -1]`\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nWe can solve this problem using a stack data structure.\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\n3. For each element, pop all elements from the stack that are smaller than the current element.\n4. For each popped element, update its next greater element to the current element.\n5. Push the current element onto the stack.\n6. After iterating through the entire array, pop any remaining elements from the stack and update their next greater element to -1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef next_greater_element(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the next greater element for each element in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The next greater element for each element in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    result = [-1] * len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Pop all elements from the stack that are smaller than the current element\n        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:\n            # Update the next greater element for the popped element\n            result[stack.pop()] = arr[i]\n        # Push the current element onto the stack\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\narr = [4, 5, 2, 25]\nprint(next_greater_element(arr))  # Output: [5, 25, 25, -1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we iterate through the array once and perform a constant amount of work for each element.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we use a stack to store the indices of the elements, and in the worst case, the stack can grow up to the size of the input array.",
