  "answer": "**Function to Find Pairs of Elements with a Given Sum**\n=====================================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven an array of integers and a target sum, find all pairs of elements that sum to the target.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python function that uses a two-pointer technique to find all pairs of elements with a given sum:\n```python\ndef find_pairs(nums, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all pairs of elements in an array that sum to a given target.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n        target (int): The target sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of elements that sum to the target.\n    \"\"\"\n    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to use the two-pointer technique\n    pairs = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1  # Initialize two pointers\n\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            pairs.append((nums[left], nums[right]))  # Add the pair to the list\n            left += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right\n            right -= 1  # Move the right pointer to the left\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum\n        else:\n            right -= 1  # Move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum\n\n    return pairs\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\ntarget = 7\nprint(find_pairs(nums, target))  # Output: [(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)]\n```\n### Explanation\n\n1. Sort the input array to use the two-pointer technique.\n2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n3. Iterate through the array, calculating the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` indices.\n4. If the sum is equal to the target, add the pair to the result list and move both pointers.\n5. If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.\n6. If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n7. Return the list of pairs that sum to the target.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. The subsequent iteration has a time complexity of O(n), but it is dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n) for the output list, where n is the length of the input array. The input array is sorted in-place, so no additional space is required for the sorting step.",
