  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem. This program uses the built-in `statistics` module to calculate the mean, median, and mode.\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = statistics.mean(array)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = statistics.median(array)\n\n    # Calculate the mode\n    try:\n        mode = statistics.mode(array)\n    except statistics.StatisticsError:\n        # If there is not exactly one most common value, calculate all modes\n        mode = statistics.multimode(array)\n\n    return {\n        \"mean\": mean,\n        \"median\": median,\n        \"mode\": mode\n    }\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]\nstats = calculate_statistics(array)\n\nprint(\"Mean:\", stats[\"mean\"])\nprint(\"Median:\", stats[\"median\"])\nprint(\"Mode:\", stats[\"mode\"])\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_statistics` that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given array. The function returns a dictionary containing these values. If there is not exactly one most common value in the array (i.e., there are multiple modes), the function calculates all modes using `statistics.multimode`.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use this function with an example array. It prints the mean, median, and mode of the array.",
