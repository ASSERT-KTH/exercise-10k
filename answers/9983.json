  "answer": "**Voting Eligibility Checker**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis code snippet uses a boolean variable to determine if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef is_eligible_to_vote(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The person's age.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the minimum voting age\n    minimum_voting_age = 18\n\n    # Use a boolean variable to store the eligibility status\n    is_eligible = age >= minimum_voting_age\n\n    return is_eligible\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    person_name = \"John Doe\"\n    person_age = 25\n\n    eligibility_status = is_eligible_to_vote(person_age)\n\n    if eligibility_status:\n        print(f\"{person_name} is eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{person_name} is not eligible to vote.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_eligible_to_vote` function takes an `age` parameter and checks if it is greater than or equal to the `minimum_voting_age` (18).\n2. The result of this comparison is stored in the `is_eligible` boolean variable.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `is_eligible_to_vote` function by checking the eligibility status of a person with a given age.\n4. The eligibility status is then printed to the console.\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the `minimum_voting_age` variable to change the minimum age required for voting.\n* This code snippet assumes that the person's age is a non-negative integer. You may want to add error handling to handle invalid input.",
