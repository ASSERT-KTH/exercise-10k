  "answer": "### Creating a Dictionary with Names and Ages\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to create a dictionary with names as keys and ages as values, and then print the dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary with names and ages\npeople = {\n    \"John\": 25,\n    \"Alice\": 30,\n    \"Bob\": 35,\n    \"Eve\": 20\n}\n\n# Print the dictionary\nprint(people)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by defining a dictionary named `people`.\n*   Inside the dictionary, we add key-value pairs where the keys are names (`\"John\"`, `\"Alice\"`, etc.) and the values are their corresponding ages.\n*   Finally, we use the `print()` function to output the dictionary.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the dictionary in the following format:\n\n```python\n{'John': 25, 'Alice': 30, 'Bob': 35, 'Eve': 20}\n```\n\nYou can modify the code to add or remove key-value pairs as per your requirements.",
