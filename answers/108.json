  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. It repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the GCD of two numbers: `gcd(12, 15)` returns `3`\n* Find the GCD of two numbers with different signs: `gcd(-12, 15)` returns `3`\n* Find the GCD of two numbers with a GCD of 1: `gcd(7, 11)` returns `1`",
