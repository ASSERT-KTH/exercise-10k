  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and the time taken.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed of an object.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object in meters.\n        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance in meters: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \"))\n\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed is {speed} meters per second\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance in meters when prompted (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the time in seconds when prompted (e.g., 10).\n4. The program will calculate and display the speed (e.g., 10.0 meters per second).\n\n### Note\n\n* This program assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., distance and time are non-negative).\n* The program checks for division by zero and raises a `ValueError` if the time is zero.",
