  "prompt": "Create a program that determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements. The program should take an integer as input and print out 'Positive' if the number is greater than 0, 'Negative' if the number is less than 0, and 'Zero' if the number is equal to 0.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# input\nx = int(input())\n\n# conditional statements\nif x > 0:\n    print(\"Positive\")\nelif x < 0:\n    print(\"Negative\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Zero\")\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, using the `input()` function to get an integer input from the user, and then using the `if-elif-else` statement to determine whether the input is positive, negative, or zero, and printing the corresponding string.",
