  "prompt": "Write a function that takes in a dictionary containing student information, where each key is a student ID and each value is another dictionary containing the student's name, age, and grades. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student IDs as keys and their average grades as values.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary. This function will take into account the student's ID, name, age, and grades to produce a new dictionary with the student IDs and their corresponding average grades. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in the given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        student_info (dict): A dictionary containing student information.\n            Each key is a student ID and each value is another dictionary containing the student's name, age, and grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the student IDs as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student ID in the student_info dictionary\n    for student_id, info in student_info.items():\n        # Check if the 'grades' key exists in the student's info dictionary\n        if 'grades' in info:\n            # Calculate the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades\n            # We assume that the grades are stored in a list or other iterable\n            average_grade = sum(info['grades']) / len(info['grades'])\n        else:\n            # If the 'grades' key does not exist, set the average grade to None\n            average_grade = None\n\n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student_id] = average_grade\n\n    # Return the average_grades dictionary\n    return average_grades\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_average_grades` initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the calculated average grades for each student.\n*   It then iterates over each student ID in the `student_info` dictionary, checking if the 'grades' key exists in the student's info dictionary. If it does, the function calculates the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n*   The calculated average grade is stored in the `average_grades` dictionary with the corresponding student ID as the key. If the 'grades' key does not exist, the average grade is set to `None`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary containing the student IDs and their average grades.",
