  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the speed given the distance and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed given the distance and time.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in meters.\n        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance in meters: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \"))\n\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed is {speed} meters per second\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_speed` function takes in `distance` and `time` as arguments and returns the calculated speed.\n*   The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.\n*   The program checks if the time is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input the distance and time, and the calculated speed is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the speed of a car that travels 100 meters in 10 seconds:\n    *   Input: distance = 100, time = 10\n    *   Output: The speed is 10.0 meters per second\n*   Calculate the speed of a runner who runs 500 meters in 60 seconds:\n    *   Input: distance = 500, time = 60\n    *   Output: The speed is 8.333333333333334 meters per second",
