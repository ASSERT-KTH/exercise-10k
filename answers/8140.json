  "answer": "**Hangman Game Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program implements a game of Hangman using if/else statements. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's gallows is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word or the gallows is complete and the player is \"hanged.\"\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    word_length = len(word)\n    \n    # Initialize the display with underscores\n    display = ['_'] * word_length\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_letters = []\n    guessed_words = []\n    tries = 6\n    \n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(display_hangman(tries))\n    print(' '.join(display))\n    \n    while not guessed and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Please guess a letter or word: \").lower()\n        \n        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_letters:\n                print(\"You already guessed the letter\", guess)\n            elif guess not in word:\n                print(guess, \"is not in the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            else:\n                print(\"Good job,\", guess, \"is in the word!\")\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n                word_as_list = list(word)\n                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n                for index in indices:\n                    display[index] = guess\n        elif len(guess) == word_length and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_words:\n                print(\"You already guessed the word\", guess)\n            elif guess != word:\n                print(guess, \"is not the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_words.append(guess)\n            else:\n                guessed = True\n                display = list(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Not a valid guess.\")\n        \n        print(display_hangman(tries))\n        print(' '.join(display))\n    \n    if guessed:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you ran out of tries.

The program starts by importing the `random` module and defining a list of words to choose from.\n2. The `hangman` function is defined, which implements the game logic.\n3. The function chooses a random word from the list and initializes the display with underscores.\n4. The game loop runs until the player guesses the word or the gallows is complete.\n5. Inside the loop, the player is prompted to guess a letter or word.\n6. The guess is checked to see if it is a single letter or a word.\n7. If the guess is a letter, it is checked to see if it is in the word. If it is, the display is updated. If not, the number of tries is decreased.\n8. If the guess is a word, it is checked to see if it is the correct word. If it is, the game ends and the player wins. If not, the number of tries is decreased.\n9. The `display_hangman` function is used to draw the",
