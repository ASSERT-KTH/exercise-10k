  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a calendar for a given month and year using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses the calendar module to print a calendar for a given month and year.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef print_monthly_calendar(year, month):\n    # Create a plain text calendar\n    c = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Print the month and year\n    print(calendar.month_name[month], year)\n    print(\"Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su\")\n\n    # Print each week of the month\n    for week in c:\n        for day in week:\n            if day == 0:\n                print(\"  \", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{day:2d}\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Example usage:\nyear = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\nmonth = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n\nprint_monthly_calendar(year, month)\n```\n\nTo run this program, simply copy and paste it into a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it. It will prompt you to enter the year and month, and then it will print the calendar for that month and year.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. It first imports the calendar module, which provides useful utilities for working with dates and times.\n2. It defines a function called `print_monthly_calendar` that takes a year and month as input.\n3. Inside this function, it uses the `calendar.monthcalendar` function to get a matrix representing a month\u2019s calendar. Each row represents a week; days outside of the month a represented by zeros.\n4. It then prints the month and year, followed by the days of the week.\n5. It uses a for loop to print each week of the month. For each day in the week, it checks if the day is zero (i.e., if it's outside of the month). If it is, it prints two spaces; otherwise, it prints the day of the month.\n6. Finally, it uses a nested loop to print the calendar for the given month and year. The outer loop iterates over each week in the month, and the inner loop iterates over each day in the week.",
