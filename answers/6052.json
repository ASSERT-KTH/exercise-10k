It uses a list `recipes` to store instances of `Recipe`.\n\nThe program provides the following functions:\n\n*   `add_recipe()`: Prompts the user to enter the name, ingredients, and cooking time of a recipe, creates a new `Recipe` instance, and adds it to the `recipes` list.\n*   `search_by_ingredients()`: Asks the user for an ingredient, searches the `recipes` list for recipes containing that ingredient, and displays the matching recipes.\n*   `search_by_cooking_time()`: Asks the user for a maximum cooking time, searches the `recipes` list for recipes with a cooking time less than or equal to the specified time, and displays the matching recipes.\n*   `display_recipes()`: Displays all recipes in the `recipes` list.\n\nThe `main()` function provides a menu-driven interface, allowing users to add, search, and display recipes, as well as exit the program.",
