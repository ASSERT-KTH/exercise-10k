  "answer": "Here is the code as per the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Current Date]\n# Description: A program to calculate student grades based on their scores\n\ndef student_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        score = input(\"Enter your score (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        if score.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        score = int(score)\n        grade = student_grade(score)\n        print(f\"Your grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote: I've left the author and date fields blank for you to fill in. Also, I've used `f` strings to format the output string, which is a feature available in Python 3.6 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use the `format()` method or string concatenation instead.",
