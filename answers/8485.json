  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one to calculate the area and another to calculate the perimeter. The program should then call these functions with the provided length and width to print the results.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle\n\n# Problem: Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n# The program should have two functions: one to calculate the area and another to calculate the perimeter.\n# The program should then call these functions with the provided length and width to print the results.\n\n# Solution:\ndef areaRectangle(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef perimeterRectangle(length, width):\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return perimeter\n\n# Main Program\nlength = 5\nwidth = 7\narea = areaRectangle(length, width)\nperimeter = perimeterRectangle(length, width)\n\nprint(f\"Area: {area}\")\nprint(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, including the comments and the example use case. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
