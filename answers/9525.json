  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints out all prime numbers up to that integer. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that prints all prime numbers up to the given integer.\n\n```python\ndef print_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints all prime numbers up to the given integer n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit for printing prime numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    for num in range(2, n + 1):\n        is_prime = True\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            print(num)\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n    print_primes(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `print_primes(n)` that takes an integer `n` and prints all prime numbers up to `n`.\n- Inside `print_primes(n)`, we loop over all numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive).\n- For each number, we check if it is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root. If it is divisible by any number, it's not a prime number.\n- If the number is prime, we print it.\n- In the `main` function, we take an integer input from the user and call `print_primes(n)` with the input number.\n\nExample usage:\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter an integer. After you enter the integer, it will print all prime numbers up to that integer. For example, if you enter `20`, the output will be:\n\n```\n2\n3\n5\n7\n11\n13\n17\n19\n```",
