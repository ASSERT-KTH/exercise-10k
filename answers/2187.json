  "prompt": "Write a function to count the number of words in a given string. The function should take a string as input and return the word count.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function to count the number of words in a given string, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the number of words in the string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count words from.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to split the input string into a list of words\n    # We can use the split() method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Now, we can simply return the length of the list, which represents the number of words\n    # The len() function returns the number of items in an object\n    return len(words)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(count_words(\"Hello world, this is a test string\"))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `count_words` takes an input string and splits it into a list of words using the `split()` method, which divides a string into a list where each word is a list item.\n* The `split()` method without arguments splits the string at whitespace characters, effectively separating words.\n* The function then returns the length of the list, which represents the number of words, using the `len()` function.\n* For example, when you call `count_words(\"Hello world, this is a test string\")`, it correctly returns `7`, which is the number of words in the input string.",
