  "answer": "**Perfect Square Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares because they can be expressed as 2^2, 3^2, 4^2 respectively.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [4, 9, 16, 20, 25]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_perfect_square(num):\n            print(f\"{num} is a perfect square.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{num} is not a perfect square.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `is_perfect_square` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's a perfect square, `False` otherwise.\n2. If `n` is negative, it's not a perfect square, so we return `False`.\n3. We calculate the square root of `n` using the `math.sqrt` function.\n4. We check if the square root is an integer by comparing it to its integer value using `int(sqrt)`. If they're equal, then `n` is a perfect square.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `is_perfect_square` function with a list of example numbers.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\n4 is a perfect square.\n9 is a perfect square.\n16 is a perfect square.\n20 is not a perfect square.\n25 is a perfect square.\n```",
