  "prompt": "Write a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (integer, float, string, boolean) and prints out their values.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n/* \n * This program demonstrates how to declare and initialize variables of different data types in C.\n * It shows how to declare and initialize variables of integer, float, and character types.\n * It also prints out the values of the variables using printf() function.\n */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare and initialize variables\n    int a = 5;\n    float b = 3.5;\n    char c = 'A';\n    char d[] = \"Hello, World!\";\n    _Bool e = 1;\n\n    // Print out variable values\n    printf(\"a = %d\\n\", a);\n    printf(\"b = %f\\n\", b);\n    printf(\"c = %c\\n\", c);\n    printf(\"d = %s\\n\", d);\n    printf(\"e = %d\\n\", e);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
