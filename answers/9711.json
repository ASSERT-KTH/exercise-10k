  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    result = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### How the program works:\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`.\n2. **Add the numbers**: Inside the function, we simply add `num1` and `num2` together and return the result.\n3. **Get user input**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we ask the user to input two numbers using the `input` function.\n4. **Call the function**: We call the `add_numbers` function with the user's input and store the result in the `result` variable.\n5. **Print the result**: Finally, we print the sum of the two numbers to the console.\n\n### Running the program:\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `add_numbers.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python add_numbers.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.\n5. The program will print the sum of the two numbers.",
