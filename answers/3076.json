  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks whether a given password is strong or not. A strong password should contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks whether a password is strong or not.\n\n    A strong password should contain at least 8 characters, including:\n    - Uppercase letters\n    - Lowercase letters\n    - Numbers\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the regular expression pattern for a strong password\n    pattern = r\"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).{8,}$\"\n\n    # Check if the password matches the pattern\n    if re.match(pattern, password):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the password from the user\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n\n    # Check the password strength\n    if check_password_strength(password):\n        print(\"The password is strong.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The password is not strong. It should contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_password_strength` function takes a password as input and checks whether it matches the regular expression pattern for a strong password.\n2. The regular expression pattern `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).{8,}$` checks for the following:\n   - `(?=.*[a-z])`: At least one lowercase letter.\n   - `(?=.*[A-Z])`: At least one uppercase letter.\n   - `(?=.*\\d)`: At least one digit.\n   - `.{8,}`: At least 8 characters.\n3. The `main` function gets the password from the user, checks its strength using the `check_password_strength` function, and prints out the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a strong password (e.g., \"P@ssw0rd\") to see the \"The password is strong.\" message.\n* Run the program and enter a weak password (e.g., \"password\") to see the \"The password is not strong. It should contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.\" message.",
