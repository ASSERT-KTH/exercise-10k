  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. If the guess is higher than the number, print 'too high'. If the guess is lower than the number, print 'too low'. If the guess is correct, print 'you won!' and exit the program.",
  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game Program**\n\nHere is a simple Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n\n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high\")\n        else:\n            print(\"You won!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's input is a valid integer and if it is within the correct range (1-100).\n4. If the input is valid, the program checks if the guess is correct. If it is not, it prints \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" depending on the guess.\n5. If the guess is correct, the program prints \"You won!\" and exits the loop.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python number_guessing_game.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
