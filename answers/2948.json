  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two input strings. The LCS is the longest sequence of characters that appears in both strings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * (len(str2) + 1) for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the 2D array\n    for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = len(str1), len(str2)\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    # Return the longest common subsequence in the correct order\n    return \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"AGGTAB\"\n    str2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\n    print(f\"Longest common subsequence: {longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The program initializes a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences.\n2.  It fills the 2D array by comparing characters from both strings. If the characters match, the length of the common subsequence increases by 1.\n3.  After filling the 2D array, the program reconstructs the longest common subsequence by tracing back the array from the bottom-right corner.\n4.  The reconstructed subsequence is returned in the correct order by reversing the list of characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. This is because the program fills a 2D array of size (m + 1) \\* (n + 1) and then reconstructs the longest common subsequence.",
