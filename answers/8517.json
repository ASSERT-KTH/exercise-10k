  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Program**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    while num2 != 0:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return abs(num1)\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\n    # Alternative method using math.gcd\n    gcd_alt = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} (alternative method) is: {gcd_alt}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. The algorithm repeatedly replaces `num1` and `num2` with `num2` and the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2`, until `num2` becomes 0.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers, calculates their GCD using the `calculate_gcd` function, and prints the result.\n4. An alternative method using the `math.gcd` function is also demonstrated.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the GCD of 48 and 18: `calculate_gcd(48, 18)` returns 6.\n* Find the GCD of 24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns 6.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers.\n* The `math.gcd` function is a built-in Python function that also calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.\n* The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.",
