  "answer": "**Swapping Variables without a Temporary Variable**\n\nYou can swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable by utilizing the following methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using Arithmetic Operations\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n    \n    This method uses arithmetic operations to swap the values.\n    However, it may cause an overflow for large numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a = a + b  # Add a and b and store the result in a\n    b = a - b  # Subtract b from a (which is a + b) and store the result in b\n    a = a - b  # Subtract b (which is the original a) from a (which is a + b) and store the result in a\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_arithmetic(5, 10)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using XOR Operator\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_xor(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n    \n    This method uses the XOR operator to swap the values.\n    It works by using the properties of XOR: a ^ a = 0 and a ^ 0 = a.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a = a ^ b  # XOR a and b and store the result in a\n    b = a ^ b  # XOR a (which is a ^ b) and b, and store the result in b\n    a = a ^ b  # XOR a (which is a ^ b) and b (which is the original a), and store the result in a\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_xor(5, 10)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Tuple Packing and Unpacking\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_tuple(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.\n    \n    This method uses tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a, b = b, a  # Pack b and a into a tuple and then unpack the tuple into a and b\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n\n# Example usage:\nswap_variables_tuple(5, 10)\n```\n\n**Recommendation:** The most Pythonic and efficient way to swap variables is by using tuple packing and unpacking (Method 3). This method is concise, readable, and does not have any potential issues like overflow.",
