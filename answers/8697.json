  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The game will provide hints to the user, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help them guess the correct number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1. Run the game by executing the `number_guessing_game` function.\n2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n3. Take a guess by typing a number and pressing Enter.\n4. The game will provide a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help you guess the correct number.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. The game will display the number of attempts it took you to find the correct number.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nToo low!\nTake a guess: 75\nToo high!\nTake a guess: 67\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
