  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the multiplication tables for numbers from 1 to 5. The program should use a loop to iterate over the numbers and print the multiplication table for each number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Multiplication table for {i}:\");\n            for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine($\"{i} x {j} = {i * j}\");\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nI hope this meets the requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any modifications.",
