  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height. The program should take the weight and height as input, and print the corresponding BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the BMI\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\n# Define a function to determine the BMI category\ndef determine_bmi_category(bmi):\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9:\n        return \"normal\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi <= 29.9:\n        return \"overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"obese\"\n\n# Main program\nweight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\nheight = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\nbmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\nbmi_category = determine_bmi_category(bmi)\n\nprint(f\"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f}. You are {bmi_category}.\")\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined, including getting the user's weight and height, calculating the BMI, determining the BMI category, and printing the result. The `calculate_bmi` function calculates the BMI using the formula `bmi = weight / (height ** 2)`, and the `determine_bmi_category` function uses conditional statements to determine the BMI category based on the calculated BMI value. The main program gets the user's weight and height, calculates the BMI, determines the BMI category, and prints the result.",
