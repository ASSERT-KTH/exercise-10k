  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int or float): The first number.\n        num2 (int or float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the difference\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_difference` that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calculates their difference using `calculate_difference`, and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that this program calculates the difference as `num1 - num2`. If you want to calculate the absolute difference (i.e., the difference regardless of the order of the numbers), you can modify the `calculate_difference` function to return `abs(num1 - num2)`.",
