  "answer": "**Factorial Function**\n======================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function calculates the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if the input number is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   If the input number is 0 or 1, it returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n*   For input numbers greater than 1, it calculates the factorial using a `for` loop that multiplies all integers from 2 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   The result is then returned by the function.\n\n### Alternative Recursive Implementation\n\nIf you prefer a recursive approach, you can implement the factorial function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef factorial_recursive(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial_recursive(num)}\")\n```\n\nThis recursive implementation uses the same logic as the iterative version but relies on function calls to calculate the factorial. However, please note that recursive functions can be less efficient and may cause stack overflow errors for large input values due to the repeated function calls.",
