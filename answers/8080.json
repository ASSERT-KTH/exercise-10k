  "answer": "**Generator Function Example**\n================================\n\nHere's an example of a Python function that returns a generator. This function generates the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator function to generate the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    print(\"Fibonacci sequence:\")\n    for num in fibonacci(n):\n        print(num)\n```\n\n**How it works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n2. The function initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).\n3. The function uses a `for` loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence.\n4. Inside the loop, the `yield` statement is used to produce the next number in the sequence. This allows the function to remember its state and pick up where it left off when called again.\n5. The `a` and `b` variables are updated to the next two numbers in the sequence using the recurrence relation `a, b = b, a + b`.\n6. The function continues to generate numbers until the loop completes, at which point it stops.\n\n**Using the Generator**\n-------------------------\n\nTo use the generator, simply call the `fibonacci` function with the desired number of Fibonacci numbers as an argument. The function will return a generator object, which can be iterated over using a `for` loop. Each iteration will produce the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.",
