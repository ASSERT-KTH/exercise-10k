  "answer": "**Bill Splitter Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that splits a bill among a group of people.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_split_bill(total_bill, tax_rate, tip_rate, people):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the split bill among a group of people.\n\n    Args:\n    - total_bill (float): The total bill before tax and tip.\n    - tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08).\n    - tip_rate (float): The tip rate as a decimal (e.g., 15% = 0.15).\n    - people (int): The number of people to split the bill.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The amount each person owes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the total bill with tax and tip\n    total_bill_with_tax = total_bill * (1 + tax_rate)\n    total_bill_with_tax_and_tip = total_bill_with_tax * (1 + tip_rate)\n\n    # Calculate the split bill\n    split_bill = total_bill_with_tax_and_tip / people\n\n    return split_bill\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Bill Splitter Program\")\n\n    # Get the total bill from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill: $\"))\n            if total_bill < 0:\n                print(\"Total bill cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the tax rate from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (in %): \"))\n            if tax_rate < 0:\n                print(\"Tax rate cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            tax_rate /= 100  # Convert tax rate to decimal\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the tip rate from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tip_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tip rate (in %): \"))\n            if tip_rate < 0:\n                print(\"Tip rate cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            tip_rate /= 100  # Convert tip rate to decimal\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the number of people from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            people = int(input(\"Enter the number of people: \"))\n            if people <= 0:\n                print(\"Number of people must be greater than 0.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the split bill\n    split_bill = calculate_split_bill(total_bill, tax_rate, tip_rate, people)\n    print(f\"Each person owes: ${split_bill:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the total bill, tax rate, tip rate, and number of people. After you enter this information, it will calculate and print the amount each person owes.\n\n```\nBill Splitter Program\nEnter the total bill: $100\nEnter the tax rate (in %): 8\nEnter the tip rate (in %): 15\nEnter the number of people: 4\nEach person owes: $31.50\n```\n\nNote that the program uses input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and rates. It also uses formatting to display the result with two decimal places.",
