  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the total cost of a purchase given the price and quantity of items.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the total cost of a purchase:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(price, quantity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a purchase.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The price of a single item.\n        quantity (int): The number of items.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the purchase.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_cost = price * quantity\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the price and quantity from the user\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price of an item: $\"))\n    quantity = int(input(\"Enter the quantity of items: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, quantity)\n    print(f\"The total cost is: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_total_cost` that takes two arguments: `price` and `quantity`.\n2. Inside the function, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the `price` and `quantity`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the price and quantity of items.\n4. It then calls the `calculate_total_cost` function with the user's input and displays the result.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Enter the price of an item: $10.99\n  Enter the quantity of items: 2\n  The total cost is: $21.98\n* Enter the price of an item: $5.50\n  Enter the quantity of items: 1\n  The total cost is: $5.50\n\n### Running the Program\n1. Save the code in a file named `total_cost_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python total_cost_calculator.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the price and quantity of items.",
