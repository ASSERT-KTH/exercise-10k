The `calculate_average_grades` function takes a dictionary `student_grades` as input, where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.\n2.  It initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n3.  The function then iterates over each student in the `student_grades` dictionary.\n4.  For each student, it checks if the list of grades is not empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n5.  The average grade is then stored in the `average_grades` dictionary with the student's name as the key.\n6.  If the list of grades is empty for a student, the function stores `None` as the average grade.\n7.  Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary.\n8.  In the example usage, we create a dictionary `student_grades` with some sample data and call the `calculate_average_grades` function to calculate the average grades for each student.\n9.  The average grades are then printed out for each student, rounded to two decimal places. If a student has no grades available, it prints a message indicating that.",
