  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its square, with a docstring that describes the function's behavior",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that calculates the square of a given number and provide a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef square_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a number as an argument and returns its square.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number to be squared.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The square of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # First, we check if the input is a number\n    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a number\")\n\n    # Now, we calculate the square of the number using the exponentiation operator (**)\n    # The exponentiation operator (**), when used with a power of 2, calculates the square of a number\n    square = num ** 2\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated square\n    return square\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `square_number` takes one argument `num`, which is checked to ensure it's either an integer or a float using `isinstance(num, (int, float))`. If not, a TypeError is raised.\n* The square of the input number is calculated using the exponentiation operator `**` with a power of 2, as seen in `num ** 2`.\n* The calculated square is then returned by the function.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its behavior, including the type of input it expects and the type of output it returns.",
