  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their absolute difference.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the absolute difference between two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef absolute_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The absolute difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(num1 - num2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the absolute difference\n    difference = absolute_difference(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The absolute difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `absolute_difference` that takes two numbers as input and returns their absolute difference. The `main` function gets the two numbers from the user, calculates the absolute difference using the `absolute_difference` function, and then prints the result.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `absolute_difference.py`) and run it with Python (for example, `python absolute_difference.py`). Then, follow the prompts to enter the two numbers, and the program will print their absolute difference.",
