  "prompt": "Write a program to add two numbers and print the result",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that adds two numbers and prints the result:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    result = num1 + num2\n    return result\n\n# Get the two numbers from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. It then prompts the user to enter two numbers, calls the function with these numbers, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Running the program and entering `5` and `7` when prompted will output: `The sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is 12.0`\n* Running the program and entering `10.5` and `2.8` when prompted will output: `The sum of 10.5 and 2.8 is 13.3`\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The `add_numbers` function is defined with two parameters: `num1` and `num2`.\n2. Inside the function, the `result` variable is calculated by adding `num1` and `num2` together.\n3. The `result` is then returned by the function.\n4. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, which are stored in the `num1` and `num2` variables.\n5. The `add_numbers` function is called with `num1` and `num2` as arguments, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.\n6. Finally, the program prints out the result, including the original numbers and their sum.",
