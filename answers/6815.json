  "prompt": "Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in three parameters: student_name, assignment_score, and exam_score. The function should calculate the student's final grade based on the assignment score (30% of the final grade) and the exam score (70% of the final grade). The function should return a string that includes the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates a student's final grade based on their assignment and exam scores. This function will return a string containing the student's name and their final grade as a percentage. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(student_name, assignment_score, exam_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the student's final grade based on their assignment score and exam score.\n\n    Parameters:\n    student_name (str): The name of the student.\n    assignment_score (float): The score of the assignment.\n    exam_score (float): The score of the exam.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string containing the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to calculate the weight of the assignment score in the final grade, which is 30%.\n    # We multiply the assignment score by 0.3 to get the weighted assignment score.\n    weighted_assignment_score = assignment_score * 0.3\n    \n    # Next, we need to calculate the weight of the exam score in the final grade, which is 70%.\n    # We multiply the exam score by 0.7 to get the weighted exam score.\n    weighted_exam_score = exam_score * 0.7\n    \n    # Now, we can calculate the final grade by adding the weighted assignment score and the weighted exam score.\n    final_grade = weighted_assignment_score + weighted_exam_score\n    \n    # Finally, we return a string that includes the student's name and their final grade as a percentage.\n    # We use the format function to insert the student's name and their final grade into the string.\n    # We also round the final grade to two decimal places for better readability.\n    return \"{}'s final grade is {:.2f}%\".format(student_name, final_grade)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_grade` takes in three parameters: `student_name`, `assignment_score`, and `exam_score`. It calculates the student's final grade by weighting the `assignment_score` at 30% and the `exam_score` at 70%.\n* The weighted scores are calculated by multiplying `assignment_score` by 0.3 and `exam_score` by 0.7, and then stored in `weighted_assignment_score` and `weighted_exam_score` respectively.\n* The final grade is calculated by adding `weighted_assignment_score` and `weighted_exam_score`, and then returned as a string along with the `student_name`.\n* The returned string is formatted to display the student's name and their final grade as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places for better readability.",
