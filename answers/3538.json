  "answer": "**Pascal's Triangle Generator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates Pascal's triangle up to a specified number of rows (`n`) using a while loop.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates Pascal's triangle up to n rows.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    triangle = [[1]]\n    row = 1\n    while row < n:\n        # Initialize the new row with 1\n        new_row = [1]\n        # Calculate the middle elements of the new row\n        for i in range(1, row):\n            new_row.append(triangle[row - 1][i - 1] + triangle[row - 1][i])\n        # Append the last element (1) to the new row\n        new_row.append(1)\n        # Add the new row to the triangle\n        triangle.append(new_row)\n        # Increment the row counter\n        row += 1\n    return triangle\n\ndef print_pascals_triangle(triangle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints Pascal's triangle in a formatted manner.\n\n    Args:\n        triangle (list): A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - len(row)), end='')\n        for num in row:\n            print(f'{num} ', end='')\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\n    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_pascals_triangle` function initializes the triangle with the first row `[1]`.\n2. It then enters a while loop, which continues until `row` reaches `n`.\n3. In each iteration, a new row is generated by:\n\t* Initializing the new row with `1`.\n\t* Calculating the middle elements of the new row by summing the corresponding elements from the previous row.\n\t* Appending the last element (`1`) to the new row.\n4. The new row is then added to the triangle.\n5. The `print_pascals_triangle` function prints the triangle in a formatted manner, using spaces to align the rows.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user for the number of rows, generates the triangle, and prints it.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the number of rows: 5\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```",
