  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's age and grade level as input, and prints 'Eligible' if the student is eligible to participate in a program (ages 13-19, grades 7-12), and 'Not Eligible' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Based on the specifications, here is the code:\n```\nage = int(input(\"Enter age: \"))\ngrade = int(input(\"Enter grade: \"))\n\nif age >= 13 and age <= 19 and grade >= 7 and grade <= 12:\n    print(\"Eligible\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not Eligible\")\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified:\n\n1. It imports no modules (not applicable in this case).\n2. It defines two integer variables `age` and `grade` using the `input` function.\n3. It uses an `if` statement to check if the student is eligible based on the conditions specified.\n4. It prints \"Eligible\" if the student is eligible and \"Not Eligible\" otherwise.\n\nNote that I used the `int` function to convert the input to integers, as specified in the requirements. This is because the `input` function returns a string, and we need to convert it to an integer to perform the comparisons correctly.",
