  "prompt": "Write a program that determines a student's grade based on their score. If the score is above 90, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 90, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 80, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 70, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that determines a student's grade based on their score.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score > 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n*   The `main` function takes the score as input from the user, calls the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses `if-elif-else` statements to check the score against the given conditions and assign the corresponding grade.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the student's score. For example, if you enter `85`, it will output `The student's grade is: B`.",
