It generates a sequence of numbers based on the provided formula, starting from the initial value, and stopping when the maximum value is reached.\n*   The `formula` function is a simple example that doubles the input number.\n*   In the `generate_sequence` function, a while loop is used to generate the sequence. It starts with the `initial_value` and applies the `formula` function to get the next value in the sequence. This process continues until the `max_value` is reached.\n*   The generated sequence is stored in a list and returned by the `generate_sequence` function.\n*   Finally, the program generates a sequence of numbers based on the formula, starting from 1, and stopping when the value exceeds 100. The generated sequence is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Fibonacci Sequence**: You can modify the `formula` function to generate the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers to get the next number.\n*   **Geometric Sequence**: You can use the `formula` function to generate a geometric sequence by multiplying the previous number by a fixed constant.\n*   **Arithmetic Sequence**: You can modify the `formula` function to generate an arithmetic sequence by adding a fixed constant to the previous number.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to define a clear and well-documented `formula` function that accurately represents the sequence you want to generate.\n*   Choose appropriate `initial_value` and `max_value` parameters to control the length and range of the generated sequence.\n*   Consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure if you need to generate very large sequences.",
