  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and checks if it is a prime number. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given positive integer is a prime number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): A positive integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a positive integer\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Numbers less than 2 are not prime\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n\n    # 2 is the only even prime number\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n\n    # All other even numbers are not prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check for divisibility up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n\n    # If no divisors are found, the number is prime\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input validation**: The program first checks if the input `n` is a positive integer and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n2. **Special cases**: It then handles special cases, such as numbers less than 2 (not prime), the number 2 (the only even prime number), and all other even numbers (not prime).\n3. **Divisibility check**: The program checks for divisibility up to the square root of `n` using a loop that starts from 3 and increments by 2 (since all even numbers except 2 are not prime). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not a prime number.\n4. **Result**: If no divisors are found, the program returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Time complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(\u221an), which is a significant improvement over a naive approach that checks all numbers up to `n`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).",
