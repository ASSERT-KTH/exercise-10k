  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is the same as the original string (i.e., it's a palindrome). The program should print 'Yes' if the string is a palindrome and 'No' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that matches the provided specification:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    if s == s[::-1]:\n        print('Yes')\n    else:\n        print('No')\n\nis_palindrome(input())\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string `s` as input and checks if it's a palindrome. The function uses slicing (`s[::-1]`) to reverse the string and then compares the original string with the reversed string. If they're equal, it prints `'Yes'`; otherwise, it prints `'No'`. The function is then called with the result of `input()` as its argument.",
