  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing every other element from the original list, starting from the second element (index 1).",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef solve(numbers):\n    new_list = []\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers), 2):\n        new_list.append(numbers[i])\n    return new_list\n\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\nprint(solve(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `solve` that takes a list of integers as input, creates a new list `new_list` by iterating over the input list starting from the second element (index 1) and stepping by 2, and returns the new list. The list of integers `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]` is passed to the `solve` function, and the result is printed to the console.",
