  "answer": "### Even Number Filter Function\n#### Description\nThis function filters a list of integers to include only the even numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of integers to include only the even numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. Define a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers `numbers` as input.\n2. Use a list comprehension to create a new list `even_numbers` that includes only the numbers from the input list where `num % 2 == 0` (i.e., the even numbers).\n3. Return the `even_numbers` list.\n4. In the example usage, create a list `numbers` containing both even and odd integers.\n5. Call the `filter_even_numbers` function with the `numbers` list and print the resulting list of even numbers.",
