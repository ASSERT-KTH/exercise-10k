  "prompt": "Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the intersection between them, i.e., the key-value pairs that exist in both dictionaries.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to find the common key-value pairs between two dictionaries. This will involve creating a function that takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing their intersection. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef dictionary_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the intersection between two dictionaries.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the key-value pairs that exist in both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the intersection\n    intersection_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the first dictionary\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        \n        # Check if the key exists in the second dictionary and has the same value\n        if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value:\n            \n            # If the key-value pair exists in both dictionaries, add it to the intersection dictionary\n            intersection_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the intersection dictionary\n    return intersection_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nprint(dictionary_intersection(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `dictionary_intersection` initializes an empty dictionary `intersection_dict` to store the common key-value pairs from the input dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2`.\n* It iterates over each key-value pair in `dict1` using a for loop, checking if the key exists in `dict2` and if the corresponding values are equal.\n* If a matching key-value pair is found, it is added to `intersection_dict`.\n* Finally, the function returns `intersection_dict`, which contains the intersection of the two input dictionaries.",
