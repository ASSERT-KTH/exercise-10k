  "answer": "Here is a Python program that demonstrates the precedence of basic operators:\n\n```python\n# Arithmetic operators\nprint(\"Arithmetic Operators:\")\nprint(\"2 + 3 * 4 =\", 2 + 3 * 4)  # Expected output: 14\nprint(\"2 + 3 / 4 =\", 2 + 3 / 4)  # Expected output: 2.75\nprint(\"2 + 3 ** 4 =\", 2 + 3 ** 4)  # Expected output: 83\n\n# Comparison operators\nprint(\"\\nComparison Operators:\")\nprint(\"2 > 3 and 4 < 5 =\", 2 > 3 and 4 < 5)  # Expected output: False\nprint(\"2 > 3 or 4 < 5 =\", 2 > 3 or 4 < 5)  # Expected output: True\n\n# Logical operators\nprint(\"\\nLogical Operators:\")\nprint(\"True and False =\", True and False)  # Expected output: False\nprint(\"True or False =\", True or False)  # Expected output: True\nprint(\"not True =\", not True)  # Expected output: False\n\n# Precedence of logical operators\nprint(\"\\nPrecedence of Logical Operators:\")\nprint(\"True and False or True =\", True and False or True)  # Expected output: True\nprint(\"(True and False) or True =\", (True and False) or True)  # Expected output: True\nprint(\"True and (False or True) =\", True and (False or True))  # Expected output: True\n\n# Precedence of comparison operators\nprint(\"\\nPrecedence of Comparison Operators:\")\nprint(\"2 > 3 and 4 < 5 =\", 2 > 3 and 4 < 5)  # Expected output: False\nprint(\"(2 > 3) and (4 < 5) =\", (2 > 3) and (4 < 5))  # Expected output: False\nprint(\"2 > (3 and 4) < 5 =\", 2 > (3 and 4) < 5)  # Expected output: True\n\n# Precedence of arithmetic operators\nprint(\"\\nPrecedence of Arithmetic Operators:\")\nprint(\"2 + 3 * 4 =\", 2 + 3 * 4)  # Expected output: 14\nprint(\"(2 + 3) * 4 =\", (2 + 3) * 4)  # Expected output: 20\nprint(\"2 + (3 * 4) =\", 2 + (3 * 4))  # Expected output: 14\n```\n\nIn this program, we demonstrate the precedence of basic operators in Python. The operators are evaluated in the following order:\n\n*   Arithmetic operators: `**` (exponentiation), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction)\n*   Comparison operators: `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to)\n*   Logical operators: `and` (logical and), `or` (logical or), `not` (logical not)\n\nThe program includes examples that demonstrate the precedence of these operators, including cases where parentheses are used to change the order of evaluation.",
