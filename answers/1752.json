  "answer": "**Merging Two Sorted Arrays**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python solution to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n\n\ndef merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array (efficient version).\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new sorted array containing all elements from arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            result.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # Append the remaining elements, if any\n    result.extend(arr1[i:])\n    result.extend(arr2[j:])\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n    print(\"Sorted Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Sorted Array 2:\", arr2)\n\n    merged_array = merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Merged Sorted Array (simple):\", merged_array)\n\n    merged_array_efficient = merge_sorted_arrays_efficient(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Merged Sorted Array (efficient):\", merged_array_efficient)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nWe provide two solutions:\n\n1.  **Simple Solution (`merge_sorted_arrays` function):**\n\n    *   This function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).\n    *   It concatenates the two input arrays and then sorts the resulting array.\n2.  **Efficient Solution (`merge_sorted_arrays_efficient` function):**\n\n    *   This function has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays.\n    *   It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through the two input arrays, comparing elements and adding the smaller one to the result array.\n    *   Once one of the arrays is exhausted, it appends the remaining elements from the other array to the result.\n\nBoth solutions produce the same output, but the efficient solution is preferred for large input arrays due to its better time complexity.",
