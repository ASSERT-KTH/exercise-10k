  "answer": "### Football Points Calculator Function\n#### Description\nThis function calculates the total points earned by a football team based on the number of touchdowns, field goals, and extra points.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_football_points(touchdowns, field_goals, extra_points, two_point_conversions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total points earned by a football team.\n\n    Parameters:\n    touchdowns (int): Number of touchdowns scored.\n    field_goals (int): Number of field goals scored.\n    extra_points (int): Number of extra points scored.\n    two_point_conversions (int): Number of two-point conversions scored.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: Total points earned by the team.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Points per touchdown (including extra point)\n    TOUCHDOWN_POINTS = 7\n    # Points per field goal\n    FIELD_GOAL_POINTS = 3\n    # Points per extra point\n    EXTRA_POINT_POINTS = 1\n    # Points per two-point conversion\n    TWO_POINT_CONVERSION_POINTS = 2\n\n    # Calculate points from touchdowns\n    touchdown_points = touchdowns * TOUCHDOWN_POINTS\n    # Calculate points from field goals\n    field_goal_points = field_goals * FIELD_GOAL_POINTS\n    # Calculate points from extra points\n    extra_point_points = extra_points * EXTRA_POINT_POINTS\n    # Calculate points from two-point conversions\n    two_point_conversion_points = two_point_conversions * TWO_POINT_CONVERSION_POINTS\n\n    # Calculate total points\n    total_points = touchdown_points + field_goal_points + extra_point_points + two_point_conversion_points\n\n    return total_points\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    touchdowns = 3\n    field_goals = 2\n    extra_points = 1\n    two_point_conversions = 1\n    total_points = calculate_football_points(touchdowns, field_goals, extra_points, two_point_conversions)\n    print(f\"Total points earned: {total_points}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `calculate_football_points` function takes four parameters: `touchdowns`, `field_goals`, `extra_points`, and `two_point_conversions`.\n*   It calculates the points earned from each type of score and returns the total points earned by the team.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with sample values for touchdowns, field goals, extra points, and two-point conversions, and prints the total points earned.",
