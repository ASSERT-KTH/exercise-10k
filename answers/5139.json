  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence Program**\n=============================================\n\nHere's a Python solution using dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within a given array:\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position.\n    lengths = [1] * len(arr)\n\n    # Iterate over the array to fill the lengths list.\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], lengths[j] + 1)\n\n    # Return the maximum length found.\n    return max(lengths)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\n    print(\"Array:\", arr)\n    print(\"Length of the longest increasing subsequence:\", longest_increasing_subsequence(arr))\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1.  Initialize a list `lengths` to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position in the input array. Initialize all values to 1, as a single element is an increasing subsequence of length 1.\n2.  Iterate over the array, comparing each element with its predecessors. If the current element is greater than a predecessor, update the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current position if necessary.\n3.  After filling the `lengths` list, return the maximum length found, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we use two nested loops to iterate over the array.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position in the input array.",
