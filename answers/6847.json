  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one to calculate the area and another to calculate the perimeter. The user should be prompted to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then the program should display the calculated area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n\n    # Display the calculated area and perimeter\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area}\")\n    print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define two functions: `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`. These functions take the length and width of the rectangle as arguments and return the calculated area and perimeter, respectively.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, calls the `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter` functions, and displays the calculated area and perimeter.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rectangle_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rectangle_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and the program will display the calculated area and perimeter.",
