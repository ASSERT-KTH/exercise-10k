  "answer": "**Calculating Age from Birth Date and Current Date**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates a person's age given their birth date and the current date. This program takes into account leap years and accurately determines the age.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n\ndef calculate_age(birth_date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the age of a person given their birth date and the current date.\n\n    Args:\n        birth_date (date): The birth date of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The age of the person.\n    \"\"\"\n    today = date.today()\n    age = today.year - birth_date.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (birth_date.month, birth_date.day))\n    return age\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    birth_date = date(1990, 1, 1)  # Replace with the desired birth date\n    age = calculate_age(birth_date)\n    print(f\"The person's age is: {age} years\")\n\n    # Get birth date from user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter birth year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter birth month (1-12): \"))\n    day = int(input(\"Enter birth day (1-31): \"))\n\n    birth_date = date(year, month, day)\n    age = calculate_age(birth_date)\n    print(f\"The person's age is: {age} years\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_age` function takes a `birth_date` as input and calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n2. It then checks if the current month and day are less than the birth month and day. If they are, it subtracts 1 from the age to account for the person not having had their birthday yet this year.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_age` function with a hardcoded birth date and then prompts the user to enter a birth date.\n4. The program uses the `date` class from the `datetime` module to handle dates.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the age of a person born on January 1, 1990, on the current date.\n* Calculate the age of a person born on December 31, 2000, on the current date.\n* Prompt the user to enter a birth date and calculate the age based on the input.",
