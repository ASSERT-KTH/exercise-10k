  "answer": "**Secret Number Guessing Game**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess a secret number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef secret_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the Secret Number Guessing Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Keep asking the user for input until they guess the secret number\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing! The secret number was {}.\".format(secret_number))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == secret_number:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the secret number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    secret_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random secret number and prompt the user to guess.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will respond with a hint (e.g., \"Too low! Try again.\").\n4. The user can continue guessing until they find the secret number.\n5. If the user wants to quit, they can type \"quit\" to exit the game.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess the secret number or type \"quit\" to exit the game. The program also includes input validation to ensure the user enters a whole number.",
