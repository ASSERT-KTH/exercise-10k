  "answer": "### Calculating Average Age of Students in a Dictionary\n\nTo find the average age of students in a dictionary, you can follow these steps:\n\n#### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_age(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average age of students in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): Dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average age of the students.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the dictionary is empty\n    if not students:\n        return 0\n\n    # Calculate the sum of ages\n    total_age = sum(students.values())\n\n    # Calculate the average age\n    average_age = total_age / len(students)\n\n    return average_age\n\n\n# Example usage\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 21,\n    \"Charlie\": 19\n}\n\naverage_age = calculate_average_age(students)\nprint(f\"The average age of the students is: {average_age:.2f}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_average_age` that takes a dictionary `students` as input.\n2. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, return 0 as there are no students to calculate the average age for.\n3. Calculate the sum of ages using the `sum` function on the dictionary's values.\n4. Calculate the average age by dividing the sum of ages by the number of students (i.e., the length of the dictionary).\n5. Return the calculated average age.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example code, we create a dictionary `students` with four students and their corresponding ages. We then call the `calculate_average_age` function with this dictionary as input and print the result. The `:.2f` format specifier is used to round the average age to two decimal places.",
