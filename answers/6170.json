  "prompt": "Write a function that takes another function as input and applies it to a given value.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies another function to a given value, breaking down the solution into manageable parts for clarity. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes another function and a value as input\ndef apply_function(func, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to a given value.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        value: The value to which the function will be applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of applying the function to the value.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a function\n    if not callable(func):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input is not a function\")\n\n    # Apply the function to the value and return the result\n    # We use try-except block to catch any potential exceptions that might occur during function application\n    try:\n        # Apply the function to the value\n        result = func(value)\n        \n        # Return the result\n        return result\n    \n    # Catch and re-raise any exceptions that occur during function application\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise Exception(f\"An error occurred while applying the function: {str(e)}\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a simple function that squares a number\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Apply the square function to the value 5\nresult = apply_function(square, 5)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)  # Output: 25\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes two parameters: `func` (the function to be applied) and `value` (the value to which the function will be applied). It first checks if `func` is indeed a function using `callable(func)`.\n* If `func` is not a function, it raises a `TypeError` with an appropriate message. Otherwise, it attempts to apply `func` to `value` within a try-except block to catch any potential exceptions.\n* The result of applying `func` to `value` is stored in `result` and then returned. If an exception occurs during this process, it is caught and re-raised with a more informative error message.\n* An example usage is provided with the `square` function, demonstrating how to use `apply_function` to apply `square` to the value `5` and print the result.",
