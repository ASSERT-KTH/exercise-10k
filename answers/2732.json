  "answer": "**Most Frequent Element Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program finds the most frequent element in an array of integers. It uses a Python dictionary to count the frequency of each element and then returns the element with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef most_frequent_element(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most frequent element in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The most frequent element in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    freq = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the array and count the frequency of each element\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in freq:\n            freq[num] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[num] = 1\n\n    # Find the element with the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = max(freq.values())\n    most_frequent = [num for num, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]\n\n    # Return the most frequent element(s)\n    return most_frequent\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(most_frequent_element(arr))  # Output: [4]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `most_frequent_element` function takes an array of integers as input.\n2. It creates a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each element.\n3. It iterates over the array and counts the frequency of each element using the dictionary.\n4. It finds the maximum frequency using the `max` function.\n5. It returns a list of elements with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are using a dictionary to store the frequency of each element, which can grow up to the size of the input array in the worst case.",
