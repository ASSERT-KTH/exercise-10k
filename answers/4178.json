  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of player names and positions as input and prints the team roster.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define the team roster\nteam_roster = [\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"position\": \"Point Guard\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Tom\", \"position\": \"Shooting Guard\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Alex\", \"position\": \"Small Forward\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Sam\", \"position\": \"Power Forward\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Jack\", \"position\": \"Center\"}\n]\n\n# Define a function to print the team roster\ndef print_team_roster(roster):\n    print(\"\\nTeam Roster:\")\n    for player in roster:\n        print(f\"{player['name']}: {player['position']}\")\n\n# Print the team roster\nprint_team_roster(team_roster)\n```\n\nThis code defines a list of dictionaries representing the team roster, where each dictionary contains the player's name and position. The `print_team_roster` function takes the roster as input and prints each player's name and position. The program then calls this function with the predefined team roster.\n\nYou can modify the `team_roster` list to include your own players and their positions. Alternatively, you can create a function to input player data and add it to the roster.\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nTeam Roster:\nJohn: Point Guard\nTom: Shooting Guard\nAlex: Small Forward\nSam: Power Forward\nJack: Center\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Define the team roster as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a player with keys for \"name\" and \"position\".\n2. Create a function `print_team_roster` that takes the team roster as input.\n3. Within the function, print a header indicating the start of the team roster.\n4. Iterate over each player in the roster using a `for` loop.\n5. For each player, print their name and position using f-strings for formatting.\n6. Call the `print_team_roster` function with the predefined team roster as an argument.",
