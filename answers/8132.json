  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that validates an email address using if/else statements.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an email address.\n\n    Args:\n    email (str): The email address to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the email address is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Regular expression for validating an email\n    regex = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n\n    # Check if the email matches the regex\n    if re.match(regex, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the email address from the user\n    email = input(\"Enter your email address: \")\n\n    # Validate the email address\n    if validate_email(email):\n        print(\"The email address is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The email address is not valid. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   The program uses a regular expression (regex) to match the general pattern of an email address.\n*   The `validate_email` function takes an email address as input and checks if it matches the regex pattern.\n*   If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid.\n*   If the email address does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`, indicating that the email address is not valid.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter an email address, validates it using the `validate_email` function, and prints a message indicating whether the email address is valid or not.\n\n**Regex Pattern Explanation:**\n\n*   `\\b`: Word boundary to ensure the email address is a whole word and not part of another word.\n*   `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens. This is the local part of the email address (before the `@`).\n*   `@`: Matches the `@` symbol.\n*   `[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens. This is the domain name.\n*   `\\.`: Matches the dot (.) before the top-level domain.\n*   `[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`: Matches the top-level domain (it must be at least 2 characters long).\n*   `\\b`: Word boundary to ensure the email address is a whole word and not part of another word.\n\nThis regex pattern is a simplified version and may not cover all possible valid email addresses according to the official specification (RFC 5322). However, it should work for most common email addresses.",
