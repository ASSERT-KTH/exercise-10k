  "answer": "**First Missing Positive Integer Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a set to keep track of the positive integers in the array:\n\n```python\ndef first_missing_positive(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first missing positive integer in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first missing positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove non-positive integers and duplicates\n    num_set = set(num for num in nums if num > 0)\n\n    # Initialize the first missing positive integer to 1\n    missing = 1\n\n    # Iterate through the positive integers\n    while missing in num_set:\n        # If the current integer is in the set, increment it\n        missing += 1\n\n    return missing\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    # Test case 1: [1, 2, 0]\n    print(first_missing_positive([1, 2, 0]))  # Output: 3\n\n    # Test case 2: [3, 4, -1, 1]\n    print(first_missing_positive([3, 4, -1, 1]))  # Output: 2\n\n    # Test case 3: [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]\n    print(first_missing_positive([7, 8, 9, 11, 12]))  # Output: 1\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Remove non-positive integers and duplicates from the input array by creating a set of positive integers.\n2.  Initialize the first missing positive integer to 1.\n3.  Iterate through the positive integers, starting from 1.\n4.  If the current integer is in the set, increment it and continue the iteration.\n5.  The first integer that is not in the set is the first missing positive integer.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we are storing the positive integers in a set.",
