  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num_terms = 10\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:\")\n    print(fibonacci(num_terms))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: We define a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2.  **Base Cases**: We handle base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0 (returning an empty list), 1 (returning a list with 0), or 2 (returning a list with 0 and 1).\n3.  **Sequence Generation**: For `n` greater than 2, we initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms, `[0, 1]`. We then enter a loop that continues until the sequence has `n` terms. In each iteration, we append the sum of the last two terms to the sequence.\n4.  **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we demonstrate how to use the `fibonacci` function by generating the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms and printing the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms using a simple iterative approach.",
