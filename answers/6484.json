Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a character.\n3. The program will print the character back out.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses Python's built-in `input` function to read user input.\n* It checks if the input is a single character to ensure the program works as expected.\n* If the input is not a single character, it prints an error message. Otherwise, it prints the character back out.",
