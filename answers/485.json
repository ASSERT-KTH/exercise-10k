  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a target value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the array. If the target value is not found, return -1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the specified solution:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    int searchInsert(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {\n            if (nums[i] == target) {\n                return i;\n            }\n        }\n        return -1;\n    }\n};\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a single member function `searchInsert`, which takes three parameters: `nums`, `numsSize`, and `target`. The function iterates over the `nums` array and checks if each element is equal to the `target` value. If it finds a match, it returns the index of the match. If it reaches the end of the array without finding a match, it returns -1.\n\nNote that this code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` array, because it iterates over the entire array in the worst case.",
