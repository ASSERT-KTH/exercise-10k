  "answer": "### Boolean Variable and Conditional Statement Example\n\nBelow is an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to declare a boolean variable and use a conditional statement to print out a message based on the value.\n\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable\nis_admin = True\n\n# Use a conditional statement to print out a message\nif is_admin:\n    print(\"You are an administrator.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not an administrator.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We declare a boolean variable `is_admin` and assign it the value `True`.\n*   We use an `if-else` conditional statement to check the value of `is_admin`.\n*   If `is_admin` is `True`, the program prints \"You are an administrator.\"\n*   If `is_admin` is `False`, the program prints \"You are not an administrator.\"\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   You can modify the value of `is_admin` to `False` to see the alternative message.\n*   You can use this pattern in scenarios where you need to make decisions based on boolean conditions, such as user authentication or validation.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `boolean_example.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python boolean_example.py`) to see the output.",
