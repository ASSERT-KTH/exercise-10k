  "answer": "**Age Category Program**\n=========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program determines a person's age category based on their age. It uses if/else statements to categorize the age into the following groups:\n\n* Infant (0-1 year)\n* Toddler (2-3 years)\n* Preschooler (4-5 years)\n* School-age child (6-12 years)\n* Teenager (13-19 years)\n* Young adult (20-29 years)\n* Adult (30-64 years)\n* Senior citizen (65 years and above)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef determine_age_category(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the age category based on the given age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The age category.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age < 0:\n        return \"Invalid age\"\n    elif age <= 1:\n        return \"Infant\"\n    elif age <= 3:\n        return \"Toddler\"\n    elif age <= 5:\n        return \"Preschooler\"\n    elif age <= 12:\n        return \"School-age child\"\n    elif age <= 19:\n        return \"Teenager\"\n    elif age <= 29:\n        return \"Young adult\"\n    elif age <= 64:\n        return \"Adult\"\n    else:\n        return \"Senior citizen\"\n\ndef main():\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    category = determine_age_category(age)\n    print(f\"Your age category is: {category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter your age: 25\n  Your age category is: Young adult\n* Enter your age: 67\n  Your age category is: Senior citizen\n* Enter your age: 10\n  Your age category is: School-age child\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `determine_age_category` function takes an age as input and returns the corresponding age category.\n2. The function uses if/else statements to check the age and determine the category.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their age, calls the `determine_age_category` function, and prints the result.\n4. The program uses a simple and straightforward approach to determine the age category, making it easy to understand and maintain.",
