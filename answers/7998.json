The `longest_common_subsequence` function takes two input strings `str1` and `str2` and returns their longest common subsequence.\n2.  It uses a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences, where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`.\n3.  The 2D array is filled using dynamic programming, where each cell `dp[i][j]` is computed based on the values of the cells above and to the left of it.\n4.  If the current characters of `str1` and `str2` match, the length of the common subsequence is incremented by 1.\n5.  Otherwise, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum of the lengths of the subsequences without the current character of `str1` or `str2`.\n6.  The longest common subsequence is reconstructed from the 2D array by tracing back the path from the bottom-right cell to the top-left cell.\n7.  The example usage demonstrates how to call the `longest_common_subsequence` function with two input strings and print the resulting longest common subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the `longest_common_subsequence` function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the `longest_common_subsequence` function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.",
