  "answer": "**Guessing Game Program**\n=========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a while loop to play a guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and start guessing numbers between 1 and 100.\n* Type \"quit\" to exit the game.\n* The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and will congratulate you when you find the correct number.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is valid (i.e. a whole number between 1 and 100) and provides feedback if it's not.\n4. If the user's guess is valid, the program checks if it's correct, and provides feedback if it's not.\n5. The program keeps track of the number of attempts the user has made, and congratulates the user when they find the correct number.",
