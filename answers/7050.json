  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Simulator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between two players. The game can be played in two modes: single-player (against the computer) or multi-player (between two human players).\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_move():\n    \"\"\"Returns a random move from the computer.\"\"\"\n    moves = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(moves)\n\ndef get_user_move():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their move and returns it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if move in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return move\n        print(\"Invalid move. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(player1_move, player2_move):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the moves of the two players.\"\"\"\n    if player1_move == player2_move:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (player1_move == 'rock' and player2_move == 'scissors') or \\\n       (player1_move == 'scissors' and player2_move == 'paper') or \\\n       (player1_move == 'paper' and player2_move == 'rock'):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef play_single_player():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.\"\"\"\n    user_move = get_user_move()\n    computer_move = get_computer_move()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_move}, computer chose {computer_move}.\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_move, computer_move))\n\ndef play_multi_player():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between two human players.\"\"\"\n    player1_move = get_user_move()\n    player2_move = get_user_move()\n    print(f\"\\nPlayer 1 chose {player1_move}, Player 2 chose {player2_move}.\")\n    print(determine_winner(player1_move, player2_move))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user to choose a game mode and starts the game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nChoose a game mode:\")\n        print(\"1. Play against the computer\")\n        print(\"2. Play against another player\")\n        print(\"3. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, or 3): \")\n        if choice == '1':\n            play_single_player()\n        elif choice == '2':\n            play_multi_player()\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose a game mode:\n\t* Play against the computer (1)\n\t* Play against another player (2)\n\t* Quit (3)\n3. Follow the prompts to enter your move.\n4. The program will display the moves of both players and determine the winner.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to simulate the computer's move. In a real-world application, you may want to use a more secure random number generator.",
