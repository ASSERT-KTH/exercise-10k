  "answer": "**MPG Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the miles per gallon (MPG) of a vehicle based on the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mpg(distance, fuel_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the miles per gallon (MPG) of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.\n        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed in gallons.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The miles per gallon (MPG) of the vehicle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumed == 0:\n        return 0\n    mpg = distance / fuel_consumed\n    return mpg\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"MPG Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed in gallons: \"))\n\n    mpg = calculate_mpg(distance, fuel_consumed)\n\n    print(f\"MPG: {mpg:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the MPG of a vehicle that traveled 250 miles and consumed 10 gallons of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 250`, `fuel_consumed = 10`\n\t+ Output: `MPG: 25.00`\n* Calculate the MPG of a vehicle that traveled 500 miles and consumed 20 gallons of fuel:\n\t+ Input: `distance = 500`, `fuel_consumed = 20`\n\t+ Output: `MPG: 25.00`\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `mpg_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program using the command `python mpg_calculator.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n5. The program will calculate and display the MPG of the vehicle.",
