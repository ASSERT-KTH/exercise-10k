  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the price after tax is added given the original price and the tax percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_price_after_tax(original_price, tax_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the price after tax is added.\n\n    Args:\n    - original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n    - tax_percentage (float): The tax percentage as a decimal (e.g. 8% = 0.08).\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The price after tax is added.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = original_price * tax_percentage\n    price_after_tax = original_price + tax_amount\n    return price_after_tax\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the original price and tax percentage from the user\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: $\"))\n    tax_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tax percentage (e.g. 8 for 8%): \")) / 100\n\n    # Calculate the price after tax\n    price_after_tax = calculate_price_after_tax(original_price, tax_percentage)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax Percentage: {tax_percentage * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Price after Tax: ${price_after_tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the original price (e.g. `100`).\n3. Enter the tax percentage (e.g. `8` for 8%).\n4. The program will calculate and print the price after tax.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The tax percentage is converted to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n* The `calculate_price_after_tax` function takes two arguments: `original_price` and `tax_percentage`.\n* The `main` function gets the user input, calls the `calculate_price_after_tax` function, and prints the result.\n* The price after tax is calculated by multiplying the original price by the tax percentage and adding the result to the original price.",
