  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and calculates the result. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef calculate(num1, num2, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif op == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif op == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif op == '/':\n        result = num1 / num2\n    return result\n\nnum1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))\nop = input('Enter the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /): ')\nnum2 = float(input('Enter the second number: '))\n\nresult = calculate(num1, num2, op)\nprint('The result is:', result)\n```\nThis code follows the specification exactly, with the encoding comment, function definition, input, calculation, and output as described. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
