  "answer": "**Dictionary Lookup Program**\n================================\n\nThis program uses the `requests` library to fetch data from a dictionary API and the `json` library to parse the response.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef get_definition(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Looks up a word in the dictionary and returns its definition.\n    \n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to look up.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The definition of the word.\n    \"\"\"\n    api_url = f\"https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}\"\n    response = requests.get(api_url)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        definition = data[0][\"meanings\"][0][\"definitions\"][0][\"definition\"]\n        return definition\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    definition = get_definition(word)\n    \n    if definition:\n        print(f\"The definition of '{word}' is: {definition}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, no definition found for '{word}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_definition` function takes a word as input and sends a GET request to the dictionary API.\n2. The response is parsed as JSON and the definition of the word is extracted.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a word, calls `get_definition` to fetch the definition, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `dictionary_lookup.py`.\n2. Run the program using `python dictionary_lookup.py`.\n3. Enter a word when prompted, e.g., \"hello\".\n4. The program will print the definition of the word.\n\nNote: This program uses a free dictionary API that may have usage limits. Be sure to check the API documentation for more information.",
