  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses a while loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1. The output should be on separate lines.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfor x in range(1, 11):\n    print(x)\n\ni = 10\nwhile i >= 1:\n    print(i)\n    i = i - 1\n```\nThis code uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and a `while` loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1. The output will be:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```",
