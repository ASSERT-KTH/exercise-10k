  "answer": "**Program Description**\n========================\n\nThis program uses Python to take user input and respond with a pre-defined response based on the input. It utilizes a dictionary to map user inputs to corresponding responses.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to map user inputs to responses\nresponses = {\n    \"hello\": \"Hello! How are you today?\",\n    \"goodbye\": \"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\",\n    \"how are you\": \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\",\n    \"what's your name\": \"My name is ChatBot.\",\n    \"default\": \"I didn't understand that. Please try again.\"\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a pre-defined response based on the user input.\n    \n    Args:\n        user_input (str): The user's input.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding response.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    \n    # Check if the user input matches a key in the responses dictionary\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return responses[key]\n    \n    # If no match is found, return the default response\n    return responses[\"default\"]\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        \n        if user_input.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        \n        response = get_response(user_input)\n        print(\"ChatBot:\", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* User inputs \"hello\" and the program responds with \"Hello! How are you today?\"\n* User inputs \"goodbye\" and the program responds with \"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\"\n* User inputs \"what's up\" and the program responds with \"I didn't understand that. Please try again.\" (since \"what's up\" is not a predefined key)\n* User inputs \"quit\" and the program exits\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `chatbot.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Type `python chatbot.py` to run the program.\n4. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages, and the program will respond accordingly. Type \"quit\" to exit the program.",
