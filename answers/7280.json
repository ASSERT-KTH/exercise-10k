  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course. The function should take in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course. The grades can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F', and the credits can be any positive integer. The GPA is calculated by multiplying the grade point for each course by its credit, summing these products, and then dividing by the total number of credits.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course. This response will provide a step-by-step solution to achieve this. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades_and_credits):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade point average (GPA) of a student given their grades and credits for each course.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_and_credits (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course.\n            The grades can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F', and the credits can be any positive integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The GPA of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a dictionary to map grades to their corresponding grade points\n    grade_points = {'A': 4, 'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'D': 1, 'F': 0}\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the total grade points and the total credits\n    total_grade_points = 0\n    total_credits = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each course in the list of grades and credits\n    for grade, credit in grades_and_credits:\n        # Check if the grade is valid\n        if grade not in grade_points:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid grade. Grade must be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.\")\n\n        # Check if the credit is valid\n        if not isinstance(credit, int) or credit <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid credit. Credit must be a positive integer.\")\n\n        # Calculate the grade points for the current course by multiplying the grade point by the credit\n        course_grade_points = grade_points[grade] * credit\n        \n        # Add the grade points for the current course to the total grade points\n        total_grade_points += course_grade_points\n        \n        # Add the credit for the current course to the total credits\n        total_credits += credit\n\n    # Check if there are any credits\n    if total_credits == 0:\n        # If there are no credits, return 0 as the GPA\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Calculate the GPA by dividing the total grade points by the total credits\n        gpa = total_grade_points / total_credits\n        \n        # Return the calculated GPA\n        return gpa\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_gpa` takes a list of tuples `grades_and_credits` as input, where each tuple contains the grade and credit for a course. It initializes a dictionary `grade_points` to map grades to their corresponding grade points.\n*   It iterates over each course in `grades_and_credits`, checks if the grade and credit are valid, and calculates the grade points for the current course by multiplying the grade point by the credit.\n*   The function then calculates the GPA by dividing the total grade points by the total credits and returns the result. If there are no credits, it returns 0 as the GPA.",
