  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operation can be one of the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, the program should output an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n```\nimport sys\n\n# Checking if the user has provided the correct number of command line arguments\nif len(sys.argv) != 4:\n    print('Usage: python program.py <number1> <operation> <number2>')\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Reading the command line arguments\nnum1 = float(sys.argv[1])\noperation = sys.argv[2]\nnum2 = float(sys.argv[3])\n\n# Checking if the operation is valid\nif operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Performing the arithmetic operation\nif operation == 'addition':\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operation == 'subtraction':\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operation == 'multiplication':\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operation == 'division':\n    if num2 == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    else:\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n# Printing the result\nprint('Result:', result)\n```\nThis code follows the provided specifications and handles the command line arguments, operation validation, and arithmetic operations as described. It also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operations.",
