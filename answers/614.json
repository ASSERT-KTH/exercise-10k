  "answer": "**Sales Tax Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the sales tax on a given purchase amount and tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sales_tax(purchase_amount, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sales tax on a given purchase amount and tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        purchase_amount (float): The amount of the purchase.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sales tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    sales_tax = purchase_amount * tax_rate\n    return sales_tax\n\ndef main():\n    purchase_amount = float(input(\"Enter the purchase amount: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 8 for 8%): \")) / 100\n\n    sales_tax = calculate_sales_tax(purchase_amount, tax_rate)\n    total_amount = purchase_amount + sales_tax\n\n    print(f\"Purchase Amount: ${purchase_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tax Rate: {tax_rate * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Sales Tax: ${sales_tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the purchase amount (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the tax rate (e.g., 8 for 8%).\n4. The program will display the sales tax amount and the total amount.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nEnter the purchase amount: $100\nEnter the tax rate (as a percentage, e.g., 8 for 8%): 8\nPurchase Amount: $100.00\nTax Rate: 8.0%\nSales Tax: $8.00\nTotal Amount: $108.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple formula to calculate the sales tax: `sales_tax = purchase_amount * tax_rate`.\n* The `calculate_sales_tax` function takes two arguments: `purchase_amount` and `tax_rate`.\n* The `main` function prompts the user for input, calculates the sales tax, and displays the results.\n* The program uses the `float` data type to handle decimal numbers.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to display the results with two decimal places.",
