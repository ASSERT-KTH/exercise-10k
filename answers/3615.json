  "answer": "**Sorting a List of Numbers using a Lambda Function**\n\nHere's an example of a Python function that uses a lambda function to sort a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n    num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(num_list, key=lambda x: x)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function called `sort_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n*   Inside the function, we use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list of numbers.\n*   The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function that simply returns each number (`x`) in the list. This tells the `sorted` function to sort the numbers based on their values.\n*   Finally, we return the sorted list of numbers.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nIn this example, the lambda function is used to specify the sorting key for the `sorted` function. The lambda function simply returns each number in the list, which allows the `sorted` function to sort the numbers based on their values.\n\nNote that in this case, using a lambda function is not strictly necessary, as the `sorted` function can sort a list of numbers without any additional key function. However, using a lambda function can be useful when you need to sort a list of more complex objects based on a specific attribute or property.",
