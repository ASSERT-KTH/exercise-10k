  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a string as input and checks if it contains only letters, numbers, and spaces. The function should return 'Valid' if the string meets the criteria, and 'Invalid' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that checks if a given string contains only letters, numbers, and spaces, and provide a clear explanation of the solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given string contains only letters, numbers, and spaces.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: 'Valid' if the string meets the criteria, 'Invalid' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We'll use the all() function in combination with a generator expression to check each character in the string.\n    # The all() function returns True if all elements of the iterable are true, and False otherwise.\n    # The generator expression will iterate over each character in the string.\n    return 'Valid' if all(\n        \n        # For each character in the string, we'll use the isalnum() method to check if it's a letter or a number, \n        # or the isspace() method to check if it's a space.\n        # The or operator will ensure that we're checking for either condition.\n        c.isalnum() or c.isspace() \n        \n        # This loop will iterate over each character in the string.\n        for c in s\n    ) else 'Invalid'\n\n# Test the function\nprint(check_string(\"Hello World123\"))  # Should return 'Valid'\nprint(check_string(\"Hello World123!\"))  # Should return 'Invalid'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_string` takes a string `s` as input and uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check each character in the string.\n* Inside the generator expression, the `isalnum()` method checks if a character is a letter or a number, and the `isspace()` method checks if it's a space. The `or` operator ensures that either condition is met.\n* The `all()` function returns `True` if all characters in the string meet the criteria, and `False` otherwise. This result is then used to return either `'Valid'` or `'Invalid'`.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier to understand and use.",
