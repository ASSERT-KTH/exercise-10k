  "prompt": "Write a program that demonstrates dynamic typing (e.g., changing the data type of a variable).",
  "answer": "Here's an example of dynamic typing in Python. Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time.\n\n```python\n# Dynamic Typing Example in Python\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize a variable with an integer value\n    my_variable = 10\n    print(\"Initial type and value:\", type(my_variable), my_variable)\n\n    # Change the type to float\n    my_variable = 10.5\n    print(\"Type changed to float:\", type(my_variable), my_variable)\n\n    # Change the type to string\n    my_variable = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Type changed to string:\", type(my_variable), my_variable)\n\n    # Change the type to list\n    my_variable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(\"Type changed to list:\", type(my_variable), my_variable)\n\n    # Change the type to dictionary\n    my_variable = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n    print(\"Type changed to dictionary:\", type(my_variable), my_variable)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this example, we start with an integer value, then change the type to float, string, list, and dictionary, demonstrating the dynamic typing capabilities of Python.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nInitial type and value: <class 'int'> 10\nType changed to float: <class 'float'> 10.5\nType changed to string: <class 'str'> Hello, World!\nType changed to list: <class 'list'> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nType changed to dictionary: <class 'dict'> {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\n```\n\nThis example showcases the flexibility of dynamic typing in Python, allowing us to change the data type of a variable at runtime.",
