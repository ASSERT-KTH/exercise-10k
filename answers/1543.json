  "answer": "### Filtering Even Numbers from a List\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `filter_even_numbers`, takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list of integers and return a new list containing only the even numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list (`even_numbers`) containing only the numbers from the input list (`numbers`) that satisfy the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which checks if a number is even.\n*   The function returns the `even_numbers` list.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `filter_even_numbers` with an example list of numbers and print the resulting list of even numbers.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```",
