  "prompt": "Create a function called calculator that takes in two numbers and an operation as input. The operation can be either 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'. The function should then perform the operation on the two numbers and return the result.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers, helping you understand how to structure the code and handle different operations. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The operation to be performed. It can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is 'divide' and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Operation must be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\")\n\n    # Then, we perform the operation based on the input\n    # For addition, we simply add the two numbers\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    \n    # For subtraction, we subtract the second number from the first\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    \n    # For multiplication, we multiply the two numbers\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    \n    # For division, we divide the first number by the second\n    # We also need to check for division by zero\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculator(10, 2, 'add'))  # Output: 12\nprint(calculator(10, 2, 'subtract'))  # Output: 8\nprint(calculator(10, 2, 'multiply'))  # Output: 20\nprint(calculator(10, 2, 'divide'))  # Output: 5.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculator` takes in three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`, and first checks if the `operation` is valid. If not, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.\n* It then uses an if-elif-else structure to perform the specified `operation` on `num1` and `num2`. For the 'divide' operation, it also checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `num2` is zero.\n* The function returns the result of the operation, which can be used directly or stored in a variable for further use.\n* Example usage is provided to demonstrate how to call the `calculator` function with different operations and numbers, showcasing its functionality.",
