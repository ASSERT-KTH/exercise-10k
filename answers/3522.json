  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that prints a given string in reverse order using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_reverse_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a given string in reverse order using a while loop.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The string to be reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = len(input_str) - 1  # Initialize the index to the last character\n    while i >= 0:  # Continue until the index is less than 0\n        print(input_str[i], end='')  # Print the character at the current index\n        i -= 1  # Decrement the index\n\n# Example usage\ninput_str = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(\"Original string: \", input_str)\nprint(\"Reversed string: \", end='')\nprint_reverse_string(input_str)\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1.  The `print_reverse_string` function takes an input string and initializes a variable `i` to the index of the last character in the string.\n2.  It then enters a while loop, which continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.\n3.  Inside the loop, it prints the character at the current index `i` without adding a newline character at the end (`end=''`).\n4.  After printing the character, it decrements the index `i` by 1, effectively moving to the previous character in the string.\n5.  Once the loop finishes (i.e., `i` becomes less than 0), the function ends, and the reversed string has been printed.\n\nWhen you run this program with the example string \"Hello, World!\", it will print the original string and its reversed version.",
