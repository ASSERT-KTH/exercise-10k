  "answer": "Here's a simple program written in Python that performs the task:\n\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division and remainder.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and the remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the divisor is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    \n    # Perform the division and calculate the remainder\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    try:\n        dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n        \n        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        \n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `divide_and_remainder` that takes two parameters, `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2.  We check if the `divisor` is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError. If it is zero, we raise an exception.\n3.  We use the `//` operator to perform integer division and get the quotient, and the `%` operator to get the remainder.\n4.  We return the quotient and remainder as a tuple.\n5.  In the `main` function, we take the dividend and divisor as input from the user and call the `divide_and_remainder` function with these values.\n6.  We print the result of the division and the remainder.\n7.  We handle any ZeroDivisionError that may occur during the division.",
