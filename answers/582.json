  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   Inside the function, we first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because we cannot calculate the average of an empty list.\n*   If the list is not empty, we use the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list and the built-in `len` function to get the count of numbers in the list. We then divide the sum by the count to get the average.\n*   Finally, we return the calculated average.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we are iterating over all elements in the list once to calculate the sum.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input list. This is because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the sum and the count of numbers.",
