  "prompt": "Write a program that evaluates a given condition and returns a corresponding message. The program should ask for the user's age and then check if they are eligible to vote (age >= 18). If eligible, it should print 'You are eligible to vote.' Otherwise, it should print 'You are not eligible to vote.'",
  "answer": "Here's the code that matches the given specification:\n\n```python\n# Importing Modules\nimport sys\n\n# Defining the Function\ndef main():\n    # Getting User Input\n    age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n    age = int(age)\n\n    # Checking Eligibility\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n# Running the Program\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code imports the `sys` module (although it's not used in this example), defines the `main()` function, gets user input, checks the eligibility based on the age, and prints the corresponding message. The `main()` function is then called to run the program.",
