  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount using coins of different denominations.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution using dynamic programming to find the minimum number of coins required:\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n\n# Test the function\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nresult = min_coins(coins, amount)\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Minimum number of coins required to make {amount} is {result}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Cannot make {amount} with the given coins.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We create a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` of size `amount + 1` and initialize all values to infinity, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 (since we need 0 coins to make 0 amount).\n*   We then iterate through each coin denomination.\n*   For each coin, we iterate through the amounts from the coin value to the target amount.\n*   We update `dp[i]` with the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the current amount `i` by either not using the current coin or using it.\n*   Finally, we return `dp[amount]` as the minimum number of coins required to make the target amount. If `dp[amount]` remains infinity, it means that we cannot make the target amount with the given coins, so we return -1.\n\n**Time complexity:** O(amount \\* len(coins))\n\n**Space complexity:** O(amount)",
