  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the multiplication table of a given number:\n\n```python\n# Function to print the multiplication table\ndef print_multiplication_table(num):\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{num} x {i} = {num * i}\")\n\n# Get user input\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Print the multiplication table\nprint_multiplication_table(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user to enter a number.\n2. **Function Definition**: A function `print_multiplication_table(num)` is defined, which takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table.\n3. **Multiplication Table**: Inside the function, a `for` loop is used to iterate from 1 to 10. For each iteration, the program prints the multiplication of the input number with the current iteration number.\n4. **Function Call**: The function is called with the user's input number, and the multiplication table is printed.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```\n\nThis program can be used to print the multiplication table of any number. You can modify the range in the `for` loop to print the multiplication table up to a different number.",
