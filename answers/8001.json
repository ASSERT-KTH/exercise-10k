Please update their grade instead.\")\n    else:\n        student_grades[name] = grade\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n\ndef update_grade():\n    \"\"\"Update the grade of an existing student\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    \n    # Check if the student exists\n    if name in student_grades:\n        grade = float(input(\"Enter the new grade: \"))\n        student_grades[name] = grade\n        print(f\"Grade of '{name}' updated successfully.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Student does not exist. Please add them first.\")\n\ndef display_grades():\n    \"\"\"Display all student grades\"\"\"\n    if not student_grades:\n        print(\"No students in the database.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nStudent Grades:\")\n        for name, grade in student_grades.items():\n            print(f\"{name}: {grade}\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nStudent Gradebook Menu:\")\n        print(\"1.

Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses a dictionary `student_grades` to store student names as keys and their grades as values. The program provides the following functionalities:\n\n*   `add_student()`: Adds a new student to the dictionary with their grade.\n*   `update_grade()`: Updates the grade of an existing student.\n*   `display_grades()`: Displays all student grades.\n*   `main()`: Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program.\n\nThe program initializes the `student_grades` dictionary with a set of students and their grades. The `main()` function runs an infinite loop, presenting the user with a menu to choose from. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the desired action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display a menu with options to add a student, update a grade, display grades, or exit the program. Here's an example interaction:\n\n```\nStudent Gradebook Menu:\n1. Add Student\n2. Update Grade\n3. Display Grades\n4. Exit\nEnter your choice: 1\nEnter the student's name: Emily\nEnter the student's grade: 95\nStudent 'Emily' added successfully.\n\nStudent Gradebook Menu:\n1. Add Student\n2. Update Grade\n3. Display Grades\n4. Exit\nEnter your choice: 3\n\nStudent Grades:\nJohn: 85\nAlice: 90\nBob: 78\nCharlie: 92\nDavid: 88\nEmily: 95\n```",
