  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for the current temperature and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the temperature is above 25, print 'It's hot outside'; if the temperature is between 15 and 25, print 'It's mild outside'; if the temperature is below 15, print 'It's cold outside'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef get_temperature_message():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for the current temperature and prints a message based on the temperature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for the current temperature\n    temperature = float(input(\"Please enter the current temperature: \"))\n\n    # Determine the message based on the temperature\n    if temperature > 25:\n        message = \"It's hot outside\"\n    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:\n        message = \"It's mild outside\"\n    else:\n        message = \"It's cold outside\"\n\n    # Print the message\n    print(message)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Call the function to get the temperature message\n    get_temperature_message()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. The `get_temperature_message` function asks the user for the current temperature using the `input` function.\n2. It then determines the message based on the temperature using an `if-elif-else` statement.\n3. If the temperature is above 25, it sets the message to \"It's hot outside\".\n4. If the temperature is between 15 and 25 (inclusive), it sets the message to \"It's mild outside\".\n5. If the temperature is below 15, it sets the message to \"It's cold outside\".\n6. Finally, it prints the message using the `print` function.\n7. The `main` function calls the `get_temperature_message` function to start the program.\n8. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* If the user enters a temperature of 30, the program will print \"It's hot outside\".\n* If the user enters a temperature of 20, the program will print \"It's mild outside\".\n* If the user enters a temperature of 10, the program will print \"It's cold outside\".",
