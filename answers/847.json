  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function that applies each function in the list to its input.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies each function in a given list to its input, providing a step-by-step solution and explanation. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(functions):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function \n    that applies each function in the list to its input.\n\n    Args:\n        functions (list): A list of functions.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that applies each function in the list to its input.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We define a new function inside our compose_functions function. This new function \n    # will be returned by compose_functions and will apply each function in the list \n    # to its input.\n    def composed_function(input_value):\n        \n        # We initialize the output of our composed function with the input value.\n        output = input_value\n        \n        # We iterate over each function in the list of functions.\n        for func in functions:\n            \n            # For each function, we apply it to the current output and update the output.\n            output = func(output)\n        \n        # After applying all functions, we return the final output.\n        return output\n    \n    # We return the composed function.\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nfunctions = [double, add_one, square]\ncomposed = compose_functions(functions)\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 121\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function, `composed_function`, which applies each function in the list to its input.\n* Inside `composed_function`, we initialize the `output` variable with the input value and then iterate over each function in the list, applying it to the current `output` and updating the `output` variable.\n* The `composed_function` is then returned by `compose_functions` and can be used to apply the composed functions to an input value.\n* In the example usage, we define three functions (`double`, `add_one`, and `square`), compose them using `compose_functions`, and then apply the composed function to an input value, demonstrating the functionality of the solution.",
