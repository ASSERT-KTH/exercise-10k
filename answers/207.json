  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates a student's grade based on their score. The grade is determined by the following scale:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    score = 85\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"A score of {score} corresponds to a grade of {grade}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a single argument `score`, which is the student's score.\n2. The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function with an example score.\n4. The grade is printed to the console.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to validate the input score to ensure it is within the valid range (0-100).\n* Consider adding more grade levels or modifying the existing grade scale to suit your specific needs.\n* You can also add error handling to handle cases where the input score is not a number or is outside the valid range.",
