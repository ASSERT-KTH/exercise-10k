  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that calculates the area of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the area\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_rectangle_area` to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The `main` function gets the length and width from the user, calculates the area, and prints it out. \n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `rectangle_area.py`) and run it from the command line with Python (e.g., `python rectangle_area.py`). When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then it will print out the area.",
