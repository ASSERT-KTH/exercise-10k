  "prompt": "Write a program that rotates an array to the right by a specified number of positions. The program should take two inputs: the array and the number of positions to rotate. The rotation should be done in-place, meaning that the original array should be modified.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef rotate_array(nums, k):\n    k %= len(nums)\n    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nk = 3\nrotate_array(nums, k)\nprint(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\nThis code defines the `rotate_array` function, which takes two inputs: `nums` (the array to be rotated) and `k` (the number of positions to rotate). The function calculates the effective number of positions to rotate by taking the modulus of `k` with the length of the array, to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array. It then uses slice assignment to rotate the array in-place, by assigning the concatenation of the last `k` elements and the first `len(nums) - k` elements back to the original array. Finally, the example usage demonstrates the function's behavior by rotating an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` three positions to the right, resulting in the output `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.",
