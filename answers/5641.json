  "answer": "**Math Operation Function**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers based on a given operator.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef math_operation(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to use. Can be +, -, *, or /.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of +, -, *, or /.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is / and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operators to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        '/': lambda x, y: x / y\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operator is valid\n    if operator not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Must be +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation and return the result\n    return operations[operator](num1, num2)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\n    print(math_operation(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `math_operation` function takes in two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator as input.\n*   It defines a dictionary `operations` that maps each operator to its corresponding lambda function.\n*   It checks if the operator is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n*   It checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `num2` is 0 and the operator is /.\n*   Finally, it performs the operation by looking up the operator in the `operations` dictionary and returns the result.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with two numbers and an operator as arguments, like `math_operation(10, 2, '+')`. The function will return the result of the operation.",
