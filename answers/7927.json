  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the result of raising a number to a power:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of raising a number to a power.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The power to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and exponent from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the result\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `power` function takes two arguments, `base` and `exponent`, and returns the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent`.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to input a base and an exponent, calculates the result using the `power` function, and then prints the result.\n*   The `**` operator is used to calculate the power, which is a built-in operator in Python.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate 2 raised to the power of 3: `power(2, 3)` returns `8.0`\n*   Calculate 4 raised to the power of 0.5: `power(4, 0.5)` returns `2.0`\n*   Calculate -2 raised to the power of 2: `power(-2, 2)` returns `4.0`\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to handle potential errors, such as non-numeric inputs or division by zero.\n*   Consider adding input validation to ensure that the base and exponent are valid numbers.\n*   You can modify the program to calculate other mathematical operations, such as multiplication or division, by using the corresponding operators (`*` or `/`).",
