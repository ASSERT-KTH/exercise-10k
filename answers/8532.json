  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the total cost of an item after applying a tax rate.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to calculate the total cost of an item after applying a tax rate.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate total cost after tax\ndef calculate_total_cost(item_cost, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of an item after applying a tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        item_cost (float): The cost of the item.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the item after tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert tax rate from percentage to decimal\n    tax_rate_decimal = tax_rate / 100\n\n    # Calculate tax amount\n    tax_amount = item_cost * tax_rate_decimal\n\n    # Calculate total cost\n    total_cost = item_cost + tax_amount\n\n    return total_cost\n\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get item cost from user\n    item_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the item: \"))\n\n    # Get tax rate from user\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate (in %): \"))\n\n    # Calculate total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(item_cost, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print total cost\n    print(f\"The total cost of the item after tax is: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the item (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the tax rate (e.g., 8).\n4. The program will display the total cost of the item after tax (e.g., 108.00).\n\nThis program defines a `calculate_total_cost` function that takes the item cost and tax rate as input and returns the total cost. The `main` function gets the item cost and tax rate from the user, calls the `calculate_total_cost` function, and prints the result.",
