  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 and prints each number and its square. If the number is even, also print its double.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i, i ** 2)\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i * 2)\n```\nThis code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers 1 to 10, prints each number and its square, and checks if the number is even. If it is, it prints the number multiplied by 2. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
