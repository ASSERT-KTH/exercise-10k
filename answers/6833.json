  "prompt": "Create a program that prompts the user for their name and age, then prints out a personalized greeting message including their name and age, and also tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Prompt the user for their name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    return name, age\n\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a personalized greeting message.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.\")\n    print(f\"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program consists of three functions:\n\n1.  `get_user_info()`: This function prompts the user to enter their name and age. It uses a `while` loop to ensure that the age entered is a valid integer.\n2.  `print_greeting()`: This function takes the user's name and age as input and prints out a personalized greeting message, including their current age and their age in 5 years.\n3.  `main()`: This is the main function that calls `get_user_info()` to get the user's information and then calls `print_greeting()` to print the greeting message.\n\nThe program uses an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 25\nHello, John! You are currently 25 years old.\nIn 5 years, you will be 30 years old.\n```",
