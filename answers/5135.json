  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate Element in an Array**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven an array of integers, find the first duplicate element.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a dictionary to keep track of the elements we've seen so far:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate element in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate element if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\narr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements we've seen so far.\n2. We iterate through the input array `arr`.\n3. For each element `num`, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, we return `num` as the first duplicate element.\n5. If not, we add `num` to the `seen` set.\n6. If we reach the end of the array without finding a duplicate, we return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we're doing a single pass through the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
