  "answer": "**Bank Account Balance Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the balance of a bank account based on a series of transactions.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n        self.transactions = []\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        self.transactions.append((\"Deposit\", amount))\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            self.transactions.append((\"Withdrawal\", amount))\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n    def get_transactions(self):\n        return self.transactions\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initial balance of $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1.

It allows users to deposit, withdraw, check the balance, view transactions, or exit the program.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1.  Run the program and select option 1 to deposit $500.\n2.  Select option 2 to withdraw $200.\n3.  Select option 3 to check the current balance.\n4.  Select option 4 to view the transaction history.\n5.  Select option 5 to exit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not persist data. In a real-world application, you would want to use a more robust interface and store data in a secure database.",
