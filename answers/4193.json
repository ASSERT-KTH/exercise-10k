  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates a word scramble game by selecting a random word from a predefined list, shuffling its letters, and providing the user with the scrambled letters to unscramble.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_word_scramble(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a word scramble game.\n\n    Args:\n        words (list): A list of words to choose from.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the scrambled word and the original word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    original_word = random.choice(words)\n    \n    # Convert the word to a list of letters\n    letters = list(original_word)\n    \n    # Shuffle the letters\n    scrambled_word = ''.join(random.sample(letters, len(letters)))\n    \n    return scrambled_word, original_word\n\ndef play_word_scramble(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Plays a word scramble game.\n\n    Args:\n        words (list): A list of words to choose from.\n    \"\"\"\n    scrambled_word, original_word = generate_word_scramble(words)\n    \n    print(f\"Unscramble the letters: {scrambled_word}\")\n    \n    # Ask the user for their answer\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    \n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    if user_answer.lower() == original_word.lower():\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {original_word}.\")\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\nplay_word_scramble(words)\n```\n\n### How to Use\n\n1. Define a list of words to choose from.\n2. Call the `play_word_scramble` function with the list of words.\n3. The function will generate a scrambled word and prompt the user to unscramble it.\n4. The user enters their answer, and the function checks if it is correct.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `random.sample` function is used to shuffle the letters of the original word.\n* The `lower` method is used to make the game case-insensitive.\n* You can modify the `words` list to include your own set of words.",
