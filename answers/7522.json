  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary as input and calculates the total value of all items, assuming each key-value pair represents an item name and its corresponding price. The program should also find the item with the maximum price and the item with the minimum price.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef calculate_item_total(items):\n    # Calculate total value of all items\n    total = sum(items.values())\n\n    # Find item with maximum price\n    max_key = max(items, key=items.get)\n\n    # Find item with minimum price\n    min_key = min(items, key=items.get)\n\n    return total, max_key, min_key\n\n# Example usage\nitems = {\"item1\": 10, \"item2\": 20, \"item3\": 30, \"item4\": 40, \"item5\": 50}\ntotal, max_key, min_key = calculate_item_total(items)\n\nprint(f\"Total value of all items: {total}\")\nprint(f\"Item with maximum price: {max_key}\")\nprint(f\"Item with minimum price: {min_key}\")\n```\nThis code defines the `calculate_item_total` function, which takes a dictionary of items as input and returns the total value of all items, the item with the maximum price, and the item with the minimum price. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample dictionary of items and print the results.",
