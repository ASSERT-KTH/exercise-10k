  "prompt": "Write a program to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The `game()` function contains the main game loop, which runs until the user chooses to quit.\n2. The user is asked to enter their choice, and the input is validated to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n3. The computer's choice is randomly selected from the list of possible choices.\n4. The user's choice and the computer's choice are compared, and the result is printed out.\n5. The user is asked if they want to play again, and the game loop continues if they choose to.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nRun the program, and you'll be prompted to enter your choice. Type \"rock,\" \"paper,\" or \"scissors\" to make a selection. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the result will be printed out. You can play multiple rounds by choosing to play again after each round.",
