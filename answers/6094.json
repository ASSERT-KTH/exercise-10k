  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a binary search algorithm with a while loop to find an element in a sorted list:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find an element in a sorted list using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target (int): The element to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Binary Search Overview**: Binary search is a fast search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the array with each comparison until the target value is found.\n2.  **Variables Initialization**:\n    *   `low`: The starting index of the search range (initially 0).\n    *   `high`: The ending index of the search range (initially the last index of the list).\n    *   `mid`: The middle index of the current search range.\n3.  **While Loop**:\n    *   The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.\n    *   In each iteration, calculate the `mid` index and compare the middle element to the target.\n    *   If the middle element matches the target, return the `mid` index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n4.  **Result**:\n    *   If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n5.  **Example Usage**:\n    *   Create a sorted list and specify a target value.\n    *   Call the `binary_search` function with the sorted list and target value.\n    *   Print the result, indicating whether the target element was found and its index if found.",
