  "answer": "**Looping Statement with If/Else Statements**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that demonstrates the use of a looping statement (`for` loop) with `if`/`else` statements. This program will iterate over a list of numbers and check if each number is even or odd.\n\n```python\n# Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Loop through the list of numbers\nfor num in numbers:\n    # Check if the number is even\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is even\")\n    # If the number is not even, it must be odd\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is odd\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program defines a list of numbers (`numbers`) from 1 to 10.\n2. The `for` loop iterates over each number (`num`) in the list.\n3. For each number, the program checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0 (`num % 2 == 0`).\n4. If the number is even, the program prints a message indicating that the number is even.\n5. If the number is not even, the program prints a message indicating that the number is odd.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3 is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd\n6 is even\n7 is odd\n8 is even\n9 is odd\n10 is even\n```\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n* You can modify the condition in the `if` statement to check for other properties of the numbers, such as whether they are prime or divisible by a certain number.\n* You can use other types of looping statements, such as `while` loops, to achieve similar results.\n* You can use `elif` statements to check for multiple conditions and perform different actions based on each condition.",
