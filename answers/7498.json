  "answer": "### Set Operations\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that demonstrates basic set operations:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Initialize two sets\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n    print(\"Initial Sets:\")\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n\n    # Add an element to set1\n    print(\"\\nAdding 9 to Set 1:\")\n    set1.add(9)\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n\n    # Remove an element from set1\n    print(\"\\nRemoving 5 from Set 1:\")\n    set1.discard(5)\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n\n    # Union of set1 and set2\n    print(\"\\nUnion of Set 1 and Set 2:\")\n    union_set = set1.union(set2)\n    print(\"Union Set:\", union_set)\n\n    # Intersection of set1 and set2\n    print(\"\\nIntersection of Set 1 and Set 2:\")\n    intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)\n    print(\"Intersection Set:\", intersection_set)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing two sets, `set1` and `set2`, with some elements.\n2. **Add Operation**: We add an element `9` to `set1` using the `add()` method.\n3. **Remove Operation**: We remove an element `5` from `set1` using the `discard()` method.\n4. **Union Operation**: We compute the union of `set1` and `set2` using the `union()` method, which returns a new set containing all elements from both sets.\n5. **Intersection Operation**: We compute the intersection of `set1` and `set2` using the `intersection()` method, which returns a new set containing only the elements common to both sets.\n\n### Output\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nInitial Sets:\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nAdding 9 to Set 1:\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}\n\nRemoving 5 from Set 1:\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}\n\nUnion of Set 1 and Set 2:\nUnion Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nIntersection of Set 1 and Set 2:\nIntersection Set: {4}\n```",
