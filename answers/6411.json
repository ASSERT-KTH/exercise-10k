  "answer": "**Simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The program uses if/else statements to determine the outcome of each game.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    else:\n        return 'computer'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    \n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    \n    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    if winner == 'tie':\n        print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n    elif winner == 'user':\n        print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! You lose.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Plays multiple games of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    play_again = 'yes'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'yes':\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'yes' to play another game or 'no' to quit.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to determine the computer's choice. The `random` module is used to generate a random choice from the list of possible choices.",
