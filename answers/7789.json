  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user input and determines its data type. The program should be able to identify if the input is an integer, float, or string. It should also handle cases where the input cannot be converted to any of these types.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specification:\n```\n# Get user input\nuser_input = input(\"Enter a value: \")\n\n# Try to convert input to integer\ntry:\n    int(user_input)\n    print(\"The data type of the input is: integer\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    # Try to convert input to float\n    try:\n        float(user_input)\n        print(\"The data type of the input is: float\")\n    except ValueError:\n        # Input is not a number, must be a string\n        print(\"The data type of the input is: string\")\n```\nThis code follows the specification exactly, using `input()` to get the user's input, and then trying to convert the input to an integer, then a float, and finally assuming it's a string if both conversions fail. The `print()` statements inform the user of the data type of the input.",
