  "answer": "**Filtering List Elements in Python**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that filters out elements from a list of integers based on a specific condition.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef filter_list(condition, numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter out elements from a list of integers based on a condition.\n\n    Args:\n        condition (function): A function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers that meet the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    # Define a condition function to filter out even numbers\n    def is_even(num):\n        return num % 2 == 0\n\n    # Filter out even numbers\n    even_numbers = filter_list(is_even, numbers)\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n\n    # Define a condition function to filter out numbers greater than 5\n    def is_greater_than_5(num):\n        return num > 5\n\n    # Filter out numbers greater than 5\n    numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_list(is_greater_than_5, numbers)\n    print(\"Numbers greater than 5:\", numbers_greater_than_5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `filter_list` function takes a condition function and a list of integers as arguments.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to filter out elements from the list based on the condition.\n3. The condition function should take an integer and return a boolean value.\n4. In the example usage, we define two condition functions: `is_even` and `is_greater_than_5`.\n5. We then use the `filter_list` function to filter out even numbers and numbers greater than 5 from the list.\n\n### Output\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nNumbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```",
