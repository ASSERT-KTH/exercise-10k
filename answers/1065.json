  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a while loop to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The game continues until the user decides to quit.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the user's choice\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'q']:\n            return user_choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Returns the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = get_user_choice()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) or 'q' to quit.\n3. The computer's random choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n4. The game will continue until you decide to quit by entering 'q'.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple while loop to play the game. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice, and the `get_user_choice` function returns the user's choice. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.",
