  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that uses if/else statements to search for a book in a library.\n\n```python\n# Library Management System\n\n# List of books in the library\nbooks = [\n    {\"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"author\": \"Harper Lee\", \"available\": True},\n    {\"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"George Orwell\", \"available\": False},\n    {\"title\": \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"author\": \"Jane Austen\", \"available\": True},\n    {\"title\": \"The Great Gatsby\", \"author\": \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\", \"available\": True},\n    {\"title\": \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"author\": \"J.D. Salinger\", \"available\": False},\n]\n\ndef search_book_by_title(title):\n    \"\"\"Search for a book by title.\"\"\"\n    for book in books:\n        if book[\"title\"].lower() == title.lower():\n            return book\n    return None\n\ndef search_book_by_author(author):\n    \"\"\"Search for a book by author.\"\"\"\n    for book in books:\n        if book[\"author\"].lower() == author.lower():\n            return book\n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Library Management System!\")\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Search for a book by title\")\n        print(\"2. Search for a book by author\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n        \n        option = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n        \n        if option == \"1\":\n            title = input(\"Enter the title of the book: \")\n            book = search_book_by_title(title)\n            if book:\n                print(f\"\\nBook found: {book['title']} by {book['author']}\")\n                if book[\"available\"]:\n                    print(\"The book is available.\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"The book is not available.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"\\nBook not found.\")\n        elif option == \"2\":\n            author = input(\"Enter the author of the book: \")\n            book = search_book_by_author(author)\n            if book:\n                print(f\"\\nBook found: {book['title']} by {book['author']}\")\n                if book[\"available\"]:\n                    print(\"The book is available.\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"The book is not available.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"\\nBook not found.\")\n        elif option == \"3\":\n            print(\"\\nExiting the system. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nInvalid option. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1.  **Library Data**: The program stores a list of books in the `books` list, where each book is a dictionary containing the title, author, and availability.\n2.  **Search Functions**: There are two search functions: `search_book_by_title` and `search_book_by_author`. These functions iterate through the `books` list and return a book dictionary if a match is found based on the title or author.\n3.  **Main Function**: The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system. It prompts users to choose an option:\n\n    *   **Option 1**: Search for a book by title.\n    *   **Option 2**: Search for a book by author.\n    *   **Option 3**: Exit the system.\n4.  **Search and Display**: Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding search function and displays the result, including the book's title, author, and availability.\n5.  **Invalid Option**: If the user enters an invalid option, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to choose again.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Search for a book by title: Choose option 1 and enter the title of the book, such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".\n*   Search for a book by author: Choose option 2 and enter the author's name, such as \"Harper Lee\".\n*   Exit the system: Choose option 3 to exit the program.",
