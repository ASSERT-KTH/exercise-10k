  "answer": "**Calculating Total Bill with Sales Tax**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the total bill amount including sales tax.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_bill():\n    # Ask the user for the total bill\n    while True:\n        try:\n            total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill: $\"))\n            if total_bill < 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the sales tax percentage\n    while True:\n        try:\n            sales_tax_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the sales tax percentage (%): \"))\n            if sales_tax_percentage < 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the sales tax amount\n    sales_tax_amount = (sales_tax_percentage / 100) * total_bill\n\n    # Calculate the total amount to pay\n    total_amount_to_pay = total_bill + sales_tax_amount\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Total bill: ${total_bill:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Sales tax ({sales_tax_percentage}%): ${sales_tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount to pay: ${total_amount_to_pay:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_total_bill()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The program asks the user for the total bill and checks if the input is a non-negative number.\n2. It then asks the user for the sales tax percentage and checks if the input is a non-negative number.\n3. The program calculates the sales tax amount by multiplying the total bill with the sales tax percentage divided by 100.\n4. It calculates the total amount to pay by adding the total bill and the sales tax amount.\n5. Finally, it prints the total bill, sales tax amount, and the total amount to pay.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\nEnter the total bill: $100\nEnter the sales tax percentage (%): 8\nTotal bill: $100.00\nSales tax (8.00%): $8.00\nTotal amount to pay: $108.00\n```",
