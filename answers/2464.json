  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in each string and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(are_anagrams(\"listen\", \"silent\"))  # True\n    print(are_anagrams(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two strings as input and removes any whitespace from them.\n2. It converts both strings to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It checks if both strings have the same length. If they don't, it immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4. It sorts the characters in each string and compares the results. If the sorted strings are equal, the original strings are anagrams, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `sorted` function in Python uses the Timsort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.",
