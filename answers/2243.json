  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n\n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n2. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n3. Try to guess the number in as few tries as possible.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)`.\n2. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is valid (i.e., an integer between 1 and 10).\n4. If the user's guess is valid, the program checks if it is correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and ends the game. If not, the program gives the user a hint (e.g., \"Too low! Try again.\").\n5. The program keeps track of the number of tries the user has made and displays it when the user wins or quits.",
