  "prompt": "Create a program that prompts the user to input their name, age, and email address. The program should then print out a greeting message with the user's name, their age, and their email address.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Gets user's name, age, and email address.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    email = input(\"Please enter your email address: \")\n    return name, age, email\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age, email):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message with the user's name, age, and email address.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and your email address is {email}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age, email = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age, email)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to input their name, age, and email address using the built-in `input` function.\n* The `print_greeting` function takes in the user's name, age, and email address and prints out a greeting message.\n* The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_greeting` to print out the greeting message.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name, age, and email address. After you enter the information, it will print out a greeting message with the information you provided. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John Doe\nPlease enter your age: 30\nPlease enter your email address: johndoe@example.com\nHello, John Doe! You are 30 years old and your email address is johndoe@example.com.\n```",
