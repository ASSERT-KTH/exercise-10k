  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\nThis program uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for input until they enter a valid password. The password is considered valid if it meets the following criteria:\n\n* It is at least 8 characters long\n* It contains at least one uppercase letter\n* It contains at least one lowercase letter\n* It contains at least one digit\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(r\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(r\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(r\"\\d\", password):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for a password\n        password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n\n        # Validate the password\n        if validate_password(password):\n            print(\"Password is valid.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Password is not valid. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a password that does not meet the validation criteria (e.g. \"hello\").\n3. The program will print \"Password is not valid. Please try again.\" and ask for a password again.\n4. Enter a password that meets the validation criteria (e.g. \"HelloWorld123\").\n5. The program will print \"Password is valid.\" and exit the loop.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple regular expression to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits in the password. It does not check for other types of characters, such as special characters or whitespace. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to modify the validation criteria and the regular expressions used to check for them.",
