  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a while loop to print a string in reverse:\n\n```python\ndef print_reverse_string(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the input string in reverse using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to be printed in reverse.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n\n    # Use a while loop to iterate over the string from the end to the beginning\n    while index >= 0:\n        # Print the character at the current index\n        print(input_string[index], end='')\n\n        # Decrement the index to move to the previous character\n        index -= 1\n\n# Test the function\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nprint_reverse_string(input_string)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function `print_reverse_string` takes an input string and initializes a variable `index` to the last index of the string.\n2. The while loop checks if the `index` is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, the loop body is executed.\n3. Inside the loop, the character at the current `index` is printed using `print(input_string[index], end='')`. The `end=''` argument is used to prevent a newline character from being printed after each character.\n4. The `index` is then decremented by 1 to move to the previous character in the string.\n5. Steps 2-4 are repeated until the `index` is less than 0, at which point the loop ends and the function returns.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\n* Input: \"Hello World\"\n* Output: \"dlroW olleH\"",
