  "answer": "### Function to Find First Non-Repeated Character\n\nHere's a Python function that uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the string, then returns the first character that has a count of 1.\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeated_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeated character. If no such character exists, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    \n    # Find the first non-repeated character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    # If no non-repeated character exists, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nprint(first_non_repeated_char(\"hello\"))  # Output: h\nprint(first_non_repeated_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create a dictionary `char_count` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string and count the frequency of each character.\n3. Iterate over the string again and return the first character that has a count of 1 in the `char_count` dictionary.\n4. If no non-repeated character exists, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we're iterating over the string twice.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because in the worst case, we might need to store every character in the `char_count` dictionary.",
