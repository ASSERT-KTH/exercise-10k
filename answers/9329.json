  "answer": "**Variable Reassignment Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example Python program that demonstrates variable reassignment:\n\n```python\n# Define a variable and assign it a value\nx = 10\nprint(\"Initial value of x:\", x)\n\n# Reassign the variable to a new value\nx = 20\nprint(\"Value of x after reassignment:\", x)\n\n# Reassign the variable to a different data type\nx = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(\"Value of x after reassignment to string:\", x)\n\n# Reassign the variable to a list\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Value of x after reassignment to list:\", x)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nInitial value of x: 10\nValue of x after reassignment: 20\nValue of x after reassignment to string: Hello, World!\nValue of x after reassignment to list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We start by defining a variable `x` and assigning it an initial value of `10`.\n*   We then reassign `x` to a new value of `20`, demonstrating that the variable's value can be changed.\n*   Next, we reassign `x` to a string value `\"Hello, World!\"`, showing that the variable can hold different data types.\n*   Finally, we reassign `x` to a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, further illustrating the variable's ability to hold various data types.\n\nThis program showcases the concept of variable reassignment, where a variable's value can be changed after its initial assignment.",
