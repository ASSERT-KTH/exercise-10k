  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out the corresponding letter grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The program should also handle cases where the input is not a valid grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to determine the letter grade\ndef determine_grade(grade):\n    if not isinstance(grade, (int, float)) or grade < 0 or grade > 100:\n        return \"Invalid grade\"\n    elif grade >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif grade >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif grade >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif grade >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Define a main function to test the determine_grade function\ndef main():\n    print(determine_grade(55))  # Should print \"F\"\n    print(determine_grade(90))  # Should print \"A\"\n    print(determine_grade(80))  # Should print \"B\"\n    print(determine_grade(70))  # Should print \"C\"\n    print(determine_grade(60))  # Should print \"D\"\n    print(determine_grade(-1))  # Should print \"Invalid grade\"\n    print(determine_grade(\"A\"))  # Should print \"Invalid grade\"\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `determine_grade` function, which takes a grade as input and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the specified conditions. It also defines a `main` function, which tests the `determine_grade` function with various inputs. Finally, it calls the `main` function to execute the test cases.",
