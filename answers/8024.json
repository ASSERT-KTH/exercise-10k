  "prompt": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA' is 'BCBA'. Write a function to solve this problem using dynamic programming.",
  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Problem Solution**\n\nThe following solution uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    seq1 (str): The first sequence.\n    seq2 (str): The second sequence.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.\n    str: The longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m, n = len(seq1), len(seq2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the first row and column to 0\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = 0\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = 0\n    \n    # Fill the dp table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(seq1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    # Return the length and the longest common subsequence\n    return dp[m][n], \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    seq1 = \"ABCBDAB\"\n    seq2 = \"BDCABA\"\n    length, lcs = longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2)\n    print(\"Length of the longest common subsequence:\", length)\n    print(\"Longest common subsequence:\", lcs)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We create a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input sequences `seq1` and `seq2`, respectively. The extra row and column are for handling edge cases.\n2. **Base Cases**: We initialize the first row and column of the `dp` table to 0, since there is no common subsequence between an empty sequence and a non-empty sequence.\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: We fill the `dp` table in a bottom-up manner using the following recurrence relation:\n   * If the current characters in `seq1` and `seq2` match, we increment the length of the common subsequence by 1.\n   * Otherwise, we take the maximum length of the common subsequence from the previous cells.\n4. **Reconstruction**: We reconstruct the longest common subsequence by tracing back the `dp` table from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n5. **Result**: We return the length and the longest common subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m x n), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(m x n), since we need to store the `dp` table.",
