  "answer": "**Sales Tax Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of an item based on its price and sales tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total cost of an item based on its price and sales tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n    - price (float): The price of the item.\n    - tax_rate (float): The sales tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The total cost of the item.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    total_cost = price + tax_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price of the item: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the sales tax rate (in %): \"))\n\n    # Convert tax rate from percentage to decimal\n    tax_rate = tax_rate / 100\n\n    # Calculate total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the price of the item when prompted (e.g., `100`).\n3. Enter the sales tax rate when prompted (e.g., `8` for 8%).\n4. The program will calculate and display the total cost (e.g., `Total cost: $108.00`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* The tax rate is assumed to be a percentage value (e.g., 8 for 8%).\n* The program converts the tax rate from percentage to decimal before calculation.\n* The total cost is calculated by adding the tax amount to the item price.\n* The result is displayed with two decimal places.",
