  "prompt": "Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using variables.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\n\n# Perform addition\naddition_result = num1 + num2\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n# Perform subtraction\nsubtraction_result = num1 - num2\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n# Perform multiplication\nmultiplication_result = num1 * num2\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n# Perform division\nif num2 != 0:\n    division_result = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by defining two variables `num1` and `num2` and assigning them values.\n*   We then perform the basic arithmetic operations using these variables and store the results in separate variables.\n*   The results are printed to the console using f-strings for formatting.\n*   For division, we add a check to ensure that we are not dividing by zero, which would result in an error.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   You can replace the values of `num1` and `num2` with any numbers to perform arithmetic operations on them.\n*   You can also modify the program to accept user input for `num1` and `num2` to make it more interactive.\n*   This program can be used as a starting point for more complex arithmetic operations or for building a simple calculator.",
