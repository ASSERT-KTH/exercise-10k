  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a credit score as input and prints the corresponding credit rating based on the following criteria: Excellent (750-850), Good (700-749), Fair (650-699), Poor (below 650).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Description: This program takes a credit score as input and prints the corresponding credit rating.\n\ndef credit_rating(score):\n    if 750 <= score <= 850:\n        return \"Excellent\"\n    elif 700 <= score <= 749:\n        return \"Good\"\n    elif 650 <= score <= 699:\n        return \"Fair\"\n    else:\n        return \"Poor\"\n\ncredit_score = int(input(\"Enter your credit score: \"))\nrating = credit_rating(credit_score)\nprint(\"Your credit rating is: \", rating)\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as you should fill those in with your own information. Also, I've assumed that the credit score input will be an integer, so I've used the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer. If you want to allow for non-integer inputs, you can modify the code accordingly.",
