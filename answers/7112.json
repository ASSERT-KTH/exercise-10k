  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the provided specifications:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str;\n    std::cout << \"Enter a string: \";\n    std::cin >> str;\n    int len = str.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        std::cout << str[len - i - 1];\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter a string, store the input in the `str` variable, and then print the characters of the string in reverse order. The loop iterates `len` times, where `len` is the length of the string, and prints each character at index `len - i - 1`, effectively reversing the string.",
