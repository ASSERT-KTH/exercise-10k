  "answer": "**Coin Converter Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes an amount in cents as input and converts it to the fewest number of coins possible using the available denominations: 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef coin_converter(amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an amount to the fewest number of coins possible.\n\n    Args:\n    amount (int): The amount in cents to convert.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary with the coin denominations as keys and the number of coins as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the available denominations\n    denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]\n\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the number of coins for each denomination\n    coins = {denomination: 0 for denomination in denominations}\n\n    # Iterate over the denominations in descending order\n    for denomination in denominations:\n        # Calculate the number of coins for the current denomination\n        coins[denomination] = amount // denomination\n        # Update the remaining amount\n        amount %= denomination\n\n    return coins\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the amount from the user\n    amount = int(input(\"Enter an amount in cents: \"))\n\n    # Convert the amount to coins\n    coins = coin_converter(amount)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Coin Conversion:\")\n    for denomination, count in coins.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            print(f\"{denomination} cents: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter an amount in cents when prompted (e.g., 36).\n3. The program will output the coin conversion:\n```\nCoin Conversion:\n25 cents: 1\n10 cents: 1\n1 cents: 1\n```\nThis indicates that the amount of 36 cents can be converted to 1 quarter (25 cents), 1 dime (10 cents), and 1 penny (1 cent).",
