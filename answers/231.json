  "answer": "### Remove Duplicate Characters from a String\n#### Function Description\nThe following function takes a string as input, removes duplicate characters, and returns the resulting string. This function is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef remove_duplicate_chars(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate characters from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The input string with duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_str:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Original String:\", input_str)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicate_chars(input_str))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of characters we've encountered so far.\n2. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. If a character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and append it to the `result` list.\n4. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario (when all characters are unique), the size of the `seen` set and the `result` list will be equal to the length of the input string.",
