  "answer": "**Splitting a Dictionary into Two Dictionaries Based on a Condition**\n\nYou can split a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a certain condition using dictionary comprehension in Python. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n\n```python\ndef split_dict(input_dict, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits a dictionary into two dictionaries based on a certain condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary to be split.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair as input and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains key-value pairs for which the condition is True, and the second dictionary contains key-value pairs for which the condition is False.\n    \"\"\"\n    dict_true = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if condition(key, value)}\n    dict_false = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if not condition(key, value)}\n    return dict_true, dict_false\n\n# Example usage\ninput_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\n# Define a condition function that checks if the value is even\ndef is_even(key, value):\n    return value % 2 == 0\n\ndict_even, dict_odd = split_dict(input_dict, is_even)\n\nprint(\"Dictionary with even values:\")\nprint(dict_even)\nprint(\"Dictionary with odd values:\")\nprint(dict_odd)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `split_dict` function takes an input dictionary and a condition function as arguments. It uses dictionary comprehension to create two dictionaries: `dict_true` and `dict_false`. The `dict_true` dictionary contains key-value pairs for which the condition is True, and the `dict_false` dictionary contains key-value pairs for which the condition is False.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to split a dictionary into two dictionaries based on whether the values are even or odd. The `is_even` function is used as the condition function, and the resulting dictionaries are printed to the console.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDictionary with even values:\n{'b': 2, 'd': 4}\nDictionary with odd values:\n{'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n```",
