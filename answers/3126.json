  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime or not.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n\n    # Validate input\n    try:\n        num = int(num)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n        return\n\n    # Check if the number is prime\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`.\n2. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number, so the function returns `False`.\n3. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number, so the function returns `True`.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number.\n5. The input is validated to ensure it is a whole number.\n6. The `is_prime` function is called with the user's input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23 or 37, to see the program output that it is a prime number.\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 24 or 48, to see the program output that it is not a prime number.\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0 or 1, to see the program output that it is not a prime number.\n* Enter a non-numeric input, such as \"hello\" or \"abc\", to see the program output an error message.",
