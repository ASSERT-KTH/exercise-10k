  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    base (float): The base of the triangle.\n    height (float): The height of the triangle.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n    \n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is {area}.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the formula for the area of a triangle: `A = 0.5 * b * h`, where `A` is the area, `b` is the base, and `h` is the height. The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the calculated area. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with user input. It also includes error checking to ensure that the base and height are not negative.",
