  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it. Print 'Correct!' if the user guesses correctly, otherwise print 'Try again!'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Ask the user to guess the number\n    while True:\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")\n        \n        # Validate the user's input\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Try again!\")\n\n# Call the function to start the game\nguess_number()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. If your guess is correct, the program will print \"Correct!\" and stop.\n5. If your guess is incorrect, the program will print \"Try again!\" and ask for another guess.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The `random.randint(a, b)` function returns a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`.\n* The `input()` function returns a string, so we need to convert the user's input to an integer using `int()`.\n* We use a `try-except` block to handle the case where the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer.\n* The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.",
