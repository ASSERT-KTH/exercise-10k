  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array and two indices as input and swaps the elements at these indices. The function should handle cases where the indices are out of range or identical.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll provide a comprehensive solution to create a function that swaps elements at two given indices in an array, handling edge cases such as out-of-range or identical indices. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef swap_elements(array, index1, index2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function swaps the elements at two given indices in an array.\n    \n    It handles cases where the indices are out of range or identical.\n    \n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        index1 (int): The first index.\n        index2 (int): The second index.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The array with elements swapped at the given indices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the array is None to avoid any potential errors\n    if array is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array cannot be None\")\n\n    # Then, we check if the indices are integers\n    if not isinstance(index1, int) or not isinstance(index2, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Indices must be integers\")\n\n    # We check if the indices are within the range of the array\n    if index1 < 0 or index1 >= len(array) or index2 < 0 or index2 >= len(array):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n    # If the indices are identical, there's no need to swap anything\n    if index1 == index2:\n        # So, we simply return the original array\n        return array\n\n    # Now, we can safely swap the elements at the given indices\n    # We use tuple packing and unpacking to achieve this in a single line\n    # This works by first packing the elements at the given indices into a tuple\n    # Then, we immediately unpack the tuple back into the array, but with the elements in reverse order\n    array[index1], array[index2] = array[index2], array[index1]\n\n    # Finally, we return the modified array\n    return array\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `swap_elements` first checks if the input `array` is `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it is. It also checks if the indices `index1` and `index2` are integers and raises a `ValueError` if they are not.\n* The function then checks if the indices are within the range of the `array`. If they are not, it raises an `IndexError`.\n* If the indices are identical, the function simply returns the original `array` as there's no need to swap anything.\n* Finally, the function uses tuple packing and unpacking to swap the elements at the given indices in a single line, and returns the modified `array`.",
