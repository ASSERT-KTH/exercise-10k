  "answer": "Here's a Python program that defines a Rational class and a function to multiply two rational numbers:\n\n```python\nclass Rational:\n    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):\n        if denominator == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n        \n        self.numerator = numerator\n        self.denominator = denominator\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.numerator}/{self.denominator}\"\n\n    def multiply(self, other):\n        numerator = self.numerator * other.numerator\n        denominator = self.denominator * other.denominator\n        return Rational(numerator, denominator)\n\n    def simplify(self):\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        common_divisor = gcd(self.numerator, self.denominator)\n        return Rational(self.numerator // common_divisor, self.denominator // common_divisor)\n\n\ndef multiply_rationals(r1, r2):\n    product = r1.multiply(r2)\n    return product.simplify()\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    r1 = Rational(1, 2)\n    r2 = Rational(1, 3)\n    \n    result = multiply_rationals(r1, r2)\n    print(f\"Product of {r1} and {r2} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Rational Class**: A class named `Rational` is defined to represent rational numbers. Each rational number has a `numerator` and a `denominator`.\n2.  **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes a rational number with a given numerator and denominator. It checks if the denominator is zero and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n3.  **String Representation**: The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the rational number in the format \"numerator/denominator\".\n4.  **Multiplication**: The `multiply` method takes another rational number as input and returns their product as a new rational number.\n5.  **Simplification**: The `simplify` method simplifies a rational number by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n6.  **GCD Calculation**: A helper function `gcd` calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n7.  **Main Function**: The `multiply_rationals` function takes two rational numbers as input, multiplies them, and returns the simplified product.\n8.  **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, an example usage of the program is demonstrated. Two rational numbers are created, multiplied, and the result is printed.",
