  "answer": "**Tuple Operations Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program demonstrates basic tuple operations such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Create a tuple\n    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n    print(\"Original Tuple:\", my_tuple)\n\n    # Indexing\n    print(\"\\nIndexing:\")\n    print(\"Element at index 0:\", my_tuple[0])\n    print(\"Element at index -1 (last element):\", my_tuple[-1])\n\n    # Slicing\n    print(\"\\nSlicing:\")\n    print(\"Elements from index 1 to 3:\", my_tuple[1:4])\n    print(\"Elements from start to index 3:\", my_tuple[:4])\n    print(\"Elements from index 2 to end:\", my_tuple[2:])\n    print(\"All elements:\", my_tuple[:])\n\n    # Concatenation\n    print(\"\\nConcatenation:\")\n    another_tuple = (6, 7, 8)\n    print(\"Concatenated Tuple:\", my_tuple + another_tuple)\n\n    # Repetition\n    print(\"\\nRepetition:\")\n    repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 2\n    print(\"Repeated Tuple:\", repeated_tuple)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Indexing**: This operation allows you to access a specific element in the tuple using its index.\n    *   Positive indices start from 0 and refer to the elements from left to right.\n    *   Negative indices start from -1 and refer to the elements from right to left.\n2.  **Slicing**: This operation enables you to extract a subset of elements from the tuple.\n    *   The general syntax for slicing is `my_tuple[start:stop:step]`.\n    *   You can omit any of the `start`, `stop`, or `step` parameters to use their default values.\n3.  **Concatenation**: This operation combines two or more tuples into a single tuple.\n    *   You can use the `+` operator to concatenate tuples.\n4.  **Repetition**: This operation creates a new tuple by repeating the original tuple a specified number of times.\n    *   You can use the `*` operator to repeat a tuple.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nIndexing:\nElement at index 0: 1\nElement at index -1 (last element): 5\n\nSlicing:\nElements from index 1 to 3: (2, 3, 4)\nElements from start to index 3: (1, 2, 3, 4)\nElements from index 2 to end: (3, 4, 5)\nAll elements: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nConcatenation:\nConcatenated Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n\nRepetition:\nRepeated Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```",
