  "answer": "**Filtering a List of Numbers with the `filter` Function**\n==========================================================\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses the `filter` function to filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_numbers(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The filtered list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(filter(condition, numbers))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef is_even(num):\n    \"\"\"Return True if the number is even, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, is_even)\n\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `filter_numbers` function takes a list of numbers and a condition function as arguments.\n*   The `filter` function is used to filter the list of numbers based on the condition.\n*   The result is converted to a list using the `list` function.\n*   The `is_even` function is an example of a condition function that checks if a number is even.\n\n### Using a Lambda Function as the Condition\n\nYou can also use a lambda function as the condition:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\n\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis approach can be more concise, but may be less readable for complex conditions.",
