  "prompt": "Write a program that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using variables.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int a = 5;\n    int b = 2;\n    int add;\n    int sub;\n    int mult;\n    int div;\n\n    add = a + b;\n    std::cout << \"Addition: \" << add << std::endl;\n\n    sub = a - b;\n    std::cout << \"Subtraction: \" << sub << std::endl;\n\n    mult = a * b;\n    std::cout << \"Multiplication: \" << mult << std::endl;\n\n    div = a / b;\n    std::cout << \"Division: \" << div << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, including the variable names, data types, and the order of operations. The code should produce the expected output as described in the specifications. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
