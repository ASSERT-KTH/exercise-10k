  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The program should allow the user to add a student, add a grade for a student, and calculate the average grade for a student. The dictionary should use the student's name as the key and a list of grades as the value.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# student_grades.py\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades\nstudent_grades = {}\n\ndef add_student(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add a new student to the dictionary.\n    \n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if name not in student_grades:\n        student_grades[name] = []\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' already exists.\")\n\ndef add_grade(name, grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add a grade for a student.\n    \n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the student.\n        grade (float): The grade to be added.\n    \"\"\"\n    if name in student_grades:\n        student_grades[name].append(grade)\n        print(f\"Grade '{grade}' added for student '{name}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist.

Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Add a student: Enter the student's name.\n\t* Add a grade for a student: Enter the student's name and the grade.\n\t* Calculate the average grade for a student: Enter the student's name.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. The program will perform the chosen action and display the result.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses a dictionary to store student grades, where each key is a student's name and the value is a list of grades.\n* The `add_student` function adds a new student to the dictionary.\n* The `add_grade` function adds a grade for a student.\n* The `calculate_average` function calculates the average grade for a student.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.",
