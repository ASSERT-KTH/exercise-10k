  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle cases where the user chooses division and the second number is zero.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in C++ based on the provided specification:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, n;\n    char ch;\n\n    cout << \"Enter first number: \";\n    cin >> a;\n\n    cout << \"Enter second number: \";\n    cin >> b;\n\n    cout << \"Enter your choice (+, -, *, /): \";\n    cin >> ch;\n\n    switch (ch) {\n        case '+':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << a + b << endl;\n            break;\n        case '-':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << a - b << endl;\n            break;\n        case '*':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << a * b << endl;\n            break;\n        case '/':\n            if (b == 0) {\n                cout << \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" << endl;\n            } else {\n                cout << \"Result: \" << (float)a / b << endl;\n            }\n            break;\n        default:\n            cout << \"Invalid choice. Please choose +, -, *, or /.\" << endl;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code does exactly what the specification describes. It takes two numbers and a choice of operation from the user, performs the chosen operation, and then prints the result. It also handles the case where the user chooses division and the second number is zero.",
