  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input from the user and prints the number of characters in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef count_characters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for user input and prints the number of characters in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    character_count = len(user_input)\n    print(f\"The string has {character_count} characters.\")\n\ndef main():\n    count_characters()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `count_characters` function uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for a string.\n2. The `len` function is used to count the number of characters in the input string.\n3. The character count is then printed to the console.\n4. The `main` function calls `count_characters` to start the program.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that `main` is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a string. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter a string: Hello, World!\nThe string has 13 characters.\n```",
