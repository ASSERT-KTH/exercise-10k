  "answer": "**Linear Equation Solver Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program solves a linear equation of the form ax + b = c. It takes the coefficients a, b, and c as input and outputs the solution for x.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef solve_linear_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a linear equation of the form ax + b = c.\n    \n    Args:\n    a (float): Coefficient of x.\n    b (float): Constant term on the left side.\n    c (float): Constant term on the right side.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: Solution for x.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        if b == c:\n            return \"Infinite solutions\"\n        else:\n            return \"No solution\"\n    else:\n        return (c - b) / a\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    a = float(input(\"Enter coefficient a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter coefficient b: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter coefficient c: \"))\n\n    # Solve the equation\n    solution = solve_linear_equation(a, b, c)\n\n    # Print the solution\n    print(\"The solution is:\", solution)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program uses a simple function `solve_linear_equation` to solve the linear equation. It first checks if the coefficient a is zero. If a is zero, the equation becomes b = c, which has either infinite solutions (if b equals c) or no solution (if b does not equal c).\n\nIf a is not zero, the function subtracts b from both sides of the equation and then divides both sides by a, resulting in the solution x = (c - b) / a.\n\nThe `main` function gets the coefficients a, b, and c from the user, solves the equation using the `solve_linear_equation` function, and prints the solution.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n1. Solve the equation 2x + 3 = 7:\n   - Enter coefficient a: 2\n   - Enter coefficient b: 3\n   - Enter coefficient c: 7\n   - The solution is: 2.0\n\n2. Solve the equation x - 2 = 3:\n   - Enter coefficient a: 1\n   - Enter coefficient b: -2\n   - Enter coefficient c: 3\n   - The solution is: 5.0\n\n3. Solve the equation 0x + 2 = 2:\n   - Enter coefficient a: 0\n   - Enter coefficient b: 2\n   - Enter coefficient c: 2\n   - The solution is: Infinite solutions\n\n4. Solve the equation 0x + 2 = 3:\n   - Enter coefficient a: 0\n   - Enter coefficient b: 2\n   - Enter coefficient c: 3\n   - The solution is: No solution",
