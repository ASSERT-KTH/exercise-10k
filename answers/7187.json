  "answer": "**Selection Sort Algorithm Implementation**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe selection sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Loop through the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the minimum index\n        min_idx = i\n        \n        # Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        \n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first unsorted element\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define an example array\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    \n    # Print the original array\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    \n    # Sort the array using selection sort\n    sorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\n    \n    # Print the sorted array\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `selection_sort` function takes an input array `arr` and iterates through it using a nested loop structure.\n2.  The outer loop (`for i in range(len(arr))`) iterates through each element in the array.\n3.  The inner loop (`for j in range(i + 1, len(arr))`) finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array by comparing each element with the current minimum.\n4.  Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the first unsorted element (`arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]`).\n5.  The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case time complexity: O(n^2)\n*   Average-case time complexity: O(n^2)\n*   Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space for variables.",
