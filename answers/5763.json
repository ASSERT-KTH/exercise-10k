  "prompt": "Develop a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Program Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Return the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if player1 == player2:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (player1 == 'rock' and player2 == 'scissors') or \\\n       (player1 == 'scissors' and player2 == 'paper') or \\\n       (player1 == 'paper' and player2 == 'rock'):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        player1 = input(\"Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while player1 not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            player1 = input(\"Invalid choice.

Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != 'yes':\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_computer_choice` function is not used in this version of the program, but it can be used if you want to play against the computer.\n* The `determine_winner` function takes the choices of both players and returns the winner based on the game's rules.\n* The `main` function runs the game in a loop until the players choose to stop playing.\n* The program asks each player for their choice, checks if the input is valid, and then determines the winner.\n* The program then asks if the players want to play again and repeats the process if they answer yes.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Two players can play against each other by running the program and following the prompts.\n* To play against the computer, you can modify the program to use the `get_computer_choice` function to generate the computer's choice.",
