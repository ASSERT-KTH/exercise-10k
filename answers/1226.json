  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a for loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) based on a given number of rows:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(rows):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on a given number of rows.\n    \n    Args:\n        rows (int): The number of rows in the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(rows):\n        # Print asterisks on each row, with the number of asterisks equal to the current row number plus one\n        print('* ' * (i + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of rows from the user\n    rows = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    \n    # Print the pattern\n    print_pattern(rows)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the number of rows. For example, if you enter `5`, it will print the following pattern:\n```\n* \n* * \n* * * \n* * * * \n* * * * * \n```\n\n**How It Works**\n\n1. The `print_pattern` function takes an integer `rows` as input, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each row.\n3. On each row, it prints asterisks using the expression `'* ' * (i + 1)`, where `i` is the current row number. The `+ 1` is used because the row numbers start at 0, but we want to print at least one asterisk on each row.\n4. The `main` function gets the number of rows from the user, calls the `print_pattern` function, and prints the result.",
