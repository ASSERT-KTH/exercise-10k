  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_random_number(min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"Generate a random number between min_value and max_value (inclusive)\"\"\"\n    return random.randint(min_value, max_value)\n\ndef get_user_guess(min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate it\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Guess a number between {min_value} and {max_value}: \"))\n            if min_value <= guess <= max_value:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(f\"Please enter a number between {min_value} and {max_value}.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef provide_hint(guess, target):\n    \"\"\"Provide a hint based on the user's guess\"\"\"\n    if guess < target:\n        return \"Too low\"\n    elif guess > target:\n        return \"Too high\"\n    else:\n        return \"Congratulations, you've guessed the number!\"\n\ndef main():\n    min_value = 1\n    max_value = 100\n    target_number = generate_random_number(min_value, max_value)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the Random Number Guessing Game!\")\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {min_value} and {max_value}.\")\n\n    while True:\n        guess = get_user_guess(min_value, max_value)\n        attempts += 1\n        hint = provide_hint(guess, target_number)\n        print(hint)\n\n        if hint.startswith(\"Congratulations\"):\n            print(f\"It took you {attempts} attempts to guess the number.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `guessing_game.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using Python: `python guessing_game.py`\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt you to guess the number. After each guess, it will provide a hint, such as \"Too high\" or \"Too low\". The game will continue until you guess the correct number, at which point it will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.",
