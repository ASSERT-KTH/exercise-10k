  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n\nHere's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is less than 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Base case**: We define the base case where `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the factorial is 1.\n2. **Recursive case**: For `n` greater than 1, we call the `factorial` function with `n-1` and multiply the result by `n`.\n3. **Error handling**: We raise a `ValueError` if `n` is less than 0, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n4. **Example usage**: In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of 5.",
