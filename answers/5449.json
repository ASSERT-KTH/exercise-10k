  "answer": "**Capitalizing the First Letter of Each Word in a Sentence**\n\nBelow is a Python program that accomplishes this task. It uses the built-in `title()` method of Python strings, which capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes all other characters in the word lowercase.\n\n```python\ndef capitalize_first_letters(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sentence.title()\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the sentence from the user\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")\n\n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word\n    capitalized_sentence = capitalize_first_letters(sentence)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Capitalized sentence:\", capitalized_sentence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `capitalize_first_letters` function takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized using the `title()` method.\n2. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a sentence.\n3. The entered sentence is then passed to the `capitalize_first_letters` function to capitalize the first letter of each word.\n4. Finally, the program prints out the sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence. For example, if you enter \"hello world\", the program will output \"Hello World\".",
