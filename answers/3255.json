  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the GCD and LCM of two numbers:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd_lcm(num1, num2):\n    # Calculate GCD using math.gcd function\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate LCM using the formula: lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return gcd, lcm\n\n# Get input from user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate GCD and LCM\ngcd, lcm = calculate_gcd_lcm(num1, num2)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\nprint(f\"LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the math module**: The `math` module in Python provides a function `gcd()` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n2. **Define a function**: The `calculate_gcd_lcm()` function takes two numbers as input and returns their GCD and LCM.\n3. **Calculate GCD**: Use the `math.gcd()` function to calculate the GCD of the two numbers.\n4. **Calculate LCM**: Use the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)` to calculate the LCM of the two numbers.\n5. **Get user input**: Ask the user to input two numbers.\n6. **Call the function**: Call the `calculate_gcd_lcm()` function with the user input and store the results.\n7. **Print the results**: Print the GCD and LCM of the two numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the GCD and LCM of 12 and 15:\n    *   GCD: 3\n    *   LCM: 60\n*   Calculate the GCD and LCM of 24 and 30:\n    *   GCD: 6\n    *   LCM: 120\n\nThis program uses the `math.gcd()` function to calculate the GCD, which is more efficient than implementing the Euclidean algorithm manually. The LCM is calculated using the formula, which is a simple and efficient way to calculate it.",
