  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a series of numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes a series of numbers as input and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef sum_numbers(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_numbers(numbers)\nprint(f\"The sum of the numbers is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `sum_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers. We then provide an example usage of the function, where we pass a list of numbers to the function and print the result.\n\nIf you want to take the numbers as input from the user, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_numbers():\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a series of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n    return sum(numbers)\n\nresult = sum_numbers()\nprint(f\"The sum of the numbers is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this version, the `sum_numbers` function prompts the user to enter a series of numbers separated by spaces, splits the input string into a list of numbers, converts each number to an integer, and then returns the sum of the numbers.",
