  "answer": "### Creating a Copy of a Dictionary using the `copy()` Method\n\nThe `copy()` method in Python creates a shallow copy of a dictionary. This means that it creates a new dictionary and inserts references to the original elements.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef create_dict_copy(original_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a shallow copy of a dictionary using the copy() method.\n\n    Args:\n        original_dict (dict): The dictionary to be copied.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A shallow copy of the original dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the original dictionary\n    dict_copy = original_dict.copy()\n\n    return dict_copy\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nprint(\"Original Dictionary:\")\nprint(original_dict)\n\ndict_copy = create_dict_copy(original_dict)\nprint(\"\\nCopied Dictionary:\")\nprint(dict_copy)\n\n# Modify the original dictionary to demonstrate that the copy is shallow\noriginal_dict[\"name\"] = \"Jane\"\nprint(\"\\nOriginal Dictionary after modification:\")\nprint(original_dict)\nprint(\"\\nCopied Dictionary after modification:\")\nprint(dict_copy)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `create_dict_copy()` function takes an original dictionary as input and returns a shallow copy of it.\n*   Inside the function, the `copy()` method is used to create a copy of the original dictionary.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `create_dict_copy()` function to create a copy of a dictionary.\n*   It also shows that the copy is shallow by modifying the original dictionary and verifying that the copied dictionary remains unchanged.\n\nNote that if the original dictionary contains mutable objects (like lists or other dictionaries) and you modify those objects, the changes will be reflected in the copied dictionary as well, because the `copy()` method only creates a new reference to the original objects. If you need a deep copy (where all nested objects are also copied), you can use the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.",
