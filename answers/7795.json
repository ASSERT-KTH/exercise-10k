  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks the user to guess a random number between 1 and 10.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 10 and ask you to guess it.\n3. Type your guess and press Enter.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.",
