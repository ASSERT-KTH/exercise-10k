  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number. If the number is even, it should print 'Even' next to the number. If the number is odd, it should print 'Odd' next to the number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(f'{i} Even')\n    else:\n        print(f'{i} Odd')\n```\nThis code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers 1 to 10, and for each number, it checks whether it's even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, it prints the number followed by \"Even\", otherwise it prints the number followed by \"Odd\".",
