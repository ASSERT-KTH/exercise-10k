  "answer": "**Partitioning a List of Integers**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python program that partitions a list of integers into two sublists based on a specific condition. In this example, we will partition the list into two sublists: one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef partition_list(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition a list of integers into two sublists based on a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n    - numbers (list): The list of integers to be partitioned.\n    - condition (function): A function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n    - tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the numbers that satisfy the condition, and the second list contains the numbers that do not satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    satisfied = [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]\n    not_satisfied = [num for num in numbers if not condition(num)]\n    return satisfied, not_satisfied\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef is_even(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is even.\"\"\"\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\neven_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, is_even)\n\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `partition_list` function takes a list of integers and a condition function as input.\n2.  It uses list comprehensions to create two lists: `satisfied` and `not_satisfied`. The `satisfied` list contains the numbers that satisfy the condition, and the `not_satisfied` list contains the numbers that do not satisfy the condition.\n3.  The function returns a tuple containing the `satisfied` and `not_satisfied` lists.\n4.  In the example usage, we define a list of integers and a condition function `is_even` that checks if a number is even.\n5.  We call the `partition_list` function with the list of integers and the `is_even` condition function, and it returns two lists: `even_numbers` and `odd_numbers`.\n6.  Finally, we print the `even_numbers` and `odd_numbers` lists.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```",
