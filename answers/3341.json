  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to count from 1 to 10 and print each number:\n\n```python\n# Define a range of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)\nnumbers = range(1, 11)\n\n# Use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers\nfor number in numbers:\n    # Print each number\n    print(number)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following more concise version:\n\n```python\n# Use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 10\nfor number in range(1, 11):\n    # Print each number\n    print(number)\n```\n\nBoth of these programs will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nNote that the `range` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers up to but not including the stop value, which is why we use `11` instead of `10` to include `10` in the range.",
