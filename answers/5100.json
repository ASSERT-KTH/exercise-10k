  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\nHere is a simple Python program that plays a number guessing game with the user:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will tell them if their guess is too high or too low.\n4. The user can keep guessing until they find the correct number.\n5. If the user wants to quit, they can type \"quit\" and the program will reveal the correct number.\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is a valid integer and if it's within the correct range.\n4. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.\n5. If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program gives the user a hint and asks for another guess.",
