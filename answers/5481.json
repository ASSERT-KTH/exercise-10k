  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that finds the maximum number in an array of integers:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the maximum number in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum number in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array is empty\")\n\n    max_num = arr[0]\n    for num in arr:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n\n    return max_num\n\n# Test the function\narr = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1]\nprint(\"Maximum number in the array:\", find_max(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `find_max` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number.\n*   It first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, the function raises a `ValueError`.\n*   It initializes the `max_num` variable with the first element of the array.\n*   The function then iterates over the array. If it finds a number greater than the current `max_num`, it updates `max_num`.\n*   Finally, the function returns `max_num`, which is the maximum number in the array.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the program iterates over the array once.\n\n### Space Complexity:\n\n*   The space complexity of this program is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array. The program only uses a constant amount of space to store the `max_num` variable.",
