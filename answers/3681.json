  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input:\n\n```python\n# Define a function for each operation\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of x and y.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of x and y.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of x and y.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    # Get user input for operation\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4): \")\n        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            break\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number from 1 to 4.\")\n\n    # Get user input for numbers\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if choice == '1':\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        try:\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}\")\n        except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n            print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works:\n\n1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines four functions, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, which take two numbers as input and return the result of the corresponding operation.\n2. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It prints a menu of available operations and asks the user to choose one.\n3. **User Input**: The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) and two valid numbers.\n4. **Operation Selection**: Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding function with the two input numbers and prints the result.\n5. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling to catch invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input) and division by zero.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n1. Run the program and choose an operation (e.g., addition).\n2. Enter two numbers (e.g., 2 and 3).\n3. The program will print the result of the operation (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).",
