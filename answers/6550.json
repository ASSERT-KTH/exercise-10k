  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings. It uses Python's built-in `zip` function to iterate over the characters of the strings in parallel, and stops as soon as it finds a mismatch.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strings (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strings:\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = []\n    for chars in zip(*strings):\n        if len(set(chars)) == 1:\n            prefix.append(chars[0])\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return \"\".join(prefix)\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"hello world\", \"hello python\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hello\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes a list of strings as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty string.\n3. It initializes an empty list `prefix` to store the characters of the common prefix.\n4. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of the strings in parallel.\n5. For each set of characters, it checks if all characters are the same (i.e., if the length of the set of characters is 1). If they are, it adds the character to the `prefix` list.\n6. If the characters are not the same, it breaks out of the loop.\n7. Finally, it joins the characters in the `prefix` list into a string and returns it.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings. This is because the `zip` function stops as soon as it reaches the end of the shortest string.",
