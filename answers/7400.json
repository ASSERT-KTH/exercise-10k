  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern should start with 1 and end with the input number. Each line of the pattern should contain one more number than the previous line, and the numbers on each line should increase by 1. For example, if the input is 6, the pattern should look like this: 1, 2 3, 4 5 6",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of numbers from 1 to n.\n    \n    The pattern starts with 1 and ends with n. Each line of the pattern contains \n    one more number than the previous line, and the numbers on each line increase \n    by 1.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number up to which the pattern should be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 1\n    line_length = 1\n    \n    while num <= n:\n        # Print numbers for the current line\n        for _ in range(line_length):\n            if num <= n:\n                print(num, end=\" \")\n                num += 1\n        \n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n        line_length += 1\n\n\n# Example usage\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint_pattern(n)\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n- It takes an integer `n` as input from the user.\n- It initializes two variables: `num` to keep track of the current number being printed, and `line_length` to keep track of the number of elements in the current line.\n- The outer while loop continues until `num` exceeds `n`.\n- Inside the while loop, a for loop prints `line_length` numbers.\n- After each line, it increments `line_length` by 1 and moves to the next line.\n- The example usage shows how to use the `print_pattern` function with user input.",
