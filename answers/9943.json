Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **StudentGrades Class**: The `StudentGrades` class is defined to manage student grades. It has methods to add students, add subject grades, and calculate average grades.\n2. **add_student Method**: This method adds a new student to the `grades` dictionary. If the student already exists, it displays a message indicating that.\n3. **add_subject_grade Method**: This method adds a new subject grade for an existing student. If the subject does not exist for the student, it creates a new list for the subject and adds the grade. If the subject already exists, it appends the new grade to the list.\n4. **calculate_average_grade Method**: This method calculates the average grade for a student in a specific subject or overall. If no subject is specified, it calculates the overall average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the total count of grades.\n5. **main Function**: The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the `StudentGrades` class. It allows users to add students, add subject grades, calculate average grades, or exit the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Add a new student: Choose option 1 and enter the student's name.\n* Add a new subject grade: Choose option 2,",
