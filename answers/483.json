  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a reduction function as input, and returns the result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef reduction_function(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef reduce(array, function):\n    result = None\n    for element in array:\n        if result is None:\n            result = element\n        else:\n            result = function(result, element)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = reduce(array, reduction_function)\n    print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `reduction_function` that adds two numbers together, the `reduce` function that applies the reduction function to all elements in the array, and the `main` function that demonstrates the usage of the `reduce` function with the provided array. The output of the program will be `15`, which is the sum of all elements in the array.",
