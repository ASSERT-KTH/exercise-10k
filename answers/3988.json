  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n=====================================================\n\nThis program uses a sliding window approach with a set data structure to efficiently find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    char_set = set()\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n\n    return max_length\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    s = \"abcabcbb\"\n    print(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters: {length_of_longest_substring(s)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Initialize an empty set `char_set` to store unique characters in the current substring.\n2.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.\n3.  Initialize `max_length` to store the maximum length of substring without repeating characters.\n4.  Iterate over the string using the `right` pointer.\n5.  If the character at the `right` pointer is already in `char_set`, remove characters from the `left` pointer until the character at the `right` pointer is not in `char_set`.\n6.  Add the character at the `right` pointer to `char_set`.\n7.  Update `max_length` if the current window size is larger.\n8.  Return `max_length` after iterating over the entire string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because each character is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set, because in the worst case, the set will store all unique characters in the string.",
