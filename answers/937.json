  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program creates a simple weather forecast using if/else statements. It takes the current temperature and precipitation as input and outputs a weather forecast.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_weather_forecast(temperature, precipitation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a weather forecast based on temperature and precipitation.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    temperature (float): Current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n    precipitation (float): Current precipitation in mm.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: Weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > 25:\n        if precipitation > 0:\n            return \"Hot and rainy\"\n        else:\n            return \"Hot and sunny\"\n    elif temperature >= 15 and temperature <= 25:\n        if precipitation > 0:\n            return \"Mild and rainy\"\n        else:\n            return \"Mild and sunny\"\n    else:\n        if precipitation > 0:\n            return \"Cold and rainy\"\n        else:\n            return \"Cold and sunny\"\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter current temperature (\u00b0C): \"))\n    precipitation = float(input(\"Enter current precipitation (mm): \"))\n    \n    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature, precipitation)\n    print(\"Weather Forecast:\", forecast)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the temperature is 30\u00b0C and precipitation is 0 mm, the output will be: \"Hot and sunny\"\n*   If the temperature is 20\u00b0C and precipitation is 10 mm, the output will be: \"Mild and rainy\"\n*   If the temperature is 10\u00b0C and precipitation is 0 mm, the output will be: \"Cold and sunny\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The `get_weather_forecast` function takes two parameters: `temperature` and `precipitation`.\n2.  It uses if/else statements to determine the weather forecast based on the temperature and precipitation.\n3.  If the temperature is above 25\u00b0C, it's considered hot. If the precipitation is above 0 mm, it's rainy; otherwise, it's sunny.\n4.  If the temperature is between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, it's considered mild. If the precipitation is above 0 mm, it's rainy; otherwise, it's sunny.\n5.  If the temperature is below 15\u00b0C, it's considered cold. If the precipitation is above 0 mm, it's rainy; otherwise, it's sunny.\n6.  The `main` function prompts the user to input the current temperature and precipitation.\n7.  It calls the `get_weather_forecast` function with the user input and prints the resulting weather forecast.",
