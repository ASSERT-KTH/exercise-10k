  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following is an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is less than 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    # Check if n is negative\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError`, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   For `n > 1`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1`, and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case, and it corresponds to the mathematical definition of the factorial: `n! = n * (n-1)!`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   `factorial(5)` returns `120`, since `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.\n*   `factorial(0)` returns `1`, since the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.\n*   `factorial(-1)` raises a `ValueError`, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.",
