  "answer": "**Symmetric Matrix Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given matrix is symmetric. A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its own transpose.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the matrix is equal to its transpose\n    return np.allclose(matrix, matrix.T)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]])\n    matrix2 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n    print(f\"Is matrix1 symmetric? {is_symmetric(matrix1)}\")\n    print(f\"Is matrix2 symmetric? {is_symmetric(matrix2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**: The program starts by importing the `numpy` library, which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.\n2. **Defining the `is_symmetric` Function**: This function takes a matrix as input and checks if it is symmetric.\n3. **Checking if the Matrix is Square**: A symmetric matrix must be square, so the function first checks if the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. If not, it returns `False`.\n4. **Checking if the Matrix is Equal to its Transpose**: The function then checks if the matrix is equal to its transpose using the `np.allclose` function, which returns `True` if the two matrices are element-wise equal within a tolerance.\n5. **Defining the `main` Function**: This function demonstrates the usage of the `is_symmetric` function with two example matrices.\n6. **Running the Program**: The program runs the `main` function when executed, which prints the results of the symmetry checks for the two example matrices.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking if a matrix is symmetric before performing operations that require symmetry, such as eigenvalue decomposition.\n* Verifying the symmetry of a matrix in a mathematical proof or derivation.\n* Using the `is_symmetric` function as a building block for more complex matrix operations or algorithms.",
