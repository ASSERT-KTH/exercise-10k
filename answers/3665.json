  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that compares two numbers and returns the larger one, addressing your request for a simple comparison function. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef max_of_two_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function compares two numbers and returns the maximum value.\n\n    Parameters:\n    num1 (int or float): The first number for comparison.\n    num2 (int or float): The second number for comparison.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The maximum of the two input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if both inputs are numbers\n    # We can use the isinstance function to check the type of the input\n    if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be numbers\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the built-in max function in Python to find the maximum of the two numbers\n    # The max function takes in multiple arguments and returns the largest one\n    # We pass num1 and num2 as arguments to the max function\n    max_value = max(num1, num2)\n\n    # Finally, we return the maximum value\n    return max_value\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(max_of_two_numbers(5, 10))  # Output: 10\nprint(max_of_two_numbers(-5, 0))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `max_of_two_numbers` starts by validating the input types using `isinstance` to ensure both `num1` and `num2` are either integers or floats. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes Python's built-in `max` function to find and store the larger of the two input numbers in the `max_value` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the `max_value`, which is the maximum of the two input numbers.\n* Example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different input pairs, such as `print(max_of_two_numbers(5, 10))` and `print(max_of_two_numbers(-5, 0))`.",
