  "answer": "**Cone Volume Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe volume of a cone is calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nWhere:\n- V is the volume of the cone\n- \u03c0 is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- r is the radius of the cone\n- h is the height of the cone\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cone_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cone.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cone.\n        height (float): The height of the cone.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cone.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative.\")\n\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cone: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cone: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the volume\n        volume = calculate_cone_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cone is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius and height of the cone when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and print the volume of the cone.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` library for the value of \u03c0 and the `input` function to get user input. It also includes error checking to ensure that the radius and height are non-negative.",
