  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. If the user inputs 'rock' and the computer chooses 'scissors', the user wins, and so on. Determine the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Return the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return \"User wins!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nUser chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1.  The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n2.  The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and returns the winner based on the game's rules.\n3.  In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter their choice.\n4.  The program validates the user's input to ensure it's one of the allowed choices.\n5.  The computer's choice is generated using the `get_computer_choice` function.\n6.  Both choices are printed, and the winner is determined using the `determine_winner` function.\n7.  Finally, the result is printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   User enters 'rock', and the computer chooses 'scissors'. The program outputs: \"User wins!\"\n*   User enters 'paper', and the computer chooses 'rock'. The program outputs: \"User wins!\"\n*   User enters 'scissors', and the computer chooses 'paper'. The program outputs: \"User wins!\"\n*   User and computer choose the same option. The program outputs: \"It's a tie!\"\n*   User enters an invalid choice. The program prompts the user to enter a valid choice.",
