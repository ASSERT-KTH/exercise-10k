  "answer": "**Loan Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the monthly payment for a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of payments.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_monthly_payment(principal, interest_rate, num_payments):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly payment for a loan.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount of the loan.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        num_payments (int): The number of payments.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n    monthly_payment = principal * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** num_payments / ((1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** num_payments - 1)\n    return round(monthly_payment, 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    principal = 200000  # Principal amount\n    interest_rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (5%)\n    num_payments = 360  # Number of payments (30 years \\* 12 months/year)\n\n    monthly_payment = calculate_monthly_payment(principal, interest_rate, num_payments)\n    print(f\"The monthly payment is: ${monthly_payment}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_monthly_payment` function takes in three arguments: `principal`, `interest_rate`, and `num_payments`.\n2. It calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.\n3. It then uses the formula for calculating the monthly payment, which is:\n\n   M = P \\* r \\* (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)\n\n   Where:\n   * M is the monthly payment\n   * P is the principal amount\n   * r is the monthly interest rate\n   * n is the number of payments\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_monthly_payment` function with example values.\n5. The result is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `loan_calculator.py`).\n2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python loan_calculator.py`).\n3. Modify the example values in the `main` function to calculate the monthly payment for a different loan.",
