  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of List Elements using Reduce Function**\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to calculate the sum of all elements in a list:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef calculate_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all elements in a list using reduce function.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, lst)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = calculate_sum(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of list elements:\", result)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `reduce` function takes two arguments: a lambda function and a list.\n2. The lambda function defines the operation to be performed on each pair of elements. In this case, it's a simple addition (`x + y`).\n3. The `reduce` function applies the lambda function to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until it has processed all elements.\n4. The final result is the sum of all elements in the list.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nSum of list elements: 15\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes the list only contains numbers. If the list may contain non-numeric elements, you should add error handling to ensure the function works correctly.",
