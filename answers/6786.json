  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and calculates the result. The arithmetic operations can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the result\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a `calculate` function that takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result. It also includes error checking to ensure that the operation is valid and that division by zero does not occur.\n\nThe `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result. It also catches and handles any errors that may occur during the calculation.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the two numbers and the operation. The program will then print the result of the operation.",
