  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and an element as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n\n```python\n# Example function to find the index of the first occurrence of an element in a list\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    try:\n        index = lst.index(elem)\n    except ValueError:\n        index = None\n    return index\n\n# Another example function to find the index of the first occurrence of an element in a list\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n        if x == elem:\n            return i\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\nelement = 'c'\nindex = find_index(list1, element)\nif index is not None:\n    print(f\"The index of {element} in {list1} is {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{element} is not found in {list1}.\")\n\n# Another example usage:\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nelement = 3\nindex = find_index(list2, element)\nif index is not None:\n    print(f\"The index of {element} in {list2} is {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{element} is not found in {list2}.\")\n```\n\nNote: The above code is a direct implementation of the provided specification. However, it's worth noting that the `index()` method of Python lists is generally more efficient and Pythonic than a custom loop, unless there are specific requirements that necessitate a custom implementation.",
