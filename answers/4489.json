  "answer": "**Bank Account Simulator Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python function that simulates a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative\")\n        self.balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the current balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative\")\n        elif amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the current balance of the account.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The current balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new bank account with an initial balance of $1000\n    account = BankAccount(1000)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Simulator\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            try:\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n                print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.check_balance():.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the script to start the bank account simulator.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter the amount to deposit, and the simulator will update the balance accordingly.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the amount to withdraw, and the simulator will update the balance accordingly. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance, an error message will be displayed.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current balance of the account.\n\t* Exit: Quit the simulator.\n3. Repeat steps 2 until you choose to exit the simulator.\n\nNote: This implementation uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance and provide methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. The `main` function serves as the entry point for the simulator, presenting a menu-driven interface for user interaction.",
