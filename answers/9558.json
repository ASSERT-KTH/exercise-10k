  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define the function\ndef student_grade(score):\n    # Check if the score is 90 or above\n    if score >= 90:\n        grade = \"A\"\n    # Check if the score is 80 or above\n    elif score >= 80:\n        grade = \"B\"\n    # Check if the score is 70 or above\n    elif score >= 70:\n        grade = \"C\"\n    # Check if the score is 60 or above\n    elif score >= 60:\n        grade = \"D\"\n    # If none of the above conditions are met, the grade is F\n    else:\n        grade = \"F\"\n    # Return the calculated grade\n    return grade\n\n# Get the student's score from the user\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n# Print the grade\nprint(\"Your grade is: \", student_grade(score))\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, including the comments and the indentation. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
