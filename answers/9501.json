  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the average of all elements in a given array of numbers. The program should take an array as input, sum all the elements, and then divide by the total number of elements to get the average.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef average(arr):\n    s = 0\n    for i in arr:\n        s += i\n    return s / len(arr)\n\nprint(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n```\nThis code defines a function `average` that takes an array `arr` as input, calculates the sum `s` of all elements in the array, and returns the average value by dividing `s` by the length of the array. The code then calls the `average` function with an example array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints the result to the console.",
