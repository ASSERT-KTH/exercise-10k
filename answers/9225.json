  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input from the user and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Validate the user input to ensure it is an integer and handle division by zero errors. Print the results in a formatted manner.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specification:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\n# Import the sys module\nimport sys\n\n# Get the first integer from the user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\n\n# Get the second integer from the user\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum\nsum_val = num1 + num2\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndiff_val = num1 - num2\n\n# Calculate the product\nprod_val = num1 * num2\n\n# Check if num2 is zero before calculating the quotient\nif num2 == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    sys.exit()\nelse:\n    quot_val = num1 / num2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Sum:\", sum_val)\nprint(\"Difference:\", diff_val)\nprint(\"Product:\", prod_val)\nprint(\"Quotient:\", quot_val)\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they are specific to the individual writing the code. You can fill those in accordingly. Also, I've used the `sys` module to exit the program if the user tries to divide by zero, as per the specification.",
