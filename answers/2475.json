  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that compares two given strings lexicographically, providing a clear understanding of the implementation process. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compare_strings_lexicographically(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function compares two given strings lexicographically.\n    \n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string to be compared.\n        str2 (str): The second string to be compared.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: A negative integer if str1 is lexicographically smaller than str2,\n             a positive integer if str1 is lexicographically larger than str2,\n             and zero if both strings are equal.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use the built-in comparison operators in Python to compare the strings\n    # These operators compare strings lexicographically by default\n    \n    # If str1 is lexicographically smaller than str2, return -1\n    if str1 < str2:\n        return -1\n    \n    # If str1 is lexicographically larger than str2, return 1\n    elif str1 > str2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # If both strings are equal, return 0\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(compare_strings_lexicographically(\"apple\", \"banana\"))  # Output: -1\nprint(compare_strings_lexicographically(\"banana\", \"apple\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(compare_strings_lexicographically(\"apple\", \"apple\"))   # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `compare_strings_lexicographically` takes two string arguments, `str1` and `str2`, which are to be compared lexicographically.\n* It utilizes Python's built-in comparison operators (`<`, `>`) to compare the strings, which by default perform lexicographical comparisons.\n* The function returns an integer value indicating the comparison result: `-1` if `str1` is lexicographically smaller, `1` if `str1` is lexicographically larger, and `0` if both strings are equal.\n* Example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different input strings, such as \"apple\" and \"banana\", showcasing its ability to correctly determine lexicographical order.",
