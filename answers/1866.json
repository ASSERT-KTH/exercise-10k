  "answer": "**Filtering a List in Python**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that filters a list based on a condition and prints the filtered list.\n\n```python\ndef filter_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The filtered list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [item for item in input_list if condition(item)]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    # Define a condition function\n    def is_even(num):\n        return num % 2 == 0\n\n    # Filter the list\n    filtered_numbers = filter_list(numbers, is_even)\n\n    # Print the filtered list\n    print(\"Filtered list:\", filtered_numbers)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The `filter_list` function takes a list and a condition function as arguments.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the items from the input list for which the condition function returns `True`.\n3. In the example usage, we define a list of numbers and a condition function `is_even` that checks if a number is even.\n4. We then call the `filter_list` function with the list of numbers and the `is_even` condition function, and store the result in the `filtered_numbers` variable.\n5. Finally, we print the filtered list.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nFiltered list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a simple way to filter a list in Python using a condition function. You can replace the `is_even` condition function with any other condition that makes sense for your use case.",
