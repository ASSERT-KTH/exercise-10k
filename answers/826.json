  "answer": "**Longest Common Substring Problem**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven two strings, find the longest common substring and return it.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D table where each cell represents the length of the longest common substring ending at the corresponding characters in the two strings.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_substring(s1, s2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common substring between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The first string.\n        s2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common substring.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = len(s1)\n    n = len(s2)\n\n    # Create a 2D table to store the lengths of common substrings\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the maximum length and ending position\n    max_length = 0\n    end = 0\n\n    # Fill the table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n                if dp[i][j] > max_length:\n                    max_length = dp[i][j]\n                    end = i\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n\n    # Extract the longest common substring from the table\n    return s1[end - max_length: end]\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"abcdef\"\ns2 = \"zbcdfg\"\nprint(longest_common_substring(s1, s2))  # Output: \"bcd\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create a 2D table `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings.\n2. Initialize variables `max_length` and `end` to store the maximum length and ending position of the longest common substring.\n3. Fill the table in a bottom-up manner by iterating over the characters in the two strings.\n4. If the current characters match, update the length of the common substring and check if it's the longest so far.\n5. If the current characters don't match, reset the length of the common substring to 0.\n6. Extract the longest common substring from the table using the `end` and `max_length` variables.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m x n), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. This is because we need to fill the 2D table of size (m + 1) x (n + 1).\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(m x n), which is the size of the 2D table.",
