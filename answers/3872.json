  "answer": "### Filtering Countries by Continent\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that filters a dictionary of countries by continent and prints the filtered dictionary.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with countries as keys and their capitals as values\ncountries = {\n    \"France\": \"Paris\",\n    \"Germany\": \"Berlin\",\n    \"Italy\": \"Rome\",\n    \"Spain\": \"Madrid\",\n    \"China\": \"Beijing\",\n    \"Japan\": \"Tokyo\",\n    \"India\": \"New Delhi\",\n    \"United States\": \"Washington D.C.\",\n    \"Canada\": \"Ottawa\",\n    \"Mexico\": \"Mexico City\",\n    \"Brazil\": \"Bras\u00edlia\",\n    \"Argentina\": \"Buenos Aires\",\n}\n\n# Define a dictionary with countries as keys and their continents as values\ncountry_continents = {\n    \"France\": \"Europe\",\n    \"Germany\": \"Europe\",\n    \"Italy\": \"Europe\",\n    \"Spain\": \"Europe\",\n    \"China\": \"Asia\",\n    \"Japan\": \"Asia\",\n    \"India\": \"Asia\",\n    \"United States\": \"North America\",\n    \"Canada\": \"North America\",\n    \"Mexico\": \"North America\",\n    \"Brazil\": \"South America\",\n    \"Argentina\": \"South America\",\n}\n\ndef filter_countries_by_continent(countries, country_continents, continent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a dictionary of countries by continent.\n\n    Args:\n        countries (dict): A dictionary with countries as keys and their capitals as values.\n        country_continents (dict): A dictionary with countries as keys and their continents as values.\n        continent (str): The continent to filter by.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with countries in the specified continent as keys and their capitals as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    filtered_countries = {\n        country: capital\n        for country, capital in countries.items()\n        if country_continents.get(country) == continent\n    }\n    return filtered_countries\n\n# Filter the dictionary to include only countries in Europe\ncontinent = \"Europe\"\nfiltered_countries = filter_countries_by_continent(countries, country_continents, continent)\n\n# Print the filtered dictionary\nprint(f\"Countries in {continent}:\")\nprint(filtered_countries)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We define two dictionaries: `countries` with country names as keys and their capitals as values, and `country_continents` with country names as keys and their continents as values.\n2. We define a function `filter_countries_by_continent` that takes the `countries`, `country_continents`, and `continent` as arguments.\n3. Inside the function, we use a dictionary comprehension to filter the `countries` dictionary based on the `continent`.\n4. We filter the dictionary to include only countries in Europe by calling the `filter_countries_by_continent` function with the `continent` argument set to \"Europe\".\n5. Finally, we print the filtered dictionary.\n\n#### Output\n\n```\nCountries in Europe:\n{'France': 'Paris', 'Germany': 'Berlin', 'Italy': 'Rome', 'Spain': 'Madrid'}\n```",
