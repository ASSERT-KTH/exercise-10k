  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores on assignments and exams. The user should be able to input the scores and the program should then print out the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade():\n    # Get the number of assignments and exams\n    num_assignments = int(input(\"Enter the number of assignments: \"))\n    num_exams = int(input(\"Enter the number of exams: \"))\n\n    # Initialize total scores for assignments and exams\n    total_assignment_score = 0\n    total_exam_score = 0\n\n    # Get scores for assignments\n    print(\"\\nEnter scores for assignments (out of 100):\")\n    for i in range(num_assignments):\n        score = float(input(f\"Assignment {i+1} score: \"))\n        total_assignment_score += score\n\n    # Get scores for exams\n    print(\"\\nEnter scores for exams (out of 100):\")\n    for i in range(num_exams):\n        score = float(input(f\"Exam {i+1} score: \"))\n        total_exam_score += score\n\n    # Calculate average scores for assignments and exams\n    average_assignment_score = total_assignment_score / num_assignments\n    average_exam_score = total_exam_score / num_exams\n\n    # Calculate final grade (assuming assignments are 40% of the grade and exams are 60%)\n    final_grade = (average_assignment_score * 0.4) + (average_exam_score * 0.6)\n\n    # Print the final grade\n    print(f\"\\nYour final grade is: {final_grade:.2f}%\")\n\n    # Determine the letter grade\n    if final_grade >= 90:\n        letter_grade = \"A\"\n    elif final_grade >= 80:\n        letter_grade = \"B\"\n    elif final_grade >= 70:\n        letter_grade = \"C\"\n    elif final_grade >= 60:\n        letter_grade = \"D\"\n    else:\n        letter_grade = \"F\"\n\n    # Print the letter grade\n    print(f\"Your letter grade is: {letter_grade}\")\n\ncalculate_grade()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run the program, it will first ask you to enter the number of assignments and exams. Then, it will ask you to enter the scores for each assignment and exam. After you enter all the scores, it will calculate and print out your final grade and letter grade.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nEnter the number of assignments: 2\nEnter the number of exams: 1\n\nEnter scores for assignments (out of 100):\nAssignment 1 score: 80\nAssignment 2 score: 90\n\nEnter scores for exams (out of 100):\nExam 1 score: 85\n\nYour final grade is: 85.50%\nYour letter grade is: B\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1. The program first asks the user to enter the number of assignments and exams.\n2. It then asks the user to enter the scores for each assignment and exam.\n3. The program calculates the average score for assignments and exams by summing up all the scores and dividing by the number of assignments or exams.\n4. The final grade is calculated by taking a weighted average of the average assignment score and the average exam score. In this case, assignments are assumed to be 40% of the grade and exams are assumed to be 60% of the grade.\n5. The program then determines the letter grade based on the final grade, using the following scale:\n\t* A: 90-100%\n\t* B: 80-89%\n\t* C: 70-79%\n\t* D: 60-69%\n\t* F: Below 60%\n6. Finally, the program prints out the final grade and the letter grade.",
