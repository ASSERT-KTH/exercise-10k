  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two binary numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to add two binary numbers:\n\n```python\ndef add_binary(a, b):\n    # Convert binary numbers to integers, add them, and then convert back to binary\n    sum = int(a, 2) + int(b, 2)\n    return bin(sum)[2:]\n\n# Test the function\na = \"1010\"\nb = \"1100\"\nprint(\"The sum of {} and {} is {}\".format(a, b, add_binary(a, b)))\n```\n\nThis program works by first converting the binary numbers to integers with `int(a, 2)` and `int(b, 2)`, where `2` is the base of the number. It then adds the two integers together and converts the result back to a binary string with `bin(sum)`. The `[2:]` is used to remove the `'0b'` prefix that Python adds to binary numbers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use bitwise operations to add the two binary numbers without converting them to integers. Here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef add_binary(a, b):\n    # Find the maximum length between a and b\n    max_len = max(len(a), len(b))\n    a = a.zfill(max_len)\n    b = b.zfill(max_len)\n\n    result = ''\n    carry = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the binary numbers from right to left\n    for i in range(max_len-1, -1, -1):\n        bit_sum = carry\n        bit_sum += 1 if a[i] == '1' else 0\n        bit_sum += 1 if b[i] == '1' else 0\n\n        result = ('1' if bit_sum % 2 == 1 else '0') + result\n        carry = 0 if bit_sum < 2 else 1\n\n    if carry != 0:\n        result = '1' + result\n\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\na = \"1010\"\nb = \"1100\"\nprint(\"The sum of {} and {} is {}\".format(a, b, add_binary(a, b)))\n```\n\nThis program works by iterating over the binary numbers from right to left, adding corresponding bits and keeping track of any carry. The result is built from right to left, and any final carry is added to the front of the result.",
