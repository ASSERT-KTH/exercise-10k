  "prompt": "Declare a constant variable and understand its purpose",
  "answer": "**Declaring a Constant Variable**\n\nIn programming, a constant variable is a variable that holds a value that cannot be changed once it is declared. The purpose of a constant variable is to store a value that remains the same throughout the execution of a program.\n\n**Example in Python**\n```python\n# Declare a constant variable\nPI = 3.14159\n\n# Attempting to reassign a new value will result in an error\ntry:\n    PI = 2.0\nexcept AttributeError:\n    print(\"Cannot reassign a constant variable\")\n```\nHowever, Python does not have built-in support for constant variables. To achieve similar behavior, you can use the `final` type hint (Python 3.8+) or follow a naming convention (e.g., using all uppercase letters with underscores).\n\n**Updated Example in Python**\n```python\nfrom typing import Final\n\n# Declare a constant variable using the final type hint\nPI: Final = 3.14159\n\n# Attempting to reassign a new value will result in a warning\n# Note: This is not enforced at runtime, but rather by linters and IDEs\nPI = 2.0  # This will raise a warning, but not an error\n```\n**Purpose of Constant Variables**\n\nThe primary purpose of constant variables is to:\n\n1. **Improve code readability**: By using meaningful names for constant variables, you can make your code more readable and self-explanatory.\n2. **Prevent accidental changes**: By declaring a variable as constant, you can prevent accidental changes to its value, which can lead to bugs and errors.\n3. **Enhance code maintainability**: Constant variables can make it easier to modify and maintain code, as changes to the value can be made in a single location.\n\nCommon use cases for constant variables include:\n\n* Mathematical constants (e.g., PI, E)\n* Configuration values (e.g., database connection strings)\n* Magic numbers (e.g., error codes, status codes)",
