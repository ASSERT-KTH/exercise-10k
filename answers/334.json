  "answer": "**Inspecting Variables in Python**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that inspects the attributes and methods of a variable, including its type, value, and memory location.\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary modules\nimport sys\n\ndef inspect_variable(var):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inspect the attributes and methods of a variable.\n\n    Args:\n        var: The variable to be inspected.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"**Variable Type:** {type(var)}\")\n    print(f\"**Variable Value:** {var}\")\n    print(f\"**Variable Memory Location:** {id(var)}\")\n    print(f\"**Variable Size in Bytes:** {sys.getsizeof(var)}\")\n\n    # Get the attributes and methods of the variable\n    print(\"\\n**Attributes and Methods:**\")\n    for attr in dir(var):\n        if not attr.startswith('__') and not attr.endswith('__'):\n            print(f\"- {attr}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    var = \"Hello, World!\"\n    inspect_variable(var)\n\n    var = 123\n    inspect_variable(var)\n\n    var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    inspect_variable(var)\n\n    var = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    inspect_variable(var)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n------------------------\n\n1.  The `inspect_variable` function takes a variable as input and prints its type, value, and memory location using the `type()`, `id()`, and `sys.getsizeof()` functions.\n2.  The `dir()` function is used to get a list of attributes and methods of the variable. We filter out the built-in attributes and methods by checking if the attribute name starts or ends with double underscores (`__`).\n3.  In the example usage, we create variables of different types (string, integer, list, and dictionary) and pass them to the `inspect_variable` function to demonstrate its functionality.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-------------------------\n\n*   You can modify the `inspect_variable` function to handle specific types of variables or to provide more detailed information about the variable's attributes and methods.\n*   To inspect the attributes and methods of a module or a class, you can use the `dir()` function directly on the module or class object.\n*   The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size of the variable in bytes, which can be useful for estimating memory usage.\n*   The `id()` function returns a unique identifier for the variable, which can be used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.",
