  "answer": "**Bank Account System Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a simple bank account system. This program uses a `BankAccount` class to encapsulate the account's balance and provide methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative\")\n        self.balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the current balance of the account.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The current balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.balance\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new bank account with an initial balance of $100\n    account = BankAccount(100)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account System\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n                account.deposit(amount)\n                print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n                print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Current balance: ${account.get_balance():.2f}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter a deposit amount, and the program will update the account balance.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter a withdrawal amount, and the program will update the account balance if sufficient funds are available.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Follow the prompts to perform the chosen action.\n\nNote: The program uses a simple text-based interface and does not persist account data between sessions. In a real-world application, you would likely want to store account information securely and implement additional features, such as user authentication and authorization.",
