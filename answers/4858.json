  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a sorted list and an element as input, and returns the index of the element if it exists in the list using a binary search algorithm.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on your detailed specifications:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted list using a binary search algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target (int): The element to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        guess = sorted_list[mid]\n\n        if guess == target:\n            return mid\n        elif guess > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(binary_search(my_list, 3))  # Output: 1\nprint(binary_search(my_list, 2))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis code defines a binary search function that takes a sorted list and a target element as input, and returns the index of the target element if it exists in the list, or -1 otherwise. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search space in half until it finds the target element or determines that it is not in the list. The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the binary search function with a sample list and target elements.",
