  "answer": "### Function to Calculate Average\n\nHere's a Python function to calculate the average of all numbers in a given list.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of all numbers in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of all numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if len(num_list) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Check if all elements in the list are numeric\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in num_list):\n        raise TypeError(\"List must only contain numeric values\")\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = sum(num_list) / len(num_list)\n\n    return average\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of {numbers} is: {average}\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all numbers in the list. It includes error checking to ensure the list is not empty and contains only numeric values. The average is calculated by summing all numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n#### Notes\n\n*   This function uses the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list and the `len()` function to get the count of numbers.\n*   It raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty and a `TypeError` if the list contains non-numeric values.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a list of numbers and handle potential errors.",
