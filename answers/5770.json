  "answer": "**Bank Account Simulator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program simulates a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The program uses object-oriented programming to create a `BankAccount` class, which encapsulates the account's balance and provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an optional initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account, if sufficient funds are available.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Displays the current balance of the account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()  # Create a new BankAccount object\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Simulator Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to deposit $100.\n2. Select option 2 to withdraw $50.\n3. Select option 3 to check the current balance.\n4. Select option 4 to quit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based menu for user interaction. You can modify the program to use a more advanced GUI or command-line interface if desired.",
