  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python to calculate the discount amount and the final price of a product given the original price and discount percentage.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate discount and final price\ndef calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    # Calculate discount amount\n    discount_amount = (original_price * discount_percentage) / 100\n    \n    # Calculate final price\n    final_price = original_price - discount_amount\n    \n    return discount_amount, final_price\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Input original price and discount percentage\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price of the product: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate discount and final price\n    discount_amount, final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Input Original Price and Discount Percentage**: The user is prompted to enter the original price of the product and the discount percentage.\n2. **Calculate Discount Amount**: The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price with the discount percentage and then dividing by 100.\n3. **Calculate Final Price**: The final price is calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.\n4. **Print Results**: The original price, discount percentage, discount amount, and final price are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Original Price: $100\n* Discount Percentage: 20%\n* Discount Amount: $20\n* Final Price: $80\n\nThis program can be used in various e-commerce applications where you need to calculate the discount amount and the final price of a product given the original price and discount percentage.",
