  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game uses a while loop to keep playing rounds until the user decides to quit.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the round.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\"\"\"\n    user_score = 0\n    computer_score = 0\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'quit':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win this round.\")\n            user_score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins this round.\")\n            computer_score += 1\n        print(f\"\\nScore - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\\n\")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n1. Run the script.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit) when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner of the round will be determined.\n4. The score will be updated and displayed after each round.\n5. To quit the game, simply type \"quit\" when prompted for your choice.\n\nThis code provides a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, using a while loop to continue playing rounds until the user decides to quit. The `get_computer_choice` function generates the computer's random choice, and the `determine_winner` function determines the winner of each round based on the game's rules. The `play_game` function manages the game flow, including user input, scorekeeping, and displaying the results.",
