  "prompt": "Write a program that checks the temperature and prints out whether it's hot, warm, or cold. The temperature is hot if it's above 25 degrees Celsius, warm if it's between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius, and cold if it's below 15 degrees Celsius.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_temperature(temp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the temperature and prints out whether it's hot, warm, or cold.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    temp (float): Temperature in degrees Celsius.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius\n    if temp > 25:\n        print(f\"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's hot.\")\n    \n    # Check if temperature is between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius\n    elif 15 <= temp <= 25:\n        print(f\"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's warm.\")\n    \n    # If temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius\n    else:\n        print(f\"The temperature is {temp} degrees Celsius. It's cold.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    check_temperature(temperature)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. The `check_temperature` function takes one argument: `temp`, which is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n2. It uses an if-elif-else statement to check the temperature and print out whether it's hot, warm, or cold.\n3. The `main` function asks the user for the temperature, converts it to a float, and then calls the `check_temperature` function.\n4. The program prints out a message with the temperature and whether it's hot, warm, or cold.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- If the user enters `30`, the program will print: `The temperature is 30.0 degrees Celsius. It's hot.`\n- If the user enters `20`, the program will print: `The temperature is 20.0 degrees Celsius. It's warm.`\n- If the user enters `10`, the program will print: `The temperature is 10.0 degrees Celsius. It's cold.`",
