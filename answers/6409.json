  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the specified operation. Use if/else statements to determine the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs the specified operation based on the input operator:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs the specified operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to use for the operation. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operator is not one of the four basic arithmetic operators.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operator is '/' and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if operator == '+':\n        # Perform addition\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        # Perform subtraction\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        # Perform multiplication\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        # Perform division\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        # Raise an error for invalid operators\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Please use '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\")\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operator from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the operation and print the result\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"The result of {num1} {operator} {num2} is {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        # Print any error messages\n        print(str(e))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program defines a `calculate` function that takes two numbers and an operator as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n*   The function uses if/else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the operator.\n*   It also includes error checking to handle division by zero and invalid operators.\n*   The `main` function gets the numbers and operator from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses a try/except block to catch and print any error messages that occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: `calculate(5, 3, '+')` returns `8.0`\n*   Subtraction: `calculate(10, 4, '-')` returns `6.0`\n*   Multiplication: `calculate(7, 2, '*')` returns `14.0`\n*   Division: `calculate(9, 3, '/')` returns `3.0`\n*   Division by zero: `calculate(5, 0, '/')` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`\n*   Invalid operator: `calculate(2, 3, '%')` raises a `ValueError`",
