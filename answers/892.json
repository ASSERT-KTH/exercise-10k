  "answer": "**Perfect Number Checker Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a number and checks if it's a perfect number. A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_proper_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Return a list of proper divisors of n\"\"\"\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0]\n    return divisors\n\ndef is_perfect_number(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if n is a perfect number\"\"\"\n    divisors = get_proper_divisors(n)\n    return sum(divisors) == n\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_perfect_number(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a perfect number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a perfect number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `6` (1, 2, 3 are proper divisors of 6 and 1+2+3 = 6)\n  Output: `6 is a perfect number.`\n* Input: `28` (1, 2, 4, 7, 14 are proper divisors of 28 and 1+2+4+7+14 = 28)\n  Output: `28 is a perfect number.`\n* Input: `10` (1, 2, 5 are proper divisors of 10 and 1+2+5 = 8)\n  Output: `10 is not a perfect number.`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_proper_divisors` function generates a list of proper divisors for a given number `n`.\n2. The `is_perfect_number` function checks if the sum of the proper divisors is equal to `n`.\n3. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number.\n4. The program then checks if the entered number is a perfect number and prints the result.",
