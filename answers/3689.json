  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the time difference between two given times in hours, minutes, and seconds.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the time difference between two given times in hours, minutes, and seconds:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef calculate_time_difference(time1, time2):\n    # Convert the time strings to datetime objects\n    time1 = datetime.strptime(time1, \"%H:%M:%S\")\n    time2 = datetime.strptime(time2, \"%H:%M:%S\")\n\n    # Calculate the time difference\n    time_difference = time2 - time1\n\n    # Calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds\n    hours = time_difference.seconds // 3600\n    minutes = (time_difference.seconds // 60) % 60\n    seconds = time_difference.seconds % 60\n\n    return hours, minutes, seconds\n\n\ndef main():\n    time1 = input(\"Enter the first time (HH:MM:SS): \")\n    time2 = input(\"Enter the second time (HH:MM:SS): \")\n\n    hours, minutes, seconds = calculate_time_difference(time1, time2)\n\n    print(f\"The time difference is {hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, and {seconds} seconds.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a `calculate_time_difference` function that takes two time strings as input, converts them to datetime objects, calculates the time difference, and then calculates the hours, minutes, and seconds of the time difference.\n\nThe `main` function asks the user to input two time strings, calls the `calculate_time_difference` function to calculate the time difference, and then prints the result.\n\nYou can run this program and enter two time strings in the format \"HH:MM:SS\" to calculate the time difference between them.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nEnter the first time (HH:MM:SS): 10:00:00\nEnter the second time (HH:MM:SS): 12:30:00\nThe time difference is 2 hours, 30 minutes, and 0 seconds.\n```",
