  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n#### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if the input is a non-negative integer. If not, it raises a `TypeError` or `ValueError` accordingly.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   For `n > 1`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number (in this case, 5).",
