  "prompt": "Write a program to print the current time to the console and then print the time again after a 5-second delay.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution using the `time` and `datetime` modules:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef main():\n    # Print the current time\n    print(\"Current time: \", datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\"))\n\n    # Delay for 5 seconds\n    time.sleep(5)\n\n    # Print the time again\n    print(\"Time after delay: \", datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\"))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We import the necessary modules: `time` for the delay and `datetime` for getting the current time.\n*   We define a `main` function to encapsulate the program's logic.\n*   Inside `main`, we use `datetime.now()` to get the current time and `strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\")` to format it as hours, minutes, and seconds.\n*   We print the current time to the console.\n*   We then use `time.sleep(5)` to pause the program's execution for 5 seconds.\n*   After the delay, we print the current time again.\n*   Finally, we call the `main` function if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `print_time.py`), then execute it with Python (e.g., `python print_time.py`). The program will print the current time, wait for 5 seconds, and then print the time again.",
