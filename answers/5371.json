  "answer": "**Partitioning an Array into Sub-Arrays**\n=============================================\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses list comprehension to partition an array into two or more sub-arrays based on a given condition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef partition_array(array, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partition an array into two or more sub-arrays based on a condition.\n\n    Args:\n    - array (list): The input array to be partitioned.\n    - condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n    - dict: A dictionary where the keys are the conditions and the values are the corresponding sub-arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = {}\n    for element in array:\n        key = condition(element)\n        if key not in result:\n            result[key] = []\n        result[key].append(element)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    # Partition the array into even and odd numbers\n    def is_even(x):\n        return x % 2 == 0\n\n    partitioned = partition_array(numbers, is_even)\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", partitioned[True])\n    print(\"Odd numbers:\", partitioned[False])\n\n    # Partition the array into numbers greater than 5 and less than or equal to 5\n    def is_greater_than_5(x):\n        return x > 5\n\n    partitioned = partition_array(numbers, is_greater_than_5)\n    print(\"Numbers greater than 5:\", partitioned[True])\n    print(\"Numbers less than or equal to 5:\", partitioned[False])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `partition_array` function takes an array and a condition function as input.\n*   It iterates over each element in the array and applies the condition function to it.\n*   Based on the result of the condition function, it assigns the element to a corresponding sub-array in the `result` dictionary.\n*   If the condition is not already a key in the `result` dictionary, it adds it with an empty list as its value.\n*   Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary, where each key represents a condition and its corresponding value is the sub-array of elements that satisfy that condition.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Partitioning an array of numbers into even and odd numbers.\n*   Partitioning an array of numbers into numbers greater than a certain threshold and numbers less than or equal to that threshold.\n*   Partitioning an array of strings into strings that start with a certain prefix and strings that do not.\n\nThis solution provides a flexible way to partition an array into sub-arrays based on various conditions, making it a useful tool for data processing and analysis tasks.",
