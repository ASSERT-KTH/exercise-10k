  "prompt": "Create a program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints out a personalized greeting message including their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's name and age from input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Prints a personalized greeting message with the user's name and their age in 5 years.\"\"\"\n    future_age = age + 5\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old. In 5 years, you will be {future_age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function asks the user for their name and age using the `input` function. It checks to make sure the age is a valid whole number using a `try-except` block.\n2. The `print_greeting` function takes the user's name and age as input, calculates their age in 5 years, and prints out a personalized greeting message.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's name and age, and then calls `print_greeting` to print the greeting message.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).\n\nExample use case:\n\n```\n$ python greeting.py\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are currently 30 years old. In 5 years, you will be 35 years old.\n```",
