  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input and prints out a personalized message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Gets user's name and age as input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    return name, age\n\n\ndef print_personalized_message(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a personalized message.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_personalized_message(name, age)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_info` function uses the built-in `input` function to get the user's name and age.\n* It includes error handling to ensure the age is a valid integer.\n* The `print_personalized_message` function takes the user's name and age as input and prints out a personalized message.\n* The `main` function calls `get_user_info` and `print_personalized_message` to execute the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age. After you enter your information, it will print out a personalized message.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```",
