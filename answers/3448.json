  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that implements the number guessing game.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user enters their guess, and the program provides a hint (higher or lower) after each guess.\n4. The user continues guessing until they correctly guess the number or type \"quit\" to give up.\n5. The program displays the number of attempts it took the user to guess the number correctly.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or give up.\n* The program uses a `try`-`except` block to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value.\n* The program uses an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement to provide hints to the user based on their guess.",
