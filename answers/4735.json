  "prompt": "Create a function that uses the filter function to select elements from a list that satisfy a given condition.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters elements from a list based on a given condition, and provide a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function filters elements from a list based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list from which elements are to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns True if the element satisfies the condition, False otherwise.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We'll use the built-in filter function in Python, which constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True.\n    # The filter function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable.\n    # We'll pass the condition function and the input list to the filter function.\n    filtered_iterator = filter(condition, input_list)\n\n    # The filter function returns an iterator, so we need to convert it to a list if we want to use the result as a list.\n    # We can use the list function to convert the iterator to a list.\n    filtered_list = list(filtered_iterator)\n\n    # Finally, we return the filtered list.\n    return filtered_list\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `filter_list` function takes two arguments: `input_list` (the list to filter) and `condition` (a function that determines whether an element should be included in the filtered list).\n* The `filter` function is used to create an iterator (`filtered_iterator`) that yields elements from `input_list` for which the `condition` function returns `True`.\n* The `list` function is then used to convert the `filtered_iterator` to a list (`filtered_list`), which is returned by the `filter_list` function.\n* In the example usage, a lambda function (`lambda x: x % 2 == 0`) is used as the `condition` to filter even numbers from the `numbers` list.",
