  "prompt": "Write a program that determines the weather forecast based on the temperature and humidity. If the temperature is above 25\u00b0C and the humidity is above 60%, the forecast is 'Rain'. If the temperature is below 15\u00b0C and the humidity is below 40%, the forecast is 'Sunny'. If the temperature and humidity are between these ranges, the forecast is 'Cloudy'.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\n# Importing Libraries\nimport sys\n\n# Defining Variables\ntemperature = 20\nhumidity = 80\n\n# Defining the Function\ndef forecast(temperature, humidity):\n    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return 'Rain'\n    elif temperature < 15 and humidity < 40:\n        return 'Sunny'\n    else:\n        return 'Cloudy'\n\n# Calling the Function\nf = forecast(temperature, humidity)\n\n# Printing the Result\nprint(f)\n```\nThis code defines the `forecast` function, which takes two parameters: `temperature` and `humidity`. It then uses conditional statements to determine the weather forecast based on the given conditions. The function returns a string representing the forecast, which is then printed to the console.",
