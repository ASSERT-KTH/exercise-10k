  "answer": "**Age Validator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program will ask the user for their age and validate if the input is a positive integer.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef get_age():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's age and validate if it's a positive integer.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age <= 0:\n                print(\"Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                return age\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    age = get_age()\n    print(f\"Your age is: {age}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `get_age` function is used to get the user's age and validate if it's a positive integer.\n2. The function uses a `while` loop to continuously ask for input until a valid age is entered.\n3. The `try` block attempts to convert the input to an integer. If successful, it checks if the age is positive. If not, it displays an error message.\n4. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a string or a floating-point number), a `ValueError` exception is raised, and an error message is displayed.\n5. Once a valid age is entered, the function returns the age.\n6. The `main` function calls `get_age` to get the user's age and then prints it.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Valid input: If the user enters `25`, the program will print `Your age is: 25`.\n* Invalid input: If the user enters `abc`, the program will print `Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.` and ask for input again.\n* Negative input: If the user enters `-1`, the program will print `Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.` and ask for input again.",
