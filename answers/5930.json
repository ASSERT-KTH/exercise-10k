  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a target element as input, and finds the index of the target element in the list. If the target element is not in the list, return -1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_index(lst, target):\n    if target in lst:\n        return lst.index(target)\n    else:\n        return -1\n\nprint(find_index([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 3))  # Output: 3\nprint(find_index([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 10))  # Output: -1\n```\nThis code defines a function `find_index` that takes a list `lst` and a target element `target` as input. It checks if the target element is in the list using the `in` operator. If the target element is in the list, it returns the index of the target element using the `index()` method. If the target element is not in the list, it returns -1.\n\nThe code also includes two example use cases of the function, which demonstrate its usage and output.",
