  "answer": "**Word Counter Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the number of words in the string. It uses the `split()` method to divide the string into a list of words and then returns the length of that list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of words in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = input_string.split()\n    return len(words)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    word_count = count_words(input_string)\n    print(\"Number of words:\", word_count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a string when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is a test\").\n3. The program will print the number of words in the string (e.g., \"Number of words: 6\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program considers punctuation as part of a word. If you want to remove punctuation, you can use the `re` module to replace punctuation characters with spaces before splitting the string.\n* This program also considers contractions as a single word. If you want to count contractions as two words, you will need to use a more complex approach, such as using a natural language processing library.",
