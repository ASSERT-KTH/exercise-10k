  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    elif year % 100 != 0:\n        return True\n    elif year % 400 != 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if a year is a leap year by applying the following rules:\n   * The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n   * If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year and then calls `is_leap_year` to determine whether the year is a leap year.\n3. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will output \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will output \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000): The program will output \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900): The program will output \"1900 is not a leap year.\"",
