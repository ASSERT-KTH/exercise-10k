  "answer": "**Symmetric Difference Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the symmetric difference of two lists of numbers. The symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The symmetric difference of the two lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1) ^ set(list2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n    print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n\n    symmetric_diff = symmetric_difference(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Symmetric Difference:\", symmetric_diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `symmetric_difference` function takes two lists as input and converts them to sets.\n2. The `^` operator is used to calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets.\n3. The result is converted back to a list and returned.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `symmetric_difference` function with two example lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nList 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nList 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nSymmetric Difference: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the symmetric difference list may vary due to the unordered nature of sets.",
