  "answer": "**Student Average and Highest Grade Calculator**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of all students and finds the student(s) with the highest grade.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of all students.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary containing student information, where each key is a student's name and each value is their grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade of all students.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_grade = sum(students.values())\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(students)\n    return average_grade\n\n\ndef find_highest_grade_students(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the student(s) with the highest grade.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary containing student information, where each key is a student's name and each value is their grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of student names with the highest grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_grade = max(students.values())\n    highest_grade_students = [name for name, grade in students.items() if grade == max_grade]\n    return highest_grade_students\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    students = {\n        \"John\": 85,\n        \"Alice\": 92,\n        \"Bob\": 78,\n        \"Charlie\": 92,\n        \"David\": 88\n    }\n\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(students)\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n    highest_grade_students = find_highest_grade_students(students)\n    print(f\"Student(s) with the highest grade: {highest_grade_students}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a dictionary of students as input and returns the average grade.\n2. The `find_highest_grade_students` function takes a dictionary of students as input and returns a list of student names with the highest grade.\n3. In the `main` function, we create an example dictionary of students and calculate the average grade and find the student(s) with the highest grade.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nAverage grade: 87.00\nStudent(s) with the highest grade: ['Alice', 'Charlie']\n```",
