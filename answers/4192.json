  "answer": "**Leaderboard Generation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates a leaderboard for a game, ranking players by their score in descending order.\n\n### Function Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_leaderboard(player_scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a leaderboard for a game, ranking players by their score.\n\n    Args:\n    player_scores (dict): A dictionary where keys are player names and values are their scores.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of tuples containing the player name and score, sorted in descending order by score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the player scores in descending order\n    sorted_scores = sorted(player_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Return the sorted list of player scores\n    return sorted_scores\n\n\ndef print_leaderboard(leaderboard):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the leaderboard in a formatted manner.\n\n    Args:\n    leaderboard (list): A list of tuples containing the player name and score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Print the leaderboard header\n    print(\"Leaderboard:\")\n    print(\"Rank | Player Name | Score\")\n\n    # Print each player's rank, name, and score\n    for i, (player, score) in enumerate(leaderboard, start=1):\n        print(f\"{i:4} | {player:12} | {score:5}\")\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    player_scores = {\n        \"John\": 100,\n        \"Alice\": 120,\n        \"Bob\": 90,\n        \"Charlie\": 110\n    }\n\n    leaderboard = generate_leaderboard(player_scores)\n    print_leaderboard(leaderboard)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_leaderboard` function takes a dictionary of player scores as input and returns a list of tuples containing the player name and score, sorted in descending order by score.\n2. The `print_leaderboard` function takes the sorted leaderboard as input and prints it in a formatted manner, displaying each player's rank, name, and score.\n3. In the example usage, we create a dictionary of player scores and pass it to the `generate_leaderboard` function to generate the leaderboard.\n4. We then pass the generated leaderboard to the `print_leaderboard` function to print it.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nLeaderboard:\nRank | Player Name | Score\n   1 |      Alice |   120\n   2 |    Charlie |   110\n   3 |       John |   100\n   4 |        Bob |    90\n```",
