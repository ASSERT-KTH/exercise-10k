  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_gcd` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.\n3. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n4. The function returns the absolute value of `a` to handle cases where the input numbers are negative.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example usage section, we calculate the GCD of 48 and 18, which is 6.",
