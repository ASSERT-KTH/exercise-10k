  "answer": "### Creating a Dictionary Using Dictionary Comprehension\n\nYou can create a dictionary using dictionary comprehension in Python. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef create_dictionary(keys, values):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a dictionary using dictionary comprehension.\n\n    Args:\n        keys (list): A list of keys for the dictionary.\n        values (list): A list of values for the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is mapped to a corresponding value.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in zip(keys, values)}\n\n# Example usage:\nkeys = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\n\nresult = create_dictionary(keys, values)\nprint(result)  # Output: {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `create_dictionary` function takes two lists, `keys` and `values`, as input and returns a dictionary where each key is mapped to a corresponding value using dictionary comprehension.\n\nNote that the `zip` function is used to iterate over the `keys` and `values` lists in parallel, which is a common pattern when working with dictionary comprehension.\n\n### Alternative Example: Squaring Numbers\n\nHere's another example that demonstrates how to use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key is a number and its corresponding value is the square of that number:\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a dictionary where each key is a number and its corresponding value is the square of that number.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is a number and its corresponding value is the square of that number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {num: num ** 2 for num in numbers}\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = square_numbers(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `square_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a number and its corresponding value is the square of that number using dictionary comprehension.",
