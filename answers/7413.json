  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a user's name and age as input. Validate the age to ensure it's within the range of 1 to 120. If the age is valid, output a greeting message with the user's name and age, formatted as 'Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.' Otherwise, output an error message indicating that the age is invalid.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef validate_age(age):\n    \"\"\"Validate if the age is within the range of 1 to 120.\"\"\"\n    return 1 <= age <= 120\n\n\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age as input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if validate_age(age):\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid age. Age should be between 1 and 120.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    return name, age\n\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message with the user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program is divided into four functions:\n\n1.  `validate_age(age)`: Checks if the age is within the valid range of 1 to 120.\n2.  `get_user_info()`: Prompts the user to input their name and age. It validates the age using the `validate_age(age)` function and ensures that the input is a valid integer. If the age is invalid, it displays an error message and asks for the age again.\n3.  `print_greeting(name, age)`: Prints a greeting message with the user's name and age.\n4.  `main()`: Calls the `get_user_info()` function to get the user's name and age, and then calls the `print_greeting(name, age)` function to print the greeting message.\n\nThe `main()` function is called when the script is run directly (not imported as a module in another script).\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age. If you enter a valid age, it will display a greeting message. If you enter an invalid age, it will display an error message and ask for the age again.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 25\nHello, John! You are 25 years old.\n```",
