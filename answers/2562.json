Try again.\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `guess_number()` that contains the game logic.\n*   We generate a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n*   We use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they guess the correct number.\n*   We validate the user's input to ensure it's a valid integer between 1 and 100.\n*   After each guess, we provide feedback in the form of \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\" to help the user narrow down the range.\n*   Once the user guesses the correct number, we congratulate them and display the number of attempts it took.",
