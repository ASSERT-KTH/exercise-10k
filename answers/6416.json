  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes the current weather as input and prints out a forecast based on the weather conditions.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_forecast(weather):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a forecast based on the current weather.\n\n    Args:\n        weather (str): The current weather (e.g. \"sunny\", \"rainy\", \"cloudy\", etc.)\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A forecast for the next day\n    \"\"\"\n    if weather.lower() == \"sunny\":\n        return \"Expect a clear sky with plenty of sunshine tomorrow.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"rainy\":\n        return \"There's a chance of scattered showers tomorrow, so don't forget your umbrella.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"cloudy\":\n        return \"It's likely to be overcast tomorrow, with a high chance of light drizzle.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"windy\":\n        return \"Hold onto your hat, as tomorrow is expected to be quite gusty.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"snowy\":\n        return \"Get your scarf and gloves ready, as tomorrow is expected to be cold and snowy.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unable to determine forecast for unknown weather condition.\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current weather from the user\n    weather = input(\"Enter the current weather: \")\n\n    # Get the forecast\n    forecast = get_forecast(weather)\n\n    # Print the forecast\n    print(forecast)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters \"sunny\", the program will output: \"Expect a clear sky with plenty of sunshine tomorrow.\"\n* If the user enters \"rainy\", the program will output: \"There's a chance of scattered showers tomorrow, so don't forget your umbrella.\"\n* If the user enters an unknown weather condition, the program will output: \"Unable to determine forecast for unknown weather condition.\"\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `weather_forecast.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program by typing `python weather_forecast.py`.\n4. Enter the current weather when prompted.\n5. The program will output a forecast based on the input weather.",
