  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd using if/else conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses if/else conditional statements to check if a given number is even or odd:\n\n```\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(num, \"is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(num, \"is odd.\")\n\n# Test the function\ncheck_even_odd(10)\ncheck_even_odd(11)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `check_even_odd` function takes an integer `num` as input and checks if it is even or odd. The `if` statement checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is 0. If it is, then `num` is even. Otherwise, it is odd.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `num % 2` expression calculates the remainder of `num` divided by 2.\n2. The `if` statement checks if the remainder is 0. If it is, then `num` is even.\n3. If the remainder is not 0, then `num` is odd.\n4. The `print` statement outputs whether `num` is even or odd.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* `check_even_odd(10)` outputs: `10 is even.`\n* `check_even_odd(11)` outputs: `11 is odd.`\n\nNote: This program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of the division of `num` by 2. This is a common technique for checking if a number is even or odd.",
