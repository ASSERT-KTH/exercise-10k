  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements from both arrays interleaved.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef interleave(arr1, arr2):\n    result = []\n    while arr1 and arr2:\n        result.append(arr1.pop(0))\n        result.append(arr2.pop(0))\n    result += arr1\n    result += arr2\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\narr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nprint(interleave(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']\n```\nThis code defines the `interleave` function, which takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements from both arrays interleaved. The function uses a while loop to pop elements from the front of both arrays and append them to the `result` array, alternating between the two arrays. Once one of the arrays is empty, the remaining elements from the other array are appended to the end of the `result` array. The function then returns the `result` array.",
