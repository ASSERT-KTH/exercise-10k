  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a function and a list as arguments and applies the function to each element in the list.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a Python function that applies a given function to each element in a list, providing a step-by-step breakdown of how it works. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_function(func, lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to each element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        lst (list): The list whose elements will be transformed by the function.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with the results of applying the function to each element in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of applying the function to each element.\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list.\n    for element in lst:\n        # Apply the function to the current element and append the result to the result list.\n        result.append(func(element))\n\n    # Return the result list.\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a simple function that squares its input.\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Create a list of numbers.\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Apply the square function to each number in the list.\nsquares = apply_function(square, numbers)\n\n# Print the result.\nprint(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes in a function `func` and a list `lst` as arguments. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the results of applying `func` to each element in `lst`.\n* It iterates over each element in `lst` using a for loop, applies `func` to the current element, and appends the result to the `result` list.\n* The function returns the `result` list, which contains the results of applying `func` to each element in `lst`.\n* In the example usage, a simple function `square` is defined to square its input, and a list of numbers is created. The `apply_function` is then used to apply the `square` function to each number in the list, and the result is printed.",
