  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a 2D array and a target value as input, then returns the row and column indices of the target value if found. If the target value is not found, return a message indicating that the value is not present in the array.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that searches for a target value in a 2D array and returns its indices or a message indicating that the value is not present. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_target(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for a target value in a 2D array and returns its indices.\n    \n    Args:\n        array (list): A 2D list of values.\n        target: The value to be searched in the array.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: The row and column indices of the target value if found. Otherwise, a message indicating that the value is not present in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the array\n    for i, row in enumerate(array):\n        \n        # Check if the target value is in the current row\n        if target in row:\n            \n            # If the target value is found, return its indices\n            return (i, row.index(target))\n    \n    # If the target value is not found after iterating over all rows, return a message indicating that the value is not present\n    return \"Target value not found in the array\"\n\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\ntarget = 5\nprint(find_target(array, target))  # Output: (1, 1)\n\ntarget = 10\nprint(find_target(array, target))  # Output: Target value not found in the array\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `find_target` takes a 2D `array` and a `target` value as input and iterates over each row in the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the row values.\n*   Inside the loop, it checks if the `target` value is present in the current row using the `in` operator. If the `target` is found, it returns a tuple containing the row index `i` and the column index obtained using the `index` method of the row list.\n*   If the `target` value is not found after iterating over all rows, the function returns a message indicating that the value is not present in the array.",
