  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the maximum of a list of numbers using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the maximum of a list of numbers using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_max(numbers):\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    i = 1\n    while i < len(numbers):\n        if numbers[i] > max_num:\n            max_num = numbers[i]\n        i += 1\n    return max_num\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]\nprint(\"The maximum number in the list is:\", calculate_max(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_max` function takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n* The `max_num` variable is initialized with the first number in the list. \n* The while loop starts from the second number in the list (index 1) and compares each number with the current `max_num`. If a number is greater than `max_num`, it updates `max_num`.\n* The loop continues until all numbers in the list have been compared.\n* Finally, the function returns the maximum number found.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the maximum score in a list of exam scores.\n* Determine the highest price in a list of product prices.\n* Identify the largest value in a list of measurements. \n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list could be empty, you should add error checking code to handle this case.",
