  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    factorial = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        factorial *= i\n    return factorial\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is:\", calculate_factorial(num))\n```\n\n### How the code works:\n\n*   The `calculate_factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n*   It initializes a variable `factorial` to 1, which will be used to store the factorial of `n`.\n*   The function uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   Inside the loop, it multiplies the current value of `factorial` by the current number `i`.\n*   After the loop finishes, the function returns the calculated factorial.\n*   The program then asks the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using the `calculate_factorial` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n*   If the user enters the number 5, the program will output: `The factorial of 5 is: 120`\n*   If the user enters the number 3, the program will output: `The factorial of 3 is: 6`\n\n### Note:\n\n*   This program only works for non-negative integers. If the user enters a negative number or a non-integer, the program will not work correctly.\n*   For large input numbers, the program may exceed the maximum limit for integers in Python, causing an overflow error.",
