  "answer": "**Nested Conditional Statements Program**\n==========================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of nested conditional statements in Python. It will check if a person is eligible for a loan based on their age, income, and credit score.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef check_loan_eligibility(age, income, credit_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible for a loan based on their age, income, and credit score.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n        income (float): The income of the person.\n        credit_score (int): The credit score of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible for a loan, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the person is old enough to apply for a loan\n    if age >= 21:\n        # Check if the person has a sufficient income\n        if income >= 50000:\n            # Check if the person has a good credit score\n            if credit_score >= 600:\n                return True\n            else:\n                print(\"Sorry, your credit score is too low.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Sorry, your income is too low.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you are too young to apply for a loan.\")\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    age = 25\n    income = 60000\n    credit_score = 700\n    if check_loan_eligibility(age, income, credit_score):\n        print(\"Congratulations, you are eligible for a loan!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you are not eligible for a loan.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `check_loan_eligibility` function takes in three parameters: `age`, `income`, and `credit_score`.\n2. It checks if the person is old enough to apply for a loan (21 years or older) using an `if` statement.\n3. If the person is old enough, it checks if they have a sufficient income (at least $50,000) using another `if` statement.\n4. If the person has a sufficient income, it checks if they have a good credit score (at least 600) using another `if` statement.\n5. If all conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the person is eligible for a loan.\n6. If any condition is not met, the function prints an error message and returns `False`.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `check_loan_eligibility` function with example values.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* A 25-year-old person with an income of $60,000 and a credit score of 700 is eligible for a loan.\n* A 20-year-old person with an income of $40,000 and a credit score of 500 is not eligible for a loan due to their age and low credit score.\n* A 30-year-old person with an income of $40,000 and a credit score of 700 is not eligible for a loan due to their low income.",
