  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a mathematical operation and two numbers, then performs the operation based on the user's input using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform mathematical operations\ndef perform_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a mathematical operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operation (str): The mathematical operation to perform. Can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == '+':\n        # If the operation is '+', return the sum of the two numbers\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        # If the operation is '-', return the difference of the two numbers\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        # If the operation is '*', return the product of the two numbers\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        # If the operation is '/', return the quotient of the two numbers\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        # If the operation is not recognized, raise a ValueError\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\")\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers and operation from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the mathematical operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to perform the operation\n        result = perform_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        # Handle division by zero\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        # Handle invalid operation\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `perform_operation` function takes two numbers and a mathematical operation as input and returns the result of the operation.\n*   The function uses conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input.\n*   The `main` function gets the two numbers and operation from the user, attempts to perform the operation, and handles any errors that may occur.\n*   The program uses `try-except` blocks to catch and handle `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised during the execution of the program.",
