  "answer": "Here is a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.\n\n```python\n# Tic Tac Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the board with empty spaces\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the current state of the board.\n    \"\"\"\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef has_won(player):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given player has won the game.\n    \n    Args:\n        player (str): The symbol of the player (either 'X' or 'O').\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the player has won, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] == player:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_draw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the game is a draw.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the game is a draw, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ' ' not in board\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        if has_won(current_player):\n            print_board()\n            print(\"Player {} wins!

The game board is printed to the console, and players are prompted to enter their moves by typing the number of the space where they'd like to place their piece (1-9). The game checks for a winner after each move and announces the winner or a draw when the game is over.",
