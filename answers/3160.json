  "answer": "**Next Greater Element Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following function uses a stack to find the next greater element for each element in an array.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef next_greater_element(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the next greater element for each element in an array.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of next greater elements. If no greater element is found, -1 is returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    result = [-1] * len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack\n        while stack and arr[i] > arr[stack[-1]]:\n            # Pop the top of the stack and update the result\n            idx = stack.pop()\n            result[idx] = arr[i]\n        # Push the current index to the stack\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [4, 5, 2, 10]\nprint(next_greater_element(arr))  # Output: [5, 10, 10, -1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack and a result list with the same length as the input array, filled with -1.\n2. Iterate through the array. For each element:\n   * While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack:\n     + Pop the top of the stack and update the result list with the current element.\n   * Push the current index to the stack.\n3. Return the result list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n* The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, the stack can contain n elements. The result list also requires O(n) space.",
