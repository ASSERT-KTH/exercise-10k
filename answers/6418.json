  "answer": "**Bank Account Simulator**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a bank account. It uses if/else statements to determine the transaction type and perform the corresponding action.\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an optional initial balance.\n        \n        Args:\n            balance (float, optional): The initial balance. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Simulator\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose a transaction: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid transaction.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose a transaction by entering the corresponding number.\n3. Follow the prompts to complete the transaction.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you choose to exit the program.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account balance and provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.\n* The `main` function implements a simple text-based interface for user interaction.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n* Error handling is implemented to prevent invalid transactions, such as withdrawing more than the available balance.",
