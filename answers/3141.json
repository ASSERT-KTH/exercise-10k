  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number `n`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 == 0)\n    return even_sum\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    n = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = sum_even_numbers(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` using a generator expression.\n2. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sum_even_numbers` function by asking the user to input a number and then printing the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `n = 10`\nOutput: `The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30` (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30)\n* Input: `n = 20`\nOutput: `The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: 110` (2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 20 = 110)\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `even_sum.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python even_sum.py`). Follow the prompt to input a number, and the program will print the sum of all even numbers from 1 to that number.",
