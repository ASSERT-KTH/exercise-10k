  "prompt": "Write a program to print the elements of a list that meet a specific condition (e.g. numbers greater than 3) using a while loop",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a while loop to print the elements of a list that meet a specific condition:\n\n```python\ndef print_elements(lst, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the elements of a list that meet a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to iterate over.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lst):\n        if condition(lst[i]):\n            print(lst[i])\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\ncondition = lambda x: x > 3\n\nprint(\"Numbers greater than 3:\")\nprint_elements(numbers, condition)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_elements` function takes a list `lst` and a condition function `condition`. It uses a while loop to iterate over the list, and for each element, it checks if the condition is met. If the condition is met, it prints the element.\n\nThe example usage shows how to use the `print_elements` function to print the numbers in the `numbers` list that are greater than 3. The condition is defined as a lambda function that takes a number `x` and returns `True` if `x` is greater than 3, and `False` otherwise.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print:\n```\nNumbers greater than 3:\n4\n5\n6\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to use a while loop to iterate over a list and print elements that meet a specific condition. The condition can be any function that takes an element and returns a boolean.",
