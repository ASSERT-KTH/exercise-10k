  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the temperature as input and prints out a weather forecast based on the following conditions: hot (above 25), warm (15-24), cool (5-14), cold (below 5).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a weather forecast based on the given temperature.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (int): The temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if temperature > 25:\n        print(\"The weather is hot.\")\n    elif 15 <= temperature <= 24:\n        print(\"The weather is warm.\")\n    elif 5 <= temperature <= 14:\n        print(\"The weather is cool.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The weather is cold.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the temperature from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            temperature = int(input(\"Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Print out the weather forecast\n    weather_forecast(temperature)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `weather_forecast` function takes an integer temperature as input and prints out the corresponding weather forecast.\n2. The `main` function gets the temperature from the user, calls the `weather_forecast` function, and handles invalid inputs.\n3. The temperature ranges are defined as follows:\n   - Hot: above 25 degrees Celsius\n   - Warm: between 15 and 24 degrees Celsius (inclusive)\n   - Cool: between 5 and 14 degrees Celsius (inclusive)\n   - Cold: below 5 degrees Celsius\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `30`, the program will print: `The weather is hot.`\n* If the user enters `20`, the program will print: `The weather is warm.`\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print: `The weather is cool.`\n* If the user enters `0`, the program will print: `The weather is cold.`",
