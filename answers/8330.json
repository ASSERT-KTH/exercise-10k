  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, along with their squares. The output should be in the format 'Number: X, Square: Y', where X is the number and Y is the square of the number.",
  "answer": "Based on the detailed specification, here is the code that meets all the requirements:\n```\n# Write a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, along with their squares.\n# The output should be in the format 'Number: X, Square: Y', where X is the number and Y is the square of the number.\n\n# Define a variable to keep track of the current number\ni = 1\n\n# Start a while loop that continues as long as the current number is less than or equal to 10\nwhile i <= 10:\n    # Calculate the square of the current number\n    square = i ** 2\n\n    # Print out the current number and its square in the desired format\n    print(\"Number: \" + str(i) + \", Square: \" + str(square))\n\n    # Increment the current number by 1\n    i = i + 1\n```\nThis code follows the exact structure and logic described in the specification, using a while loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10, calculating the square of each number, and printing out the result in the desired format.",
