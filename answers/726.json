  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and outputs the distance between them.",
  "answer": "Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented code in Python that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): The coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (list): The coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    squared_distance = sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2))\n    distance = math.sqrt(squared_distance)\n\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    point2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_distance` function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space.\n*   It first checks if both points have the same number of dimensions. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   Then, it calculates the squared distance by summing the squared differences of corresponding coordinates.\n*   Finally, it returns the square root of the squared distance, which is the Euclidean distance.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of the `calculate_distance` function.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This code assumes that the input points are lists of numbers. You may want to add error checking to handle other types of input.\n*   The code uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is suitable for most applications. However, you may need to use a different distance metric depending on your specific use case.\n*   The code is designed to be reusable and flexible. You can easily modify it to calculate distances in different spaces or dimensions.",
