  "answer": "**Matrix Transpose Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a 2D array as input and returns the transposed array. The transpose of a matrix is an operator which can be thought of as \"swapping\" the rows and columns for a matrix.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transpose_matrix(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the transpose of a given 2D matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): A 2D list representing the matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The transposed matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using numpy's transpose function\n    return np.transpose(matrix).tolist()\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    matrix = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Original Matrix:\")\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(row)\n\n    transposed_matrix = transpose_matrix(matrix)\n\n    print(\"\\nTransposed Matrix:\")\n    for row in transposed_matrix:\n        print(row)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `transpose_matrix` function takes a 2D list `matrix` as input and returns its transpose.\n2. We use the `numpy` library's `transpose` function to calculate the transpose of the matrix.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `transpose_matrix` function with an example matrix.\n4. The original and transposed matrices are printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal Matrix:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[7, 8, 9]\n\nTransposed Matrix:\n[1, 4, 7]\n[2, 5, 8]\n[3, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution (without numpy)\n\nIf you don't want to use the `numpy` library, you can use the built-in `zip` function to transpose the matrix:\n\n```python\ndef transpose_matrix(matrix):\n    return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `*` operator to unpack the matrix into separate arguments to the `zip` function, effectively transposing the matrix. The `map` function is used to convert the resulting tuples back into lists.",
