  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a game of ping pong, alternating between 'ping' and 'pong' until a given number of rounds is reached.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the provided specifications:\n```\n# 1. Introduction\n# This program simulates a game of ping pong, alternating between 'ping' and 'pong'\n# until a given number of rounds is reached.\n\n# 2. Variables\nrounds = 10  # Number of rounds to simulate\ni = 0  # Counter variable\n\n# 3. While Loop\nwhile i < rounds:\n    # 4. Conditional Statement\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(\"ping\")\n    else:\n        print(\"pong\")\n    # 5. Increment Counter\n    i += 1\n```\nThis code will output:\n```\nping\npong\nping\npong\nping\npong\nping\npong\nping\npong\n```\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
