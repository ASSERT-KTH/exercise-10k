  "answer": "### Averaging Function\n#### Description\nThe `average_numbers` function calculates the average of three input numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef average_numbers(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of three numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The first number.\n        b (float): The second number.\n        c (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the three input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a + b + c) / 3\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 10\n    num2 = 20\n    num3 = 30\n    average = average_numbers(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The average of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {average}.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `average_numbers` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`, all of type `float`.\n2. It returns the sum of these three numbers divided by 3, effectively calculating the average.\n3. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with three numbers and print the result.",
