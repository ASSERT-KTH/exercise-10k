  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of factors for a given number:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of factors for a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(factors)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of factors of\", num, \"is:\", sum_of_factors(num))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `sum_of_factors` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n*   Inside the function, we create a list of factors using a list comprehension. A factor is a number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder, which we check using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).\n*   We then calculate the sum of these factors using the built-in `sum` function.\n*   In the example usage, we take a number as input from the user, call the `sum_of_factors` function, and print the result.\n\n### Optimizations\n\n*   For larger numbers, this approach can be inefficient because it checks every number up to `n`. We can optimize it by only checking up to the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than that would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n*   Here's an optimized version of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_of_factors_optimized(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of factors for a given number (optimized).\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            factors.add(i)\n            factors.add(n // i)\n    return sum(factors)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of factors of\", num, \"is:\", sum_of_factors_optimized(num))\n```\n\nIn this optimized version, we use a set to store unique factors and only iterate up to the square root of `n`. For each factor `i`, we also add its corresponding factor `n // i` to the set. Finally, we return the sum of all factors in the set.",
