  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from both lists, in the order they appeared in the input lists.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two lists into one, preserving the original order of elements. This function will take two lists as input and return a new list containing all elements from both. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef combine_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two lists into one, preserving the original order of elements.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first list to be combined.\n    list2 (list): The second list to be combined.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # First, we need to create a new empty list that will store the combined elements\n    combined_list = []\n    \n    # We'll start by adding all elements from the first list to our combined list\n    # This is done using the extend method, which adds all elements from one list to another\n    combined_list.extend(list1)\n    \n    # Now, we'll do the same for the second list, adding all its elements to our combined list\n    combined_list.extend(list2)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the combined list, which now contains all elements from both input lists\n    return combined_list\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the + operator to concatenate two lists in a more concise way\ndef combine_lists_concise(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two lists into one, preserving the original order of elements.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first list to be combined.\n    list2 (list): The second list to be combined.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We can use the + operator to concatenate the two lists directly\n    # This creates a new list containing all elements from both input lists\n    return list1 + list2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `combine_lists` function initializes an empty list `combined_list` to store the combined elements from both input lists.\n* It uses the `extend` method to add all elements from `list1` and `list2` to `combined_list`, effectively combining the two lists while preserving the original order.\n* Alternatively, the `combine_lists_concise` function achieves the same result more concisely by using the `+` operator to concatenate `list1` and `list2` directly, creating a new list with all elements from both input lists.\n* Both functions return the resulting combined list, providing the desired output.",
