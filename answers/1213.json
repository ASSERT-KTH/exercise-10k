  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of squares of all elements in a given list, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of squares of all elements in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares, starting with 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        # For each number, calculate its square and add it to the total sum\n        total_sum += num ** 2\n    \n    # After iterating over all elements, return the total sum\n    return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `sum_of_squares` that takes a list `lst` as input and initializes a variable `total_sum` to store the sum of squares, starting with 0.\n*   The function then iterates over each element `num` in the list using a for loop. For each number, it calculates its square using the exponentiation operator `** 2` and adds it to the `total_sum`.\n*   After iterating over all elements, the function returns the `total_sum`, which represents the sum of squares of all elements in the list.\n*   In the example usage, we create a list `numbers` containing integers from 1 to 5, call the `sum_of_squares` function with this list, and print the result, which is the sum of squares of these numbers.",
