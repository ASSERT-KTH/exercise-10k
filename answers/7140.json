  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. Assume the list has at least one element.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef maxListValue(inputList):\n    maxVal = inputList[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(inputList)):\n        if inputList[i] > maxVal:\n            maxVal = inputList[i]\n    return maxVal\n\n# Example usage\ninputList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(maxListValue(inputList))  # Output: 5\n```\nI've written the code in Python, as it's a concise and readable language that's well-suited for this type of problem. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
