  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n2. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.\n3. The `len` function is used to get the count of numbers in the list.\n4. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count.\n5. In the `main` function, an example list of numbers is provided, and the average is calculated and printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores.\n* Find the average temperature of a city over a period of time.\n* Compute the average cost of a set of products.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code in a file named `average_calculator.py` and run it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the example list of numbers. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
