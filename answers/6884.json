  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two integers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Introduction\nprint(\"Welcome to the Calculator Program\")\nprint(\"This program will take two integers as input and perform calculations based on the user's choice.\")\n\n# Getting Input\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Printing Options\nprint(\"Choose an operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Addition\")\nprint(\"2. Subtraction\")\nprint(\"3. Multiplication\")\nprint(\"4. Division\")\n\n# Getting User's Choice\nchoice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n# Performing Calculations\nif choice == '1':\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\nelif choice == '2':\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\nelif choice == '3':\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\nelif choice == '4':\n    if num2 == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n```\nI hope this meets the requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the code.",
