The `calculate_word_frequency` function takes a sentence as input, removes punctuation, and converts it to lower case.\n2. It then splits the sentence into words using the `split` method.\n3. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to calculate the frequency of each word.\n4. The `main` function reads a sentence from the user, calculates the word frequency, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the code and enter a sentence when prompted.\n* The program will print the frequency of each word in the sentence.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter a sentence: This is a test sentence and this sentence is a test\nWord Frequency:\nthis: 2\nis: 2\na: 2\ntest: 2\nsentence: 2\nand: 1\n```",
