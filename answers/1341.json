  "answer": "### Student Greeting Message\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that declares a variable to store a student's name and age, then prints out a greeting message:\n\n```python\n# Declare variables to store student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out a greeting message with the student's name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, my name is {student_name} and I am {student_age} years old.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We declare two variables: `student_name` to store the student's name and `student_age` to store the student's age.\n* We use an f-string to format the greeting message, which allows us to embed the variable values directly into the string.\n* The `print` function is used to output the greeting message to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.\n```\n\nYou can replace the values of `student_name` and `student_age` with your own values to see the greeting message with different student information.",
