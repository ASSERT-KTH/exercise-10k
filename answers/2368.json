  "answer": "**Arithmetic Sequence Generator**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that generates an arithmetic sequence up to a given term.\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        d (float): The common difference between terms.\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the arithmetic sequence up to the nth term.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [a + i * d for i in range(n)]\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    first_term = float(input(\"Enter the first term (a): \"))\n    common_difference = float(input(\"Enter the common difference (d): \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms (n): \"))\n\n    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)\n    print(\"Arithmetic Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first term (a) of the arithmetic sequence.\n3. Enter the common difference (d) between terms.\n4. Enter the number of terms (n) you want to generate.\n5. The program will print the arithmetic sequence up to the nth term.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nEnter the first term (a): 2\nEnter the common difference (d): 3\nEnter the number of terms (n): 5\nArithmetic Sequence:\n[2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 14.0]\n```",
