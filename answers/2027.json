  "answer": "**Leap Year Determination Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses if/else statements to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:  # Check if year is divisible by 4\n        if year % 100 == 0:  # Check if year is divisible by 100\n            if year % 400 == 0:  # Check if year is divisible by 400\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if a year is a leap year by applying the following rules:\n    * The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n    * If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible by 400.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will output \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will output \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000): The program will output \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900): The program will output \"1900 is not a leap year.\"",
