  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in the temperature and humidity and outputs the weather forecast based on the following conditions: if the temperature is above 25 and the humidity is above 60, output 'Rainy', if the temperature is above 25 and the humidity is below 60, output 'Sunny', if the temperature is below 25 and the humidity is above 60, output 'Cloudy', if the temperature is below 25 and the humidity is below 60, output 'Windy'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef weather_forecast(temperature, humidity):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates a weather forecast based on the given temperature and humidity.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature.\n        humidity (float): The current humidity.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return 'Rainy'\n    elif temperature > 25 and humidity <= 60:\n        return 'Sunny'\n    elif temperature <= 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return 'Cloudy'\n    else:\n        return 'Windy'\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature: \"))\n    humidity = float(input(\"Enter the humidity: \"))\n    forecast = weather_forecast(temperature, humidity)\n    print(f\"The weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `weather_forecast` function takes two parameters: `temperature` and `humidity`. It uses conditional statements to determine the weather forecast based on the given conditions.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to input the temperature and humidity, calls the `weather_forecast` function, and prints the resulting forecast.\n*   The program uses a simple and readable structure, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user inputs a temperature of 30 and a humidity of 70, the program will output `Rainy`.\n*   If the user inputs a temperature of 30 and a humidity of 50, the program will output `Sunny`.\n*   If the user inputs a temperature of 20 and a humidity of 70, the program will output `Cloudy`.\n*   If the user inputs a temperature of 20 and a humidity of 50, the program will output `Windy`.",
