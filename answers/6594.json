  "answer": "**Euclidean Algorithm for GCD Calculation**\n==========================================\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a method for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Here is a Python program that implements this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = 48\nnum2 = 18\nprint(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function enters a while loop that continues until `b` becomes 0.\n3. Inside the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are updated using the Euclidean algorithm formula: `a, b = b, a % b`.\n4. Once `b` becomes 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\nFor the input numbers 48 and 18, the output will be:\n```\nThe GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n---------------------------\n\nTo illustrate the calculation, here are the steps for the example input:\n\n1. `a = 48`, `b = 18`\n2. `a, b = 18, 48 % 18 = 12`\n3. `a, b = 12, 18 % 12 = 6`\n4. `a, b = 6, 12 % 6 = 0`\n5. Since `b` is now 0, the GCD is returned as `abs(a) = 6`",
