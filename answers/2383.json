  "prompt": "Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a = 0;\n    int b = 1;\n    int c = 0;\n    int n;\n    cout << \"Enter the value of n: \";\n    cin >> n;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        cout << a << \" \";\n        c = a + b;\n        a = b;\n        b = c;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code does exactly what the specifications describe: it prompts the user for a value of `n`, generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`-th term using a `for` loop, and prints the sequence to the console.",
