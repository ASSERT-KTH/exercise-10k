Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"\nline_length = 50\n\njustified_lines = justify_text(text, line_length)\n\nfor line in justified_lines:\n    print(line)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  **Text Splitting**: The input text is split into words.\n2.  **Line Construction**: Words are added to the current line until it reaches the desired length.\n3.  **Line Justification**: When a line is full, it is justified by adding spaces between words using the `justify_line` function.\n4.  **Last Line Justification**: The last line is justified by adding spaces to the right using the `justify_last_line` function.\n5.  **Result**: The justified lines are returned as a list of strings.\n\n**Note**: This implementation assumes that the input text only contains spaces as word delimiters. If your text uses other delimiters (e.g., tabs), you may need to adjust the `split` method accordingly.",
