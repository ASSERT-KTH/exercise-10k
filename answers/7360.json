  "answer": "Implicit Type Casting in Arithmetic Operations\n==============================================\n\nIn this example, we will perform arithmetic operations on variables with different data types and observe how implicit type casting works.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\n# Define variables with different data types\na = 10  # integer\nb = 3.5  # float\nc = \"5\"  # string\n\n# Perform arithmetic operations\nresult1 = a + b\nresult2 = a + int(c)  # explicit type casting\nresult3 = a + float(c)  # explicit type casting\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Result 1 (a + b):\", result1, type(result1))\nprint(\"Result 2 (a + int(c)):\", result2, type(result2))\nprint(\"Result 3 (a + float(c)):\", result3, type(result3))\n\n# Attempt to perform arithmetic operation with incompatible types\ntry:\n    result4 = a + c\n    print(\"Result 4 (a + c):\", result4)\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(\"Error:\", e)\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nResult 1 (a + b): 13.5 <class 'float'>\nResult 2 (a + int(c)): 15 <class 'int'>\nResult 3 (a + float(c)): 15.0 <class 'float'>\nError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn the above code:\n\n1.  `result1` is calculated by adding an integer `a` and a float `b`. The result is a float because Python implicitly casts the integer to a float to perform the operation.\n2.  `result2` is calculated by adding an integer `a` and the integer value of a string `c`. We use explicit type casting `int(c)` to convert the string to an integer. The result is an integer because both operands are integers.\n3.  `result3` is calculated by adding an integer `a` and the float value of a string `c`. We use explicit type casting `float(c)` to convert the string to a float. The result is a float because one of the operands is a float.\n4.  When we attempt to calculate `result4` by adding an integer `a` and a string `c` without explicit type casting, Python raises a `TypeError` because it cannot perform arithmetic operations on incompatible types.\n\nIn summary, implicit type casting in arithmetic operations occurs when Python automatically converts the data type of one operand to match the other operand, allowing the operation to be performed. However, it's essential to use explicit type casting when working with incompatible types to avoid errors.",
