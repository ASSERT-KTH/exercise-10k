  "prompt": "Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age. The program should then print out a greeting message with the user's name and tell them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    return name, age\n\n\ndef print_greeting_and_future_age(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message and the user's age in 5 years.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    future_age = age + 5\n    print(f\"In 5 years, you will be {future_age} years old.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the program.\"\"\"\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting_and_future_age(name, age)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`get_user_info()` function**: This function is used to get the user's name and age. It uses the built-in `input()` function to get the user's name and age. The user's age is validated to ensure it is a valid integer.\n2. **`print_greeting_and_future_age()` function**: This function takes the user's name and age as arguments and prints a greeting message along with the user's age in 5 years.\n3. **`main()` function**: This is the main function where the program starts execution. It calls the `get_user_info()` function to get the user's information and then calls the `print_greeting_and_future_age()` function to print the greeting message and the user's future age.\n4. **Program Execution**: The program uses the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure the `main()` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John!\nIn 5 years, you will be 35 years old.\n```\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `user_info.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python user_info.py`). Follow the prompts to enter your name and age, and the program will print the greeting message and your age in 5 years.",
