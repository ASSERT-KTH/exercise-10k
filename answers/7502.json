  "prompt": "Understand the precedence of basic operators and evaluate an expression.",
  "answer": "The precedence of basic operators in most programming languages is as follows:\n\n1. Parentheses: Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first.\n2. Exponents: Exponents (such as squaring or cubing) are evaluated next.\n3. Multiplication and Division: These operators are evaluated from left to right.\n4. Addition and Subtraction: These operators are also evaluated from left to right.\n\nThis is often remembered using the mnemonic \"PEMDAS\":\n\n1. P - Parentheses\n2. E - Exponents\n3. M - Multiplication\n4. D - Division\n5. A - Addition\n6. S - Subtraction\n\nLet's evaluate the expression: `3 + 4 * 2 - 1`\n\nUsing the precedence rules:\n\n1. Multiply 4 and 2: `4 * 2 = 8`\n2. Add 3 and 8: `3 + 8 = 11`\n3. Subtract 1 from 11: `11 - 1 = 10`\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `3 + 4 * 2 - 1` is `10`.\n\nHere's another example: `10 / 2 + 3 * 2 - 1`\n\nUsing the precedence rules:\n\n1. Divide 10 by 2: `10 / 2 = 5`\n2. Multiply 3 and 2: `3 * 2 = 6`\n3. Add 5 and 6: `5 + 6 = 11`\n4. Subtract 1 from 11: `11 - 1 = 10`\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `10 / 2 + 3 * 2 - 1` is `10`.\n\nLet's try one more example: `(3 + 2) * 4 - 1`\n\nUsing the precedence rules:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `3 + 2 = 5`\n2. Multiply 5 by 4: `5 * 4 = 20`\n3. Subtract 1 from 20: `20 - 1 = 19`\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(3 + 2) * 4 - 1` is `19`.",
