  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that reads a JSON object from a file and prints out its values. This program uses the `json` library, which is part of the Python standard library.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef print_json_values(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a JSON object from a file and prints out its values.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The path to the JSON file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n            # Load the JSON data from the file\n            data = json.load(file)\n\n            # Print the JSON values\n            print_json_values_recursive(data)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to parse JSON: {e}\")\n\ndef print_json_values_recursive(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively prints the values of a JSON object.\n\n    Args:\n        data (dict or list): The JSON object to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(data, dict):\n        # If the data is a dictionary, print its values\n        for key, value in data.items():\n            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n            # If the value is a dictionary or list, print its values recursively\n            if isinstance(value, (dict, list)):\n                print_json_values_recursive(value)\n\n    elif isinstance(data, list):\n        # If the data is a list, print its values\n        for i, value in enumerate(data):\n            print(f\"[{i}]: {value}\")\n\n            # If the value is a dictionary or list, print its values recursively\n            if isinstance(value, (dict, list)):\n                print_json_values_recursive(value)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    filename = \"example.json\"\n    print_json_values(filename)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   This program uses two functions: `print_json_values` and `print_json_values_recursive`.\n*   The `print_json_values` function reads a JSON object from a file and calls the `print_json_values_recursive` function to print its values.\n*   The `print_json_values_recursive` function recursively prints the values of a JSON object. It handles both dictionaries and lists, and prints the values of nested dictionaries and lists.\n*   The example usage at the end shows how to use the `print_json_values` function to read a JSON object from a file named \"example.json\". Make sure to replace \"example.json\" with the path to your JSON file.\n\n### JSON File Example\n\nHere's an example JSON file that you can use to test the program:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"address\": {\n        \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n        \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n        \"state\": \"CA\",\n        \"zip\": \"12345\"\n    },\n    \"interests\": [\n        \"reading\",\n        \"hiking\",\n        \"coding\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run the program with this JSON file, it will print out the values of the JSON object, including the nested values in the \"address\" dictionary and the \"interests\" list.",
