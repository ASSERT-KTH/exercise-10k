  "answer": "**Array Difference Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements that are in the first array but not in the second array.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef array_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new array containing the elements that are in arr1 but not in arr2.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first input array.\n        arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new array containing the elements that are in arr1 but not in arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in arr1 if element not in arr2]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    result = array_difference(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Result:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `array_difference` function takes two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new array containing the elements that are in `arr1` but not in `arr2`.\n3. The `not in` operator is used to check if an element is not present in `arr2`.\n4. The resulting array is returned by the function.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `array_difference` function with two example arrays.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nNote that this program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the `not in` operator. For large input arrays, a more efficient approach using sets or dictionaries may be necessary.",
