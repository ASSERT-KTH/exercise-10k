  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds the index of the last occurrence of an element in a list. This function will return the index of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the element is not found. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef last_occurrence(lst, elem):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of an element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        elem: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the last occurrence of the element. Returns -1 if the element is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reverse the list to start searching from the end\n    reversed_lst = lst[::-1]\n    \n    # Try to find the index of the element in the reversed list\n    try:\n        # The index method returns the index of the first occurrence of the element\n        # Since we're searching in a reversed list, this will give us the index of the last occurrence in the original list\n        idx = reversed_lst.index(elem)\n        \n        # Since we're working with a reversed list, we need to subtract the index from the length of the list minus one\n        # This will give us the correct index in the original list\n        idx = len(lst) - 1 - idx\n        \n        # Return the index\n        return idx\n    \n    # If the element is not found, the index method will raise a ValueError\n    except ValueError:\n        # In this case, we return -1 as specified in the problem\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `last_occurrence` takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to search in) and `elem` (the element to search for). It returns the index of the last occurrence of `elem` in `lst`.\n* To find the last occurrence efficiently, the function reverses the input list `lst` using slicing (`lst[::-1]`) and assigns it to `reversed_lst`. It then attempts to find the index of `elem` in `reversed_lst` using the `index` method.\n* If `elem` is found in `reversed_lst`, its index is calculated as `len(lst) - 1 - idx`, where `idx` is the index in the reversed list. This adjustment is necessary because the original list is reversed, so the index needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n* If `elem` is not found in the list, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns -1 to indicate that the element was not found.",
