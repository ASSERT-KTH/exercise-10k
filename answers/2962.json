  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that fulfills your requirements. It uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 100, and then repeatedly asks the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess, and the program will tell you if it's higher or lower than the actual number.\n4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n5. If you want to quit, type \"quit\" at any time.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or type \"quit\" to exit the game.",
