  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two names as input and calculates a love percentage based on the following conditions: the love percentage is calculated by counting the number of matching letters in the two names and dividing it by the total number of letters in the two names.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications:\n\n```python\n# Taking input\nname1 = input(\"Enter the first name: \")\nname2 = input(\"Enter the second name: \")\n\n# Converting to lowercase\nname1 = name1.lower()\nname2 = name2.lower()\n\n# Removing spaces\nname1 = name1.replace(\" \", \"\")\nname2 = name2.replace(\" \", \"\")\n\n# Calculating total number of letters\ntotal_letters = len(name1) + len(name2)\n\n# Creating a copy of name1\nname1_copy = name1\n\n# Counting matching letters\nlove_percent = 0\nfor char in name2:\n    if char in name1_copy:\n        love_percent += 1\n        name1_copy = name1_copy.replace(char, \"\", 1)\n\n# Calculating love percentage\nlove_percent = (love_percent / total_letters) * 100\n\n# Printing result\nprint(\"Love percentage: \", love_percent)\n```\n\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification to calculate the love percentage between two names. It takes input, preprocesses the names, counts matching letters, calculates the love percentage, and prints the result.",
