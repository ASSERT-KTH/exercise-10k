  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The system should take the account balance and the transaction amount as inputs. If the transaction amount is greater than the account balance, the system should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the system should subtract the transaction amount from the account balance and print the new balance.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the bank transaction system as per the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef bank_transaction_system(account_balance, transaction_amount):\n    if transaction_amount > account_balance:\n        print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n    else:\n        account_balance -= transaction_amount\n        print(\"Your new balance is: \", account_balance)\n\n# Example usage\naccount_balance = 1000\ntransaction_amount = 500\nbank_transaction_system(account_balance, transaction_amount)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `bank_transaction_system` function that takes `account_balance` and `transaction_amount` as inputs, performs the necessary operations, and prints the result. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with specific values for `account_balance` and `transaction_amount`.",
