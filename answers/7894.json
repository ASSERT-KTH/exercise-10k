  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on a given operator. The program should output the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications you provided:\n```\n# Define the arithmetic operations as functions\ndef addition(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtraction(num1, num2):\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiplication(num1, num2):\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef division(num1, num2):\n    if num2 == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n    return num1 / num2\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Check the operator and perform the corresponding operation\n    if operator == \"+\":\n        result = addition(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == \"-\":\n        result = subtraction(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == \"*\":\n        result = multiplication(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == \"/\":\n        result = division(num1, num2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operator. Please enter +, -, *, or /.\")\n        return\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic operations as functions, defines the `main` function to get user input and perform the operation, and uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input. It also checks for division by zero and handles invalid operators. Finally, it prints the result of the operation to the console.",
