  "prompt": "Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a given character in a string with another character and prints out the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef replace_char(string, char_to_replace, new_char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replaces all occurrences of a given character in a string with another character.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char_to_replace (str): The character to be replaced.\n        new_char (str): The new character.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all occurrences of char_to_replace replaced by new_char.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.replace(char_to_replace, new_char)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char_to_replace = input(\"Enter the character to replace: \")\n    new_char = input(\"Enter the new character: \")\n\n    result = replace_char(string, char_to_replace, new_char)\n    print(\"Result: \", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses Python's built-in string method `replace()` to replace all occurrences of a given character with another character. The `main()` function asks the user for input and then calls the `replace_char()` function to perform the replacement.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The `replace_char()` function takes three arguments: `string`, `char_to_replace`, and `new_char`.\n2. It uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of `char_to_replace` with `new_char` in the `string`.\n3. The result is returned by the function.\n4. In the `main()` function, the user is asked to input a string, the character to replace, and the new character.\n5. The `replace_char()` function is called with these inputs, and the result is printed out.\n\nYou can run this program and test it with different inputs to see how it works.",
