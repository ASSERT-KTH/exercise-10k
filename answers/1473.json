  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three integer inputs from the user, finds the minimum and maximum values, and prints the results.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport sys\n\n# Read input from user\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\n# Find minimum and maximum values\nmin_val = min(a, b, c)\nmax_val = max(a, b, c)\n\n# Print results\nprint(min_val)\nprint(max_val)\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, using the `input()` function to read input from the user, the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values, and `print()` to output the results.",
