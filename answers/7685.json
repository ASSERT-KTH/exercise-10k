  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, checks if the list is empty, and returns the average of the numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average of the numbers by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a list of numbers and print the result.",
