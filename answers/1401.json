  "prompt": "Write a program that greets the user based on the time of day. If the time is between 6am and 12pm, print 'Good morning', between 12pm and 5pm print 'Good afternoon', otherwise print 'Good evening'. Assume the user inputs the time in 24-hour format.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n```python\ndef greet_user(time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Greets the user based on the time of day.\n\n    Args:\n        time (int): Time in 24-hour format.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Greeting message.\n    \"\"\"\n    if 6 <= time <= 12:  # 6am to 12pm\n        return 'Good morning'\n    elif 12 < time <= 17:  # 12pm to 5pm\n        return 'Good afternoon'\n    else:  # Otherwise\n        return 'Good evening'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time in 24-hour format (HH): \"))\n\n    # Validate user input\n    if not 0 <= time <= 23:\n        print(\"Invalid time. Please enter a time between 0 and 23.\")\n    else:\n        # Print greeting message\n        print(greet_user(time))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `greet_user` function takes an integer `time` as input and returns a greeting message based on the time of day.\n2. The `main` function gets user input, validates it to ensure it's within the range 0-23, and then calls `greet_user` to print the greeting message.\n3. The program uses a simple `if-elif-else` statement to determine the greeting message based on the time of day.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Input: `8` (8am) -> Output: `Good morning`\n* Input: `14` (2pm) -> Output: `Good afternoon`\n* Input: `20` (8pm) -> Output: `Good evening`",
