  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements. This program uses a dictionary to store pre-defined responses to basic user input and a list to remember the conversation history.\n\n```python\n# conversation_bot.py\n\nclass ConversationBot:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.responses = {\n            \"hello\": \"Hi! How can I assist you today?\",\n            \"goodbye\": \"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\",\n            \"how are you\": \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking!\",\n            \"what is your name\": \"My name is Conversation Bot.\",\n            \"default\": \"I didn't quite understand that. Please try again.\"\n        }\n        self.conversation_history = []\n\n    def get_response(self, user_input):\n        user_input = user_input.lower()\n        for key in self.responses:\n            if key in user_input:\n                return self.responses[key]\n        return self.responses[\"default\"]\n\n    def remember_conversation(self, user_input, response):\n        self.conversation_history.append(f\"User: {user_input}\")\n        self.conversation_history.append(f\"Bot: {response}\")\n\n    def display_conversation_history(self):\n        print(\"\\nConversation History:\")\n        for line in self.conversation_history:\n            print(line)\n\n\ndef main():\n    bot = ConversationBot()\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"User: \")\n        response = bot.get_response(user_input)\n        print(f\"Bot: {response}\")\n        bot.remember_conversation(user_input, response)\n        if user_input.lower() == \"goodbye\":\n            bot.display_conversation_history()\n            break\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run\n\nTo run this program, save the above code in a file named `conversation_bot.py`. Then, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython conversation_bot.py\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nHere's an example conversation with the bot:\n\n```\nUser: hello\nBot: Hi! How can I assist you today?\nUser: how are you\nBot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!\nUser: what is your name\nBot: My name is Conversation Bot.\nUser: goodbye\nBot: Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hello\nBot: Hi! How can I assist you today?\nUser: how are you\nBot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!\nUser: what is your name\nBot: My name is Conversation Bot.\nUser: goodbye\nBot: Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\n```\n\nThis program creates a simple text-based conversation bot that responds to basic user input with pre-defined responses and remembers the conversation history. The bot continues to chat with the user until the user types \"goodbye\", at which point it displays the conversation history and exits.",
