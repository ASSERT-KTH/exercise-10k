  "prompt": "Create a program that reads input from the user and prints out a greeting message, then print out the greeting.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that reads input from the user and prints out a greeting message:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting():\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting message to the user.\"\"\"\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    greeting_message = f\"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to our program.\"\n    print(greeting_message)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to execute the program.\"\"\"\n    print_greeting()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run this program, simply copy the code into a Python file, save it, and run it. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name, it will print out a greeting message.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `print_greeting` function is defined to read input from the user and print out a greeting message.\n2. Inside the `print_greeting` function, the `input` function is used to read the user's name.\n3. A greeting message is created using an f-string, which allows us to insert the user's name into the message.\n4. The `print` function is used to print out the greeting message.\n5. The `main` function is defined to execute the `print_greeting` function.\n6. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module).",
