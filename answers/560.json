  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef length_of_longest_substring(s):\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    seen = set()\n    \n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in seen:\n            seen.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        seen.add(s[right])\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n    \n    return max_length\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"abcabcbb\"\nresult = length_of_longest_substring(s)\nprint(result)  # Output: 3\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, using a sliding window approach to find the longest substring without repeating characters in the input string `s`. The `seen` set is used to keep track of the characters in the current substring, and the `left` and `right` pointers are used to slide the window over the string. The `max_length` variable keeps track of the maximum length of a substring without repeating characters found so far.",
