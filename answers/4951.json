  "prompt": "Write a program that checks whether a person is an adult or a minor based on their age using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks whether a person is an adult or a minor based on their age using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef check_adult_or_minor(age):\n    if age >= 18:\n        return \"Adult\"\n    else:\n        return \"Minor\"\n\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\nresult = check_adult_or_minor(age)\nprint(f\"You are a {result}.\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Enter your age: 25\n# You are a Adult.\n\n# Enter your age: 17\n# You are a Minor.\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `check_adult_or_minor()` that takes the person's age as input. The function uses an if-else statement to check whether the age is greater than or equal to 18. If the age is 18 or above, the function returns \"Adult\". Otherwise, it returns \"Minor\". The program then asks the user to enter their age, calls the function with the entered age, and prints the result.",
