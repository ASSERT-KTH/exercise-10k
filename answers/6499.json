  "answer": "**Hangman Game Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of hangman with the user. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and then allows the user to guess letters.

The program will print out the updated word with correctly guessed letters filled in after each guess. If you guess a letter correctly, it will fill in the corresponding blanks. If you guess incorrectly, it will draw a part of the hangman's gallows. The game continues until you guess the word or the gallows is complete and the hangman is \"hanged.\"",
