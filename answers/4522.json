  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a slice of the list from the start index to the end index.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef list_slice(input_list, start, end):\n    return input_list[start:end]\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(list_slice(my_list, 1, 4))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n```\nThis code defines a function `list_slice` that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a slice of the list from the start index to the end index. The function is then called with a sample list and indices, and the result is printed to the console.",
