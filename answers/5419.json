  "answer": "**Perfect Square Check Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16, etc.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers_to_check = [4, 9, 16, 20, 25]\n    for num in numbers_to_check:\n        result = is_perfect_square(num)\n        print(f\"Is {num} a perfect square? {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the given number. If the square root is an integer (i.e., it has no decimal part), then the number is a perfect square.\n\n1. We first check if the number is negative. Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares, so we return False immediately.\n2. We calculate the square root of the number using `math.sqrt`.\n3. We check if the square root is equal to its integer part (i.e., `sqrt == int(sqrt)`). If it is, then the number is a perfect square, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking if a number is a perfect square in a mathematical context.\n* Validating user input to ensure it is a perfect square.\n* Using the function in a larger program to perform calculations involving perfect squares.",
