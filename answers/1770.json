  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character Function**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function finds the first non-repeating character in a given string. It does this by creating a dictionary to store the frequency of each character, then iterating over the string to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_freq = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Find the first character with a frequency of 1\n    for char in s:\n        if char_freq[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbc\"))  # Output: c\n    print(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create a dictionary `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string to populate the `char_freq` dictionary.\n3. Iterate over the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n4. If such a character is found, return it. Otherwise, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over the string twice: once to populate the `char_freq` dictionary, and once to find the first non-repeating character.",
