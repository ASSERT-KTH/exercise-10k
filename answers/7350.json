  "answer": "**Bitwise AND Operation**\n\n### Description\n\nThe bitwise AND operation compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef bitwise_and(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a bitwise AND operation on two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The result of the bitwise AND operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a & b\n\n# Example usage:\na = 5   # Binary: 101\nb = 3   # Binary: 011\n\nresult = bitwise_and(a, b)\nprint(f\"The result of {a} AND {b} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `bitwise_and` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. It uses the `&` operator to perform the bitwise AND operation.\n3. The result is returned by the function.\n4. In the example usage, we perform a bitwise AND operation on the integers 5 and 3.\n5. The binary representation of 5 is `101`, and the binary representation of 3 is `011`.\n6. The bitwise AND operation compares each bit:\n   * `1` (from 5) AND `0` (from 3) = `0`\n   * `0` (from 5) AND `1` (from 3) = `0`\n   * `1` (from 5) AND `1` (from 3) = `1`\n7. The result is `001`, which is the binary representation of the integer 1.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n\n```\nThe result of 5 AND 3 is: 1\n```",
