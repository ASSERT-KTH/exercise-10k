Please ensure it meets the following criteria:\")\n        print(\"  - At least 8 characters long\")\n        print(\"  - Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n        print(\"  - Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n        print(\"  - Contains at least one digit\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. The `check_password` function takes a password as input and checks its length. If the password is less than 8 characters long, it immediately returns `False`.\n2. The function then uses regular expressions to check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If any of these checks fail, it returns `False`.\n3. If the password passes all checks, the function returns `True`.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a password. The `check_password` function is then called with this password, and the result is printed out. If the password is not valid, the user is given feedback on what criteria the password failed to meet.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Valid password: `Password123`\n* Invalid password (less than 8 characters): `Pass1`\n* Invalid password (no uppercase letter): `password123`\n* Invalid password (no lowercase letter): `PASSWORD123`\n* Invalid password (no digit): `Password`",
