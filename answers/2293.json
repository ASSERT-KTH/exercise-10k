  "answer": "**Movie Ticket Price Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total price of movie tickets based on the number of adult and child tickets purchased. The prices for adult and child tickets are assumed to be $10 and $5, respectively.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_ticket_price(adult_tickets, child_tickets):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total price of movie tickets.\n\n    Args:\n        adult_tickets (int): Number of adult tickets purchased.\n        child_tickets (int): Number of child tickets purchased.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total price of movie tickets.\n    \"\"\"\n    adult_price = 10.0\n    child_price = 5.0\n\n    total_price = (adult_tickets * adult_price) + (child_tickets * child_price)\n\n    return total_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Movie Ticket Price Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    adult_tickets = int(input(\"Enter the number of adult tickets: \"))\n    child_tickets = int(input(\"Enter the number of child tickets: \"))\n\n    total_price = calculate_ticket_price(adult_tickets, child_tickets)\n\n    print(f\"Total price: ${total_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_ticket_price` function takes the number of adult and child tickets as input and returns the total price.\n2. The prices for adult and child tickets are defined as constants within the function.\n3. The total price is calculated by multiplying the number of adult and child tickets by their respective prices and summing the results.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the number of adult and child tickets, calls the `calculate_ticket_price` function, and prints the total price.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nMovie Ticket Price Calculator\n--------------------------------\nEnter the number of adult tickets: 2\nEnter the number of child tickets: 1\nTotal price: $25.00\n```\n\nThis program can be run from the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python. Simply save the code to a file (e.g., `movie_tickets.py`) and run it using `python movie_tickets.py`.",
