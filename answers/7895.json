  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a loop. The pattern should start with 1 and each subsequent row should have one more number than the previous row. The numbers in each row should be separated by a space. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be: 1, 2 1, 3 2 1, 4 3 2 1, 5 4 3 2 1",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(n):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n            print(j, end=' ')\n        print()\n\n# Test the function\nprint_pattern(5)\n```\n\nThis program uses two nested loops to print the pattern. The outer loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` iterates over each row, and the inner loop `for j in range(i, 0, -1):` prints the numbers in each row in descending order. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function is used to separate the numbers with spaces instead of newlines. The `print()` function without any arguments is used to print a newline after each row.\n\nWhen you run this program with the input `5`, it will print the following pattern:\n```\n1 \n2 1 \n3 2 1 \n4 3 2 1 \n5 4 3 2 1 \n```",
