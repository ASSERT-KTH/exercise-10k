  "answer": "**Calculating the Cost of an Item with Tax and Discount**\n===========================================================\n\nIn this scenario, we'll create a function to calculate the cost of an item after applying tax and discount. We'll use this function to calculate the final cost of an item.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_item_cost(base_price, tax_rate, discount_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cost of an item after applying tax and discount.\n\n    Args:\n        base_price (float): The base price of the item.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08).\n        discount_rate (float): The discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 10% = 0.10).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final cost of the item.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the tax amount\n    tax_amount = base_price * tax_rate\n    \n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = base_price * discount_rate\n    \n    # Calculate the final cost\n    final_cost = base_price + tax_amount - discount_amount\n    \n    return final_cost\n\n# Example usage\nbase_price = 100.0  # Base price of the item\ntax_rate = 0.08  # 8% tax rate\ndiscount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount rate\n\nfinal_cost = calculate_item_cost(base_price, tax_rate, discount_rate)\nprint(f\"Final cost: ${final_cost:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_item_cost` function takes three arguments:\n\t* `base_price`: The base price of the item.\n\t* `tax_rate`: The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 8% = 0.08).\n\t* `discount_rate`: The discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 10% = 0.10).\n2. The function calculates the tax amount by multiplying the base price by the tax rate.\n3. The function calculates the discount amount by multiplying the base price by the discount rate.\n4. The function calculates the final cost by adding the tax amount to the base price and subtracting the discount amount.\n5. The function returns the final cost.\n6. In the example usage, we call the `calculate_item_cost` function with a base price of $100.00, an 8% tax rate, and a 10% discount rate.\n7. The function calculates the final cost and prints it to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nFinal cost: $98.00\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a real-world scenario where you need to calculate the cost of an item after applying tax and discount. The `calculate_item_cost` function makes it easy to perform this calculation with different base prices, tax rates, and discount rates.",
