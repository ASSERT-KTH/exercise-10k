  "answer": "### Searching a Dictionary for a Key or Value\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that will search a dictionary for a given key or value.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef search_dict(dictionary, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches a dictionary for a given key or value.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search.\n        target (any): The key or value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples containing the key and value if the target is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    found = []\n    for key, value in dictionary.items():\n        if key == target or value == target:\n            found.append((key, value))\n    return found\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\n        \"apple\": 1,\n        \"banana\": 2,\n        \"cherry\": 3\n    }\n    print(search_dict(example_dict, \"apple\"))  # Search for key\n    print(search_dict(example_dict, 2))  # Search for value\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function iterates through each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the target matches either the key or the value, it adds the key-value pair to the `found` list. The function returns the `found` list.\n\nNote that this function will return all key-value pairs that match the target, not just the first one. This is because dictionaries can have multiple keys with the same value, and vice versa.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function has to iterate through every key-value pair in the dictionary.",
