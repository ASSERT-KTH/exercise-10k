  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates Pascal's triangle up to the nth row:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate Pascal's triangle up to the nth row.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of rows to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the triangle with the first row\n    triangle = [[1]]\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining rows\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Initialize the current row with the first element (1)\n        row = [1]\n\n        # Calculate the middle elements of the current row\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            # The jth element in the current row is the sum of the (j-1)th and jth elements in the previous row\n            row.append(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j])\n\n        # Append the last element (1) to the current row\n        row.append(1)\n\n        # Append the current row to the triangle\n        triangle.append(row)\n\n    return triangle\n\n\ndef print_pascals_triangle(triangle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print Pascal's triangle in a readable format.\n\n    Args:\n    triangle (list): A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the rows in the triangle\n    for i, row in enumerate(triangle):\n        # Print leading spaces to center the triangle\n        print(' ' * (len(triangle) - i - 1), end='')\n\n        # Print the elements in the current row\n        for num in row:\n            print(f'{num} ', end='')\n\n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of rows from the user\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n\n    # Generate Pascal's triangle\n    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\n\n    # Print Pascal's triangle\n    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter the number of rows you want to generate. For example, if you enter `5`, the program will output the following Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n    1 \n   1 1 \n  1 2 1 \n 1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n```",
