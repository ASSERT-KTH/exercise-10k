  "prompt": "Write a program that performs basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) using variables.",
  "answer": "Based on the specifications you provided, here is the code that meets all the requirements:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x = 5;\n    int y = 3;\n\n    printf(\"x = %d\\n\", x);\n    printf(\"y = %d\\n\", y);\n\n    printf(\"x & y = %d\\n\", x & y);\n    printf(\"x | y = %d\\n\", x | y);\n    printf(\"x ^ y = %d\\n\", x ^ y);\n    printf(\"~x = %d\\n\", ~x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `stdio.h` library, defines the `main` function, declares and initializes the `x` and `y` variables, prints their values, performs the bitwise operations, prints the results, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
