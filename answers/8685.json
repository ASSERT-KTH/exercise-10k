  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score:\n\n```python\n# Define the questions, options, and answers\nquestions = [\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Rome\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Paris\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Earth\", \"Saturn\", \"Jupiter\", \"Uranus\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Jupiter\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Raphael\", \"Caravaggio\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\"\n    }\n]\n\ndef quiz(questions):\n    score = 0\n    for i, question in enumerate(questions, start=1):\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion {i}: {question['question']}\")\n        for j, option in enumerate(question['options'], start=1):\n            print(f\"{j}. {option}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter the number of your answer: \")\n        if question['options'][int(answer) - 1] == question['answer']:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {question['answer']}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    quiz(questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1.  The program defines a list of questions, each represented as a dictionary containing the question text, a list of options, and the correct answer.\n2.  The `quiz` function takes the list of questions as input and initializes a score variable to 0.\n3.  It then iterates over each question in the list, printing the question text and options.\n4.  The user is prompted to enter the number of their answer, and the program checks whether the selected option matches the correct answer.\n5.  If the answer is correct, the user's score is incremented, and a success message is displayed. Otherwise, a failure message with the correct answer is shown.\n6.  After all questions have been asked, the program displays the user's final score.\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the Python script, and follow the prompts to complete the quiz.",
