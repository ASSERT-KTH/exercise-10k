  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a single value representing the reduction of the list according to a specified operation (e.g. sum, product, etc.).",
  "answer": "Based on the specifications you provided, I've written the code in Python:\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input from user\n    lista = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\n    # Define operations\n    sum_list = lambda x, y: x + y\n    prod_list = lambda x, y: x * y\n    max_list = lambda x, y: max(x, y)\n    min_list = lambda x, y: min(x, y)\n\n    # Apply operations using reduce function\n    sum_result = reduce(sum_list, lista)\n    prod_result = reduce(prod_list, lista)\n    max_result = reduce(max_list, lista)\n    min_result = reduce(min_list, lista)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(\"Sum:\", sum_result)\n    print(\"Product:\", prod_result)\n    print(\"Max:\", max_result)\n    print(\"Min:\", min_result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've used the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to apply the operations to the list, as specified in the requirements. I've also used lambda functions to define the operations, which is a common way to define small, short functions in Python.",
