  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a dictionary and a value, and returns the key associated with that value if it exists, otherwise returns 'Value not found'.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that retrieves the key associated with a given value from a dictionary. This function will return the key if the value exists in the dictionary; otherwise, it will return a message indicating that the value was not found. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_key(dictionary, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the key associated with a given value in a dictionary.\n    \n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        value: The value to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n        The key associated with the value if it exists, otherwise 'Value not found'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # First, we'll iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary\n    for key, val in dictionary.items():\n        \n        # For each pair, we'll check if the value matches the one we're looking for\n        if val == value:\n            \n            # If we find a match, we'll return the corresponding key\n            return key\n    \n    # If we've iterated over the entire dictionary and haven't found a match, we'll return 'Value not found'\n    return 'Value not found'\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nprint(find_key(my_dict, 2))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_key(my_dict, 4))  # Output: 'Value not found'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_key` takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `value`. It iterates over each key-value pair in the `dictionary` using the `.items()` method.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if the current value `val` matches the target `value`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the corresponding `key`.\n* If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns the message 'Value not found'.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `find_key` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict` and different values to retrieve the associated keys or the 'Value not found' message.",
