  "answer": "### Amicable Numbers Sum Function\n#### Overview\nAmicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. A proper divisor is a positive divisor of a number excluding the number itself.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_proper_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    divisors_sum = 1  # 1 is a divisor of every number\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors_sum += i\n            if i != n // i:  # Check if divisors are different\n                divisors_sum += n // i\n    return divisors_sum\n\ndef sum_of_amicable_numbers(limit):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of amicable numbers less than a given limit.\"\"\"\n    amicable_numbers = set()\n    for i in range(1, limit):\n        sum_of_divisors_i = sum_of_proper_divisors(i)\n        if sum_of_divisors_i < limit:\n            sum_of_divisors_j = sum_of_proper_divisors(sum_of_divisors_i)\n            if sum_of_divisors_j == i and i != sum_of_divisors_i:\n                amicable_numbers.add(i)\n                amicable_numbers.add(sum_of_divisors_i)\n    return sum(amicable_numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 10000\nresult = sum_of_amicable_numbers(limit)\nprint(f\"The sum of amicable numbers less than {limit} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `sum_of_proper_divisors` function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`.\n2. The `sum_of_amicable_numbers` function iterates over all numbers less than the given limit and checks if they are amicable.\n3. If a number `i` is amicable with another number `j`, both `i` and `j` are added to the set of amicable numbers.\n4. Finally, the function returns the sum of all amicable numbers.\n\nNote: This code has a time complexity of O(n*sqrt(n)) due to the calculation of proper divisors for each number. For large limits, a more efficient algorithm may be necessary.",
