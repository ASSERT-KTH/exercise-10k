  "answer": "Here is a Python program that converts a dictionary with city names as keys and their populations as values to a list of tuples and prints the list.\n\n```python\ndef dict_to_list_of_tuples(city_populations: dict) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a dictionary with city names as keys and their populations as values to a list of tuples.\n\n    Args:\n        city_populations (dict): A dictionary with city names as keys and their populations as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a city name and its population.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the items() method to get a view object that displays a list of a dictionary\u2019s key-value tuple pairs\n    list_of_tuples = list(city_populations.items())\n    \n    return list_of_tuples\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example dictionary with city names as keys and their populations as values\n    city_populations = {\n        \"New York\": 8405837,\n        \"Los Angeles\": 3990456,\n        \"Chicago\": 2698459,\n        \"Houston\": 2311793,\n        \"Phoenix\": 1609474\n    }\n\n    # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples\n    list_of_tuples = dict_to_list_of_tuples(city_populations)\n\n    # Print the list of tuples\n    print(\"List of tuples:\")\n    for i, (city, population) in enumerate(list_of_tuples):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {city}: {population}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `dict_to_list_of_tuples()` that takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of tuples. We use the `items()` method of the dictionary to get a view object that displays a list of a dictionary\u2019s key-value tuple pairs, and then convert this view object to a list.\n\nIn the `main()` function, we create an example dictionary `city_populations` with city names as keys and their populations as values. We then call the `dict_to_list_of_tuples()` function to convert this dictionary to a list of tuples, and print the list of tuples.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nList of tuples:\n1. New York: 8405837\n2. Los Angeles: 3990456\n3. Chicago: 2698459\n4. Houston: 2311793\n5. Phoenix: 1609474\n```",
