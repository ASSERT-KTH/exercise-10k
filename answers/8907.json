  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any white spaces and convert to lower case\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort both strings and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It first removes any white spaces and converts both strings to lower case to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It then checks if both strings have the same length. If they don't, it immediately returns `False`.\n4. If the lengths are the same, it sorts both strings and compares them. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the strings are anagrams.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `are_anagrams` function with two example pairs of strings.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the strings. However, this is a simple and effective solution for checking anagrams. For very large strings, a more efficient solution using a hash table or a counter could be implemented, with a time complexity of O(n).",
