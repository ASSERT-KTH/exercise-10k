  "prompt": "Write a program that declares a variable 'x' inside a function and assigns it the value 10. Then, try to access the variable outside the function. Print the result to the console.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that demonstrates the concept:\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    x = 10  # declare and assign variable 'x' inside the function\n\ndef main():\n    my_function()  # call the function to declare 'x'\n    \n    try:\n        print(x)  # try to access 'x' outside the function\n    except NameError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # print the error message\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function `my_function()` where we declare and assign a variable `x` with the value `10`.\n*   In the `main()` function, we call `my_function()` to execute it, which declares the variable `x`.\n*   We then attempt to print the value of `x` outside `my_function()`.\n*   Since `x` is a local variable within `my_function()` and not accessible outside its scope, Python raises a `NameError`.\n*   We catch this exception using a `try-except` block and print the error message instead.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nError: name 'x' is not defined\n```\n\n**Note:** Variables declared inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed directly outside of it. If you need to access the variable outside the function, consider returning its value from the function or using a global variable (although the use of global variables is generally discouraged).",
