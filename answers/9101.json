  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and then outputs the result. The program should also handle cases where the input is not a string, and provide a meaningful error message.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, here is the code that meets the requirements:\n```\ndef reverse(s):\n    if not isinstance(s, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n    return s[::-1]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(reverse(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\nprint(reverse(\"Python is fun!\"))  # Output: !nuf si nohtyP\n```\nThis code defines the `reverse` function, which takes a string `s` as input, checks if it's a string using `isinstance`, and returns the reversed string using slicing. The test block at the end demonstrates the function's usage with two example strings. If a non-string input is passed to the function, it will raise a `TypeError` with a meaningful error message.",
