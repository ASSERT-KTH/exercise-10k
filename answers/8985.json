  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all consonants removed.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that removes all consonants from a given string input. This function will take a string as input, filter out the consonants, and return the resulting string. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_consonants(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the string with all consonants removed.\n\n    Parameters:\n    input_string (str): The input string to be processed.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The input string with all consonants removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we define the vowels in both lower and upper case\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n\n    # Then, we initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n\n    # We iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # For each character, we check if it is a vowel\n        if char in vowels:\n            # If it is a vowel, we add it to the result string\n            result += char\n\n    # Finally, we return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_consonants` starts by defining the set of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) in the `vowels` variable. This set is used to determine whether a character in the input string should be included in the output.\n* It then iterates over each character `char` in the input string `input_string`, checking if the character is present in the `vowels` set.\n* If `char` is a vowel (i.e., it is found in `vowels`), it is appended to the `result` string, effectively filtering out consonants from the input string.\n* Finally, after processing all characters in the input string, the function returns the `result` string, which contains the input string with all consonants removed.",
