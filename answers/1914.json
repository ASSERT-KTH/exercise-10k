  "answer": "**GPA Calculator**\n=======================\n\nTo calculate the GPA, we will use the following formula:\n\nGPA = (Total Grade Points) / (Total Credits)\n\nWhere Total Grade Points is the sum of the product of each grade's grade point and credit.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n-----------------------\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the GPA given a list of grades and their respective credits:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GPA given a list of grades and their respective credits.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a grade and its credit.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated GPA.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a dictionary to map grades to grade points\n    grade_points = {\n        'A': 4.0,\n        'A-': 3.7,\n        'B+': 3.3,\n        'B': 3.0,\n        'B-': 2.7,\n        'C+': 2.3,\n        'C': 2.0,\n        'C-': 1.7,\n        'D+': 1.3,\n        'D': 1.0,\n        'D-': 0.7,\n        'F': 0.0\n    }\n\n    # Initialize variables to store total grade points and total credits\n    total_grade_points = 0\n    total_credits = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each grade and credit\n    for grade, credit in grades:\n        # Convert grade to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        grade = grade.upper()\n\n        # Check if grade is valid\n        if grade not in grade_points:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid grade: {grade}\")\n\n        # Add grade points and credits to total\n        total_grade_points += grade_points[grade] * credit\n        total_credits += credit\n\n    # Check if there are any credits\n    if total_credits == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"No credits provided\")\n\n    # Calculate GPA\n    gpa = total_grade_points / total_credits\n\n    return gpa\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = [\n    ('A', 3),\n    ('B', 4),\n    ('C', 3),\n    ('A-', 2)\n]\n\ngpa = calculate_gpa(grades)\nprint(f\"GPA: {gpa:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n------------------\n\n1. Define a dictionary to map grades to grade points.\n2. Initialize variables to store total grade points and total credits.\n3. Iterate over each grade and credit in the input list.\n4. Convert each grade to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n5. Check if each grade is valid. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n6. Add grade points and credits to total.\n7. Check if there are any credits. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n8. Calculate GPA by dividing total grade points by total credits.\n9. Return the calculated GPA.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* Calculate GPA for a student with grades `A`, `B`, `C`, and `A-` with respective credits 3, 4, 3, and 2.\n* Calculate GPA for a student with grades `F`, `D`, `C-`, and `B+` with respective credits 2, 3, 4, and 3.",
