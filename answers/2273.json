  "answer": "**Investment Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the interest earned on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the interest earned on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period of the investment in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The interest earned on the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Investment Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    interest = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n\n    print(f\"\\nInterest earned: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Calculate the interest earned on a $10,000 investment with a 5% annual interest rate for 3 years.\n\t* Input: `principal = 10000`, `rate = 5`, `time = 3`\n\t* Output: `Interest earned: $1500.00`, `Total amount: $11500.00`\n2. Calculate the interest earned on a $5000 investment with a 2% annual interest rate for 5 years.\n\t* Input: `principal = 5000`, `rate = 2`, `time = 5`\n\t* Output: `Interest earned: $500.00`, `Total amount: $5500.00`\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `investment_calculator.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python: `python investment_calculator.py`.\n3. Follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n4. The program will calculate and display the interest earned and total amount.",
