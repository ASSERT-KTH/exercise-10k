The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the total count. The `calculate_median` function calculates the median by first sorting the list and then finding the middle element(s). The `calculate_mode` function calculates the mode by counting the frequency of each number and finding the number(s) with the highest frequency. The `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions with a sample list of numbers.",
