  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns a new function with its own scope, addressing your request for a comprehensive solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining a function that will return another function.\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns a new function with its own scope.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A new function with its own scope.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We define a variable inside the outer function to demonstrate it's not accessible from the outer scope.\n    outer_variable = \"I'm in the outer function's scope\"\n    \n    # Now, we define the inner function that will be returned by the outer function.\n    def inner_function():\n        # We define a variable inside the inner function to demonstrate it has its own scope.\n        inner_variable = \"I'm in the inner function's scope\"\n        \n        # We print the inner variable to show it's accessible within the inner function's scope.\n        print(inner_variable)\n        \n        # We try to print the outer variable to show it's accessible from the inner function's scope.\n        print(outer_variable)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the inner function.\n    return inner_function\n\n# We call the outer function to get the inner function.\nnew_function = outer_function()\n\n# We call the new function to execute its code.\nnew_function()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `outer_function` defines a variable `outer_variable` to demonstrate that it's not accessible from the outer scope but is accessible within its own scope and the scope of the `inner_function`.\n* The `inner_function` is defined inside `outer_function` and has its own scope, demonstrated by the `inner_variable`. This variable is only accessible within `inner_function`.\n* When `outer_function` returns `inner_function`, the returned function still has access to the variables in `outer_function`'s scope, such as `outer_variable`, due to a concept known as a closure.\n* The code demonstrates this by printing both `inner_variable` and `outer_variable` from within `inner_function`, showing that `inner_function` can access both its own scope and the scope of `outer_function`.",
