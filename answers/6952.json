  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting based on the input provided. This function will take a name as an argument and print out a greeting message. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a name as an argument and prints a personalized greeting.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name to be used in the greeting.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n\n    # Now, we create the greeting message. We use an f-string to insert the name into the message.\n    # This is a more modern and readable way of formatting strings in Python.\n    greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Finally, we print the greeting message.\n    print(greeting)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_greeting(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_greeting` starts by validating the input `name` to ensure it's a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a message indicating that the input must be a string.\n* It then constructs a personalized greeting message using an f-string, which allows for embedding the `name` variable inside the string.\n* The function prints the constructed greeting message to the console.\n* An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to call `print_greeting` with a specific name, such as \"John\".",
