  "answer": "**Transposing a List of Lists**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses the built-in `zip` function to transpose a list of lists.\n\n```python\ndef transpose(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transpose a list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists to be transposed.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list of lists where the elements are transposed.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(map(list, zip(*list_of_lists)))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    # Define a list of lists\n    list_of_lists = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n\n    # Transpose the list of lists\n    transposed = transpose(list_of_lists)\n\n    # Print the original and transposed lists\n    print(\"Original List:\")\n    for row in list_of_lists:\n        print(row)\n\n    print(\"\\nTransposed List:\")\n    for row in transposed:\n        print(row)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `transpose` function takes a list of lists as input.\n2. The `zip(*list_of_lists)` expression unpacks the input list of lists and passes each inner list as a separate argument to the `zip` function. This transposes the elements.\n3. The `map(list, ...)` expression converts each tuple returned by `zip` into a list.\n4. The `list(...)` expression converts the iterator returned by `map` into a list of lists.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nOriginal List:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[7, 8, 9]\n\nTransposed List:\n[1, 4, 7]\n[2, 5, 8]\n[3, 6, 9]\n```\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that all inner lists have the same length. If the inner lists have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shortest list. If you need to handle lists with different lengths, you may need to use a more complex implementation, such as using the `itertools.zip_longest` function.",
