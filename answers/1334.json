  "answer": "**Sentence Splitter Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string as input, splits it into individual sentences, and returns them as a list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_into_sentences(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits a given text into individual sentences.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sentences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expression to split the text into sentences\n    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]\\s*', text)\n    \n    # Remove any empty strings from the list\n    sentences = [sentence for sentence in sentences if sentence]\n    \n    return sentences\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = \"Hello world! This is a test. How are you?\"\n    print(split_into_sentences(text))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `split_into_sentences` takes a string `text` as input.\n2. It uses a regular expression to split the text into sentences. The regular expression `[.!?]\\s*` matches any of the sentence-ending punctuation marks (`.`, `!`, `?`) followed by zero or more whitespace characters.\n3. The `re.split` function splits the text into substrings at each match of the regular expression.\n4. The list comprehension `[sentence for sentence in sentences if sentence]` removes any empty strings from the list of sentences.\n5. The function returns the list of sentences.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```python\n['Hello world', 'This is a test', 'How are you']\n```",
