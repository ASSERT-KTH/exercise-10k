  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a password until they enter a valid one. A valid password should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks for a valid password using a while loop:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_valid_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the password is valid.\n    \n    A valid password should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, \n    one lowercase letter, and one digit.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    password (str): The password to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n    \n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Continuously asks the user for a password until they enter a valid one.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        password = input(\"Please enter a password: \")\n        \n        if is_valid_password(password):\n            print(\"Password is valid. You may proceed.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:\")\n            print(\"  - At least 8 characters long\")\n            print(\"  - Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n            print(\"  - Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n            print(\"  - Contains at least one digit\")\n            print(\"Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program checks the length of the password and uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. If the password does not meet the criteria, it will print out a message explaining what is missing and ask the user to try again. If the password is valid, it will print out a success message and exit.",
