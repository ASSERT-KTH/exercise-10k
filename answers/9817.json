  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two integers and an arithmetic operator as input and performs the corresponding operation. The operators to consider are: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Handle cases where the operator is not one of the above or where division by zero occurs.",

It handles cases where the operator is not one of the above or where division by zero occurs by raising exceptions. The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result. It also catches and handles any exceptions that may occur.",
