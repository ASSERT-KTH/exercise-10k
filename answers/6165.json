  "answer": "### Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Function\n#### Description\nThis function allows a user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_rock_paper_scissors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get user's choice\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors), or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n\n        # Check if user wants to quit\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n\n        # Validate user's choice\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Generate computer's choice\n        choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Print out choices\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n\n        # Determine winner\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == 'rock':\n            if computer_choice == 'scissors':\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == 'paper':\n            if computer_choice == 'rock':\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == 'scissors':\n            if computer_choice == 'paper':\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_rock_paper_scissors()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `play_rock_paper_scissors` function runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to quit.\n2. The user is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).\n3. The user's choice is validated to ensure it is one of the three options.\n4. The computer's choice is generated randomly from the list of options.\n5. The user's and computer's choices are printed out.\n6. The winner is determined based on the game's rules:\n   - Rock smashes scissors.\n   - Paper covers rock.\n   - Scissors cuts paper.\n7. The result of the game is printed out.\n\n#### Running the Code\nSave the code to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
