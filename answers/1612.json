  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and outputs its area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return area, perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Area: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_rectangle_properties` function takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns a tuple containing its area and perimeter.\n*   The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width.\n*   The perimeter is calculated by adding the length and width, then multiplying by 2.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the length and width of the rectangle.\n*   The `calculate_rectangle_properties` function is called with the user's input, and the results are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of a rectangle. For example, if you enter `5` for the length and `3` for the width, the program will output:\n\n```\nArea: 15.00\nPerimeter: 16.00\n```",
