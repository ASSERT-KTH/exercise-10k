  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result of the operation. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): \")\n    \n    try:\n        result = calculator(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of the operation is {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculator` function takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation.\n*   It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n*   It raises a `ValueError` if the operation is not one of the supported operations and a `ZeroDivisionError` if the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n*   The `main` function gets the two numbers and the operation from the user, calls the `calculator` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also handles any exceptions that may be raised by the `calculator` function and prints the error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Addition**: Enter `5` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `addition` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 8.0`.\n*   **Subtraction**: Enter `10` as the first number, `4` as the second number, and `subtraction` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 6.0`.\n*   **Multiplication**: Enter `7` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `multiplication` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 14.0`.\n*   **Division**: Enter `9` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `division` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 3.0`.\n*   **Unsupported Operation**: Enter `5` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `modulus` as the operation. The output will be `Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'.`.\n*   **Division by Zero**: Enter `5` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `division` as the operation. The output will be `Cannot divide by zero`.",
