  "answer": "**Word Presence Checker**\n\nBelow is a Python program that checks if a given word is present in a sentence.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef check_word_presence(sentence, word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a word is present in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n        word (str): The word to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the word is present, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both sentence and word to lower case to make the search case-insensitive\n    sentence = sentence.lower()\n    word = word.lower()\n\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Remove punctuation from each word\n    words = [w.strip('.,!?;:\"\\'') for w in words]\n\n    # Check if the word is present in the list of words\n    return word in words\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n\n    # Check if the word is present in the sentence\n    if check_word_presence(sentence, word):\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is present in the sentence.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is not present in the sentence.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a sentence when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world, this is a test sentence\").\n3. Enter a word when prompted (e.g., \"test\").\n4. The program will output whether the word is present in the sentence or not.\n\nNote: This program considers \"word\" and \"Word\" as the same word (case-insensitive search). It also removes punctuation from the words in the sentence before checking for the presence of the given word.",
