  "answer": "**Variable Scope**\n====================\n\nIn programming, the scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where the variable is accessible. Understanding variable scope is crucial to avoid errors and ensure that variables are used correctly.\n\n**Types of Variable Scope**\n---------------------------\n\n1. **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n2. **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope. They can only be accessed within that function or block.\n3. **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a block (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`) have block scope. They can only be accessed within that block.\n\n**Examples**\n------------\n\n### Global Scope\n\n```python\nx = 10  # global variable\n\ndef foo():\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n\nfoo()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n\n### Local Scope\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    y = 20  # local variable\n    print(y)  # prints 20\n\nfoo()\n# print(y)  # raises NameError: name 'y' is not defined\n```\n\n### Block Scope\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    j = i * 2  # block-scoped variable\n    print(j)\n\n# print(j)  # raises NameError: name 'j' is not defined\n```\n\n**Variable Shadowing**\n----------------------\n\nWhen a variable with the same name is declared in an inner scope, it can shadow the outer scope variable. This means that the inner scope variable will be used instead of the outer scope variable.\n\n```python\nx = 10  # global variable\n\ndef foo():\n    x = 20  # local variable, shadows global variable\n    print(x)  # prints 20\n\nfoo()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n\n**Best Practices**\n------------------\n\n1. **Use meaningful variable names**: Avoid using single-letter variable names or names that are similar to built-in functions or variables.\n2. **Use scope-specific variables**: Use global variables sparingly and prefer local or block-scoped variables when possible.\n3. **Avoid variable shadowing**: Use distinct variable names to avoid shadowing outer scope variables.\n\nBy understanding variable scope and following best practices, you can write more maintainable and efficient code.",
