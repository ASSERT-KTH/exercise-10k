  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input from the user, then performs the specified operation and prints out the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    # Take in two numbers and an operator from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform the specified operation\n    if operator == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == \"/\":\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n            return\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /\")\n        return\n\n    # Print out the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculator()\n```\n\n### How it works\n1. **User Input**: The program first takes in two numbers and an operator from the user using the `input` function.\n2. **Operation Selection**: It then uses an `if-elif-else` block to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered by the user.\n3. **Error Checking**: The program checks for division by zero and invalid operators, printing an error message and returning if either condition is met.\n4. **Result Calculation**: If the operator is valid and division by zero is not attempted, the program calculates the result of the operation.\n5. **Result Output**: Finally, it prints out the result of the operation in the format `num1 operator num2 = result`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Addition: `Enter the first number: 5`, `Enter the operator: +`, `Enter the second number: 3`\n\t+ Output: `5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0`\n* Subtraction: `Enter the first number: 10`, `Enter the operator: -`, `Enter the second number: 4`\n\t+ Output: `10.0 - 4.0 = 6.0`\n* Multiplication: `Enter the first number: 7`, `Enter the operator: *`, `Enter the second number: 2`\n\t+ Output: `7.0 * 2.0 = 14.0`\n* Division: `Enter the first number: 9`, `Enter the operator: /`, `Enter the second number: 3`\n\t+ Output: `9.0 / 3.0 = 3.0`",
