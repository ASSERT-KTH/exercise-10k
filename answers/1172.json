  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a string, count the frequency of each character.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution using a dictionary to store the character frequencies:\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequencies(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequencies(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the character frequencies.\n2. Iterate over each character `char` in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1.\n4. If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a frequency of 1.\n5. Return the dictionary containing the character frequencies.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `count_character_frequencies` function. It takes the input string \"Hello, World!\" and prints the frequency of each character.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use the `collections.Counter` class from the Python Standard Library to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_character_frequencies(input_string):\n    return Counter(input_string)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequencies(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution is more concise and efficient, as it leverages the optimized implementation of the `Counter` class.",
