  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their first and last names, then prints out a greeting message with their full name.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program that accomplishes this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's first and last names.\"\"\"\n    first_name = input(\"Please enter your first name: \")\n    last_name = input(\"Please enter your last name: \")\n    return first_name, last_name\n\ndef print_greeting(first_name, last_name):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message with the user's full name.\"\"\"\n    full_name = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n    print(\"Hello, \" + full_name + \"!\")\n\ndef main():\n    first_name, last_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(first_name, last_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines three functions:\n\n1. `get_user_name()`: Asks the user for their first and last names using the built-in `input()` function and returns them as a tuple.\n2. `print_greeting()`: Takes the first and last names as arguments, combines them into a full name, and prints out a greeting message with the full name.\n3. `main()`: Calls `get_user_name()` to get the user's names and then calls `print_greeting()` to print out the greeting message.\n\nThe `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported as a module in another script), and if so, it calls the `main()` function to start the program.\n\nYou can run this program, and it will ask you for your first and last names, then print out a greeting message with your full name.",
