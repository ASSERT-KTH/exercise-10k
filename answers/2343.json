  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it, providing hints if the guess is too high or too low.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \"))\n            if 1 <= guess <= 100:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the random number guessing game.\"\"\"\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        user_guess = get_user_guess()\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. Enter a whole number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will provide a hint if the guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to find the correct number.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `get_user_guess` function gets the user's guess and validates it to ensure it's a whole number between 1 and 100.\n2. The `play_game` function generates a random number and plays the game.\n3. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.\n4. After each guess, the program provides a hint if the guess is too high or too low.\n5. The program keeps track of the number of attempts it takes to find the correct number.",
