  "answer": "### Abundant Number Checker Function\n\nAn abundant number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_abundant(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is an abundant number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is abundant, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors\n    sum_of_divisors = sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)\n\n    # Check if the sum of divisors is greater than the number\n    return sum_of_divisors > n\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers_to_check = [12, 18, 20, 24]\n    for num in numbers_to_check:\n        if is_abundant(num):\n            print(f\"{num} is an abundant number\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{num} is not an abundant number\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_abundant` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's a positive integer. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. It calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` using a generator expression, which iterates over numbers from 1 to `n-1` and checks if each number is a divisor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n3. The function returns `True` if the sum of divisors is greater than `n`, indicating that `n` is an abundant number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n* The number 12 is abundant because its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) sum to 16, which is greater than 12.\n* The number 18 is not abundant because its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 6, 9) sum to 21, which is greater than 18, so it is actually abundant.\n* The number 20 is abundant because its proper divisors (1, 2, 4, 5, 10) sum to 22, which is greater than 20.\n* The number 24 is abundant because its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12) sum to 36, which is greater than 24.",
