  "answer": "**Single Number Function**\n==========================\n\nHere's a Python function that finds the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef single_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The single number that appears only once.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        # XOR operation: a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a\n        result ^= num\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [2, 2, 1]\n    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 1\n\n    nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n    print(single_number(nums))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses the XOR operation, which has the following properties:\n\n* `a ^ a = 0` (any number XOR itself is 0)\n* `a ^ 0 = a` (any number XOR 0 is itself)\n* `a ^ b = b ^ a` (XOR operation is commutative)\n\nBy XORing all numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out (since `a ^ a = 0`), leaving only the single number that appears once.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we're iterating over the array once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), since we're only using a constant amount of space to store the result.",
