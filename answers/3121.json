  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user enters \"quit\", the program reveals the number and ends.\n4. The program attempts to convert the user's guess to an integer. If this fails, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends.\n6. If the user's guess is incorrect, the program gives a hint (\"too high\" or \"too low\") and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nHere's an example of how the program might be used:\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nToo low!\nTake a guess: 75\nToo low!\nTake a guess: 87\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
