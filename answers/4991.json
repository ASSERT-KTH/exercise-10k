  "answer": "**Variable Scope**\n===============\n\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and can be accessed. The scope of a variable determines its visibility and lifetime.\n\n**Types of Variable Scope**\n-------------------------\n\n1. **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n2. **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function or block have local scope. They can only be accessed within that function or block.\n3. **Enclosing Scope**: Variables defined in an outer function or block can be accessed by inner functions or blocks.\n\n**Example**\n---------\n\nHere is an example in Python that demonstrates variable scope:\n```python\n# Global scope\nx = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing scope\n    y = 20\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local scope\n        z = 30\n        print(\"Inner function:\")\n        print(\"x (global):\", x)\n        print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n        print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Outer function:\")\n    print(\"x (global):\", x)\n    print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n    # print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise a NameError\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global scope:\")\nprint(\"x (global):\", x)\n# print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)  # This would raise a NameError\n# print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise a NameError\n```\nIn this example:\n\n* `x` has global scope and can be accessed from anywhere.\n* `y` has enclosing scope and can be accessed by the `inner_function`.\n* `z` has local scope and can only be accessed within the `inner_function`.\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll see that the `inner_function` can access `x`, `y`, and `z`, while the `outer_function` can access `x` and `y`, but not `z`. The global scope can only access `x`.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n----------------\n\n* Variables have scope, which determines their visibility and lifetime.\n* Global variables can be accessed from anywhere, while local variables can only be accessed within their defining block or function.\n* Enclosing variables can be accessed by inner blocks or functions.",
