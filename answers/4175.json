  "answer": "**Word Guessing Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random word and allows the user to guess it by suggesting letters. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of:\n\n* `*` for letters that are not in the word\n* The letter itself for letters that are in the word, in the correct position\n* `_` for letters that are in the word, but not in the correct position\n\nThe game continues until the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nword_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef word_guessing_game():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word)\n    \n    # Initialize the guessed word with underscores\n    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 6\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Guessing Game!\")\n    print(f\"You have {attempts} attempts to guess the word.\")\n    \n    while attempts > 0 and '_' in guessed_word:\n        # Print the current state of the guessed word\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n        \n        # Ask the user for a letter\n        letter = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n        \n        # Check if the letter is in the word\n        if letter in word:\n            # Check if the letter is in the correct position\n            for i, char in enumerate(word):\n                if char == letter:\n                    guessed_word[i] = letter\n        else:\n            # Decrement the number of attempts\n            attempts -= 1\n            print(f\"Incorrect! You have {attempts} attempts left.\")\n    \n    # Check if the user guessed the word\n    if '_' not in guessed_word:\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n        print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the word.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you didn't guess the word. The word was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    word_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nWelcome to the Word Guessing Game!\nYou have 6 attempts to guess the word.\n_ _ _ _ _\nGuess a letter: e\n_ e _ _ _\nGuess a letter: a\n_ e a _ _\nGuess a letter: t\n_ e a t _\nGuess a letter: s\n_ e a t s\nCongratulations! You guessed the word.\n```\n\nNote: This program uses a simple list of words to choose from. You can modify the `word_list` variable to add or remove words. Additionally, you can adjust the number of attempts and the length of the words to suit your needs.",
