  "answer": "Here's a high-quality, readable, and well-documented code to pivot a dictionary from rows to columns.\n\n### Pivot Dictionary\n#### Problem Statement\nYou have a dictionary where each key represents a row and its corresponding value is another dictionary with column names as keys and values as cell values. You want to pivot this dictionary so that each key represents a column and its corresponding value is a list of cell values.\n\n#### Solution\n```python\ndef pivot_dict(row_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Pivot a dictionary from rows to columns.\n\n    Args:\n        row_dict (dict): A dictionary where each key represents a row and its corresponding value is another dictionary with column names as keys and values as cell values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key represents a column and its corresponding value is a list of cell values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the pivoted data\n    col_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the input dictionary\n    for row, row_values in row_dict.items():\n        # Iterate over each column in the current row\n        for col, value in row_values.items():\n            # If the column is not already in the pivoted dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value\n            if col not in col_dict:\n                col_dict[col] = []\n            # Append the current cell value to the list of values for the current column\n            col_dict[col].append(value)\n\n    return col_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nrow_dict = {\n    'row1': {'col1': 1, 'col2': 2, 'col3': 3},\n    'row2': {'col1': 4, 'col2': 5, 'col3': 6},\n    'row3': {'col1': 7, 'col2': 8, 'col3': 9}\n}\n\npivoted_dict = pivot_dict(row_dict)\nprint(pivoted_dict)\n```\n\n#### Output\n```python\n{\n    'col1': [1, 4, 7],\n    'col2': [2, 5, 8],\n    'col3': [3, 6, 9]\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pivot_dict` that takes a dictionary `row_dict` as input and returns a new dictionary `col_dict` where each key represents a column and its corresponding value is a list of cell values. The function iterates over each row in the input dictionary, and for each column in the current row, it appends the cell value to the list of values for the current column in the pivoted dictionary. Finally, the function returns the pivoted dictionary.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a sample `row_dict` with three rows and three columns, and then call the `pivot_dict` function to pivot the dictionary. The resulting `pivoted_dict` is printed to the console, showing the expected output.",
