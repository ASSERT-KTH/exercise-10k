  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates tax based on a given income. The tax rates used in this example are hypothetical and for demonstration purposes only.\n\n```python\n# Define tax brackets and rates\ntax_brackets = [\n    (0, 9875, 0.10),  # 10% on the first $9,875\n    (9876, 40125, 0.12),  # 12% on income between $9,876 and $40,125\n    (40126, 85525, 0.22),  # 22% on income between $40,126 and $85,525\n    (85526, 163300, 0.24),  # 24% on income between $85,526 and $163,300\n    (163301, 207350, 0.32),  # 32% on income between $163,301 and $207,350\n    (207351, 518400, 0.35),  # 35% on income between $207,351 and $518,400\n    (518401, float('inf'), 0.37)  # 37% on income above $518,400\n]\n\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate tax based on the given income and tax brackets.\n    \n    Args:\n    income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The calculated tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax = 0.0\n    remaining_income = income\n    \n    for bracket in tax_brackets:\n        lower_bound, upper_bound, rate = bracket\n        \n        # Calculate the income within the current bracket\n        income_in_bracket = min(upper_bound, remaining_income) - lower_bound\n        \n        # If the income is within the current bracket, calculate the tax and break\n        if income_in_bracket > 0:\n            tax += income_in_bracket * rate\n            remaining_income -= income_in_bracket\n            \n            # If all income has been processed, break the loop\n            if remaining_income <= 0:\n                break\n    \n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `tax_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python tax_calculator.py`.\n4. Enter your income when prompted, and the program will print out the calculated tax.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis program uses a simplified tax calculation model and does not take into account other factors that may affect tax, such as deductions, exemptions, and state taxes. The tax rates and brackets used in this example are hypothetical and may not reflect the actual tax laws in your country or region.",
