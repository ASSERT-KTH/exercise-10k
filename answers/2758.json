  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the selling price of an item given its cost and markup percentage.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the selling price of an item given its cost and markup percentage:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage):\n    # Calculate the markup amount\n    markup_amount = (cost / 100) * markup_percentage\n    \n    # Calculate the selling price\n    selling_price = cost + markup_amount\n    \n    return selling_price\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the cost of the item from the user\n    cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the item: $\"))\n    \n    # Get the markup percentage from the user\n    markup_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the markup percentage (%): \"))\n    \n    # Calculate the selling price\n    selling_price = calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage)\n    \n    # Print the selling price\n    print(f\"The selling price of the item is: ${selling_price:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_selling_price` function takes the cost of the item and the markup percentage as input, calculates the markup amount, and then calculates the selling price by adding the markup amount to the cost.\n* The `main` function gets the cost and markup percentage from the user, calls the `calculate_selling_price` function to calculate the selling price, and then prints the result.\n* The program uses the `float` function to convert the user's input into a floating-point number, which allows for decimal points.\n* The program uses an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter the cost of the item when prompted. For example, enter `$100`.\n* Enter the markup percentage when prompted. For example, enter `20`.\n* The program will calculate and print the selling price, which in this case would be `$120.00`.",
