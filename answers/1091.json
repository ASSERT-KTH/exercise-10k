  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the total bill and the tip percentage as input and outputs the total amount to pay.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_bill(bill, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total amount to pay based on the bill and tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        bill (float): The total bill.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount to pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = bill * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    total_amount = bill + tip_amount\n    return total_amount\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the total bill and tip percentage from the user\n    bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the total amount to pay\n    total_amount = calculate_total_bill(bill, tip_percentage)\n    print(f\"The total amount to pay is: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_total_bill` function takes two arguments: `bill` (the total bill) and `tip_percentage` (the tip percentage).\n*   It calculates the tip amount by multiplying the bill with the tip percentage divided by 100.\n*   Then, it calculates the total amount to pay by adding the bill and the tip amount.\n*   The `main` function gets the total bill and tip percentage from the user, calls `calculate_total_bill`, and displays the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the total bill is $100 and the tip percentage is 15%, the program will output: `The total amount to pay is: $115.00`\n*   If the total bill is $50 and the tip percentage is 20%, the program will output: `The total amount to pay is: $60.00`",
