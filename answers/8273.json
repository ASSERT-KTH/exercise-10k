  "answer": "**Subtraction Quiz Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user a series of subtraction questions and keeps track of the score. The questions are generated randomly with numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef subtraction_quiz(num_questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user a series of subtraction questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n    Args:\n        num_questions (int): The number of questions to ask.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for i in range(num_questions):\n        num1 = random.randint(1, 100)\n        num2 = random.randint(1, num1)\n        correct_answer = num1 - num2\n\n        user_answer = input(f\"What is {num1} - {num2}? \")\n        try:\n            user_answer = int(user_answer)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n\n        if user_answer == correct_answer:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {correct_answer}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Quiz over! Your final score is {score} out of {num_questions}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    num_questions = int(input(\"How many questions would you like to answer? \"))\n    subtraction_quiz(num_questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of questions you would like to answer when prompted.\n3. Answer each subtraction question to the best of your ability.\n4. The program will keep track of your score and display it at the end.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `random` module is used to generate random numbers for the questions.\n* The `subtraction_quiz` function takes the number of questions as an argument and asks the user that many questions.\n* The `main` function gets the number of questions from the user and calls the `subtraction_quiz` function.\n* The program handles invalid input (e.g., non-numeric answers) by prompting the user to enter a number.",
