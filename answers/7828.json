  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple calculator program that takes in two numbers and an operator \n    as input from the user and then performs the specified operation, \n    printing out the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get the first number from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Get the operator from the user\n    while True:\n        operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if operator in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid operator. Please enter +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n    # Get the second number from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Cannot divide by zero. Please enter a non-zero number.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    while True:\n        cont = input(\"Do you want to continue? (y/n): \")\n        if cont.lower() == 'y':\n            calculator()\n        elif cont.lower() == 'n':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter y or n.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The program defines a `calculator` function that takes no arguments.\n2. The function prompts the user to enter the first number, operator, and second number.\n3. It checks if the input is valid for each prompt. If not, it keeps asking until valid input is entered.\n4. After getting all the inputs, it performs the specified operation based on the operator and prints the result.\n5. The `main` function calls the `calculator` function and asks the user if they want to continue. If they answer 'y', it calls the `calculator` function again. If they answer 'n', it breaks the loop and ends the program.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the operator (+, -, *, /): +\nEnter the second number: 5\n10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0\nDo you want to continue? (y/n): y\nEnter the first number: 20\nEnter the operator (+, -, *, /): *\nEnter the second number: 3\n20.0 * 3.0 = 60.0\nDo you want to continue? (y/n): n\n```",
