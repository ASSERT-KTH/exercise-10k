  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the operation and prints the result. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Supports 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is supported\n    if operation not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation and return the result\n    return operations[operation](num1, num2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \").lower()\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the result\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        if result == float('inf'):\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n*   It uses a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding lambda functions for easy lookup and execution.\n*   The function includes input validation to ensure the operation is supported and handles division by zero by returning infinity.\n*   The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also includes error handling to catch and display any invalid operation errors or division by zero errors.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Addition: Input `5` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `add` as the operation. The program will output `The result of adding 5.0 and 3.0 is 8.0.`\n*   Subtraction: Input `10` as the first number, `4` as the second number, and `subtract` as the operation. The program will output `The result of subtracting 10.0 and 4.0 is 6.0.`\n*   Multiplication: Input `7` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `multiply` as the operation. The program will output `The result of multiplying 7.0 and 2.0 is 14.0.`\n*   Division: Input `9` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `divide` as the operation. The program will output `The result of dividing 9.0 and 3.0 is 3.0.`\n\nNote that the program will handle invalid operations and division by zero by displaying an error message.",
