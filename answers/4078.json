  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a compressed string as input and returns the original string.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses a stack-based approach to decompress the string:\n\n```python\ndef decompress_string(compressed_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decompresses a compressed string.\n\n    The compressed string is in the format 'a1b2c3', which represents 'abbccc'.\n    The number following each character represents how many times the character should be repeated.\n\n    Args:\n        compressed_str (str): The compressed string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The decompressed string.\n    \"\"\"\n    decompressed_str = \"\"\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(compressed_str):\n        char = compressed_str[i]\n        count = \"\"\n\n        # Get the count of the character\n        i += 1\n        while i < len(compressed_str) and compressed_str[i].isdigit():\n            count += compressed_str[i]\n            i += 1\n\n        # If no count is specified, assume it is 1\n        if count == \"\":\n            count = \"1\"\n\n        # Add the character to the decompressed string 'count' times\n        decompressed_str += char * int(count)\n\n    return decompressed_str\n\n\n# Test the function\ncompressed_str = \"a1b2c3\"\nprint(decompress_string(compressed_str))  # Outputs: abbccc\n```\n\nThis program iterates over the input string, treating each character as the start of a new sequence. It then reads the following digits as the count for that sequence, and adds the character to the output string that many times. If no count is specified, it defaults to 1. The result is the decompressed string.",
