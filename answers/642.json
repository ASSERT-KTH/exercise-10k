  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses a while loop to continuously read and print input from the user until the user types 'exit':\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Please enter a message (type 'exit' to quit): \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `main` function contains a `while` loop that runs indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement.\n*   Inside the loop, the `input` function is used to get user input.\n*   The program checks if the user input is 'exit' (case-insensitive) and breaks out of the loop if it is.\n*   If the input is not 'exit', it prints out the user's input.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Save the above code in a file named `continuous_input.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program by typing `python continuous_input.py`.\n4.  The program will prompt you to enter a message. Type anything and press Enter to see it printed back to you.\n5.  To exit the program, type 'exit' and press Enter. The program will print a farewell message and terminate.",
