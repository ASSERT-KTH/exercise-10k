  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime by iterating over numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, we return `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n6. In the `main` function, we take a user input, convert it to an integer, and pass it to the `is_prime` function.\n7. Based on the result, we print whether the number is prime or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `25` - Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23` - Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `37` - Output: `37 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `48` - Output: `48 is not a prime number.`\n\nNote: This program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to moderate-sized integers. For larger integers, more advanced algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
