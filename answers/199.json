  "answer": "**Matrix Multiplication Program**\n====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a nested for loop to multiply two matrices. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it's used extensively in many fields, including computer science, physics, and engineering.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiply two matrices using a nested for loop.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix1 (list): The first matrix.\n        matrix2 (list): The second matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The product of the two matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the dimensions of the matrices\n    rows1 = len(matrix1)\n    cols1 = len(matrix1[0])\n    rows2 = len(matrix2)\n    cols2 = len(matrix2[0])\n\n    # Check if the matrices can be multiplied\n    if cols1 != rows2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Matrices cannot be multiplied\")\n\n    # Create a result matrix filled with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols2)] for _ in range(rows1)]\n\n    # Multiply the matrices using a nested for loop\n    for i in range(rows1):\n        for j in range(cols2):\n            for k in range(cols1):\n                result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j]\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print a matrix in a readable format.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): The matrix to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(\" \".join(str(x) for x in row))\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define two example matrices\n    matrix1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n    matrix2 = [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]\n\n    # Multiply the matrices\n    result = multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Matrix 1:\")\n    print_matrix(matrix1)\n    print(\"\\nMatrix 2:\")\n    print_matrix(matrix2)\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print_matrix(result)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `multiply_matrices` function takes two matrices as input and returns their product.\n2. It first checks if the matrices can be multiplied by comparing the number of columns in the first matrix with the number of rows in the second matrix.\n3. If the matrices can be multiplied, it creates a result matrix filled with zeros and then uses a nested for loop to multiply the matrices.\n4. The `print_matrix` function is used to print a matrix in a readable format.\n5. In the `main` function, two example matrices are defined, multiplied, and the result is printed.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nThe program can be used to multiply any two matrices. For example, you can modify the `main` function to multiply two matrices of your choice.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input matrices are valid (i.e., they are lists of lists, and each inner list has the same length). You may want to add additional error checking to handle invalid inputs.",
