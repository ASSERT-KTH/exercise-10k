  "prompt": "Write a function that takes no arguments and prints 'Hello World' to the console.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll provide you with a function that prints a greeting message to the console. This function takes no arguments and can be used as a simple example of a Python function. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# This is a function that takes no arguments and prints 'Hello World' to the console.\ndef hello_world():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints 'Hello World' to the console.\n\n    Args:\n        None\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # The print function in Python is used to print output to the screen.\n    # We pass the string 'Hello World' to the print function to print it.\n    print('Hello World')\n\n# To call the function, we simply type its name followed by parentheses.\nhello_world()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `hello_world` is defined with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return values. In this case, it takes no arguments (`None`) and returns no value (`None`).\n* Inside the function, the `print` function is used to output the string `'Hello World'` to the console.\n* To call the function, we simply type its name followed by parentheses, as seen in the last line of the code: `hello_world()`.\n* The function can be used as a starting point for more complex programs or as a simple example of a Python function.",
