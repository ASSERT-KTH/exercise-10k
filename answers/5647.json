  "answer": "### Calculating the Area of a Rectangle\n#### Function Description\n\nThe `calculate_rectangle_area` function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n    Args:\n    - length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n    - width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n    \n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n* The function takes two parameters: `length` and `width`, both of type `float`.\n* It checks if either the length or width is less than or equal to 0, and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n* The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width.\n* The result is returned as a `float`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5.0 and a width of 3.0.",
