  "answer": "**Question Answering Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program takes a set of questions and answers as input, asks the user to answer the questions, and keeps track of the score.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# question_answerer.py\n\nclass QuestionAnswerer:\n    def __init__(self, questions):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the QuestionAnswerer with a dictionary of questions and answers.\n\n        Args:\n            questions (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the questions and the values are the answers.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.questions = questions\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def ask_questions(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Ask the user to answer the questions and keep track of the score.\n        \"\"\"\n        for question, answer in self.questions.items():\n            user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n            if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n                print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n                self.score += 1\n            else:\n                print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\\n\")\n\n    def print_score(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print the final score.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Your final score is {self.score} out of {len(self.questions)}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    questions = {\n        \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n        \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"Who wrote the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\": \"Harper Lee\"\n    }\n\n    question_answerer = QuestionAnswerer(questions)\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz! Please answer the following questions:\")\n    question_answerer.ask_questions()\n    question_answerer.print_score()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a `QuestionAnswerer` class that takes a dictionary of questions and answers as input.\n2. The `ask_questions` method asks the user to answer each question and checks if the answer is correct. If correct, it increments the score.\n3. The `print_score` method prints the final score.\n4. In the `main` function, we create an instance of `QuestionAnswerer` with a sample set of questions and answers.\n5. We call the `ask_questions` method to start the quiz and then print the final score using the `print_score` method.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program using `python question_answerer.py`.\n2. Answer the questions prompted by the program.\n3. The program will display the correct answers and keep track of your score.\n4. After answering all questions, the program will display your final score.",
