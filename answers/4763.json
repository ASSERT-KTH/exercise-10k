  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a password meets certain criteria. The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If the password meets the criteria, print 'Valid password'. If it doesn't, print 'Invalid password'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks if a password meets the given criteria:\n\n```python\ndef check_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a password meets the criteria:\n    - At least 8 characters long\n    - Contains at least one uppercase letter\n    - Contains at least one lowercase letter\n    - Contains at least one digit\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    # If all checks pass, the password is valid\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the password from the user\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n\n    # Check if the password is valid\n    if check_password(password):\n        print(\"Valid password\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid password\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `check_password` that checks if a given password meets the criteria. It then defines a `main` function that gets a password from the user, checks its validity using `check_password`, and prints a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter a password when prompted. The program will then print a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* If you enter a password that is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit (e.g., \"Password123\"), the program will print \"Valid password\".\n* If you enter a password that is less than 8 characters long (e.g., \"Short1\"), the program will print \"Invalid password\".\n* If you enter a password that does not contain at least one uppercase letter (e.g., \"alllowercase1\"), the program will print \"Invalid password\".\n* If you enter a password that does not contain at least one lowercase letter (e.g., \"ALLUPPERCASE1\"), the program will print \"Invalid password\".\n* If you enter a password that does not contain at least one digit (e.g., \"NoDigits\"), the program will print \"Invalid password\".",
