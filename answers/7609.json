  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses membership operators to check if a variable is in a sequence (list, tuple, or string).\n\n```python\ndef check_membership(sequence, variable):\n    if variable in sequence:\n        print(f\"'{variable}' is in the sequence.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"'{variable}' is not in the sequence.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Test with a list\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    variable = 3\n    print(\"Checking membership in a list:\")\n    check_membership(my_list, variable)\n\n    # Test with a tuple\n    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n    print(\"\\nChecking membership in a tuple:\")\n    check_membership(my_tuple, variable)\n\n    # Test with a string\n    my_string = \"hello\"\n    variable = 'l'\n    print(\"\\nChecking membership in a string:\")\n    check_membership(my_string, variable)\n\n    # Test with a variable not in the sequence\n    variable = 6\n    print(\"\\nChecking membership with a variable not in the sequence:\")\n    check_membership(my_list, variable)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We define a function `check_membership` that takes a sequence and a variable as arguments.\n2.  Inside the function, we use the `in` operator to check if the variable is in the sequence.\n3.  If the variable is in the sequence, we print a message indicating that it is. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it is not.\n4.  In the `main` function, we test the `check_membership` function with different sequences (list, tuple, and string) and variables.\n5.  We also test the function with a variable that is not in the sequence to demonstrate the `else` case.\n\n### Membership Operators\n\n*   `in`: Returns `True` if a variable is found in a sequence, `False` otherwise.\n*   `not in`: Returns `True` if a variable is not found in a sequence, `False` otherwise.\n\nThese operators can be used with lists, tuples, strings, and other iterable types in Python.",
