  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Program**\n========================\n\nBelow is an example of a bubble sort program implemented in Python.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Repeat the process until the list is sorted\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Initialize a flag to check if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n - i - 1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n                # Set the flag to True\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the list is sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a list of numbers\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n\n    # Print the original list\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n\n    # Sort the list using bubble sort\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n\n    # Print the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list.\n*   The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list.\n*   The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n*   The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `bubble_sort` function to sort a list of numbers.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\n*   Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the input list is already sorted.\n*   Average-case time complexity: O(n^2) for random input lists.\n*   Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the input list is sorted in reverse order.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\n*   The bubble sort algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the temporary swaps.",
