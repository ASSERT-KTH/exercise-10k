  "answer": "**Odd Number Printer Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that uses a for loop to print the odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\")\n    print_odd_numbers()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `print_odd_numbers` function iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.\n2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is odd by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 != 0`).\n3. If the number is odd, it prints the number.\n\n**Alternative implementation with a while loop:**\n```python\ndef print_odd_numbers_while():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i <= 10:\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(i)\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10 (while loop):\")\n    print_odd_numbers_while()\n```\n\nBoth programs will output:\n```\nOdd numbers from 1 to 10:\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n```",
