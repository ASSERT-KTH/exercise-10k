  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the result of a mathematical expression. The function should take a string as an argument, where the string is a mathematical expression, and return the result.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the result of a mathematical expression passed as a string, and provide a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expression(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the result of a mathematical expression.\n    \n    Args:\n        expression (str): A string representing a mathematical expression.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the mathematical expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input is a string. If not, raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(expression, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input must be a string.\")\n    \n    # Try to evaluate the expression. If it's not a valid mathematical expression, a SyntaxError will be raised.\n    try:\n        # Use the eval function to evaluate the expression. The eval function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.\n        result = eval(expression)\n        \n        # Return the result of the expression.\n        return result\n    \n    # Catch any exceptions that occur during evaluation, such as SyntaxError or NameError.\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Raise a ValueError with the exception message.\n        raise ValueError(f\"Failed to evaluate the expression: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_expression(\"1 + 2 * 3\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(calculate_expression(\"10 / 2\"))  # Output: 5.0\nprint(calculate_expression(\"5 - 3 + 2\"))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_expression` takes a string `expression` as input and checks if it's indeed a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then attempts to evaluate the expression using the `eval` function, which parses the expression and executes it as a Python expression. The result is stored in the `result` variable.\n* If any exceptions occur during evaluation (e.g., `SyntaxError` or `NameError`), the function catches them and raises a `ValueError` with the exception message.\n* Finally, the function returns the result of the expression if it's successfully evaluated.",
