  "answer": "**Happy Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nA happy number is defined by the following process:\n1. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.\n2. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.\n3. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef is_happy_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a happy number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is happy, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    while n != 1 and n not in seen:\n        seen.add(n)\n        n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))\n    return n == 1\n\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_happy_number(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a happy number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a happy number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `is_happy_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's a happy number.\n2. It uses a `set` to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far to avoid infinite loops.\n3. The function enters a loop where it calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `n` and updates `n` with this new value.\n4. The loop continues until `n` becomes 1 (indicating a happy number) or it encounters a number it has seen before (indicating a cycle).\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it's a happy number using the `is_happy_number` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: 19\n  Output: 19 is a happy number.\n* Input: 20\n  Output: 20 is not a happy number.",
