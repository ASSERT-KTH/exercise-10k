  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their division and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs the requested operation:\n\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the division and remainder of two integers.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n    quotient (int): The result of the division.\n    remainder (int): The remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    \n    # Check for division by zero\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `divide_and_remainder` function takes two integers as input, `dividend` and `divisor`, and calculates their division and remainder using the floor division operator `//` and the modulus operator `%`.\n*   The `main` function gets two integers as input from the user, checks if the divisor is zero to avoid a division by zero error, and then calls the `divide_and_remainder` function to calculate and print the division and remainder.\n*   The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the program's entry point and a `divide_and_remainder` function to perform the calculation. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.\n*   The program includes a docstring in the `divide_and_remainder` function to provide documentation and explain what the function does, its parameters, and its return values.",
