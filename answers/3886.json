  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n==========================\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Game Implementation\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_player_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the player's choice\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        player_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        if player_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return player_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice.

Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).\n4. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n5. You can choose to play again or quit the game.\n\nNote: This implementation provides a simple text-based interface for playing Rock, Paper, Scissors. You can modify the code to create a more advanced game with additional features, such as keeping track of scores or providing a graphical interface.",
