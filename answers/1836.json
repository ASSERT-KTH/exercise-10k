  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of all elements in a given array.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of squares of all elements in a given array:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(array):\n    return sum(i**2 for i in array)\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(array)\nprint(\"Sum of squares:\", result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sum_of_squares` that takes an array as input and returns the sum of squares of all elements in the array. The `sum` function is used with a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares.\n\nYou can replace the `array` variable in the example usage with your own array to calculate the sum of squares.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the NumPy library, which provides a more efficient way to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sum_of_squares(array):\n    return np.sum(np.square(array))\n\n# Example usage:\narray = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nresult = sum_of_squares(array)\nprint(\"Sum of squares:\", result)\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses the `np.square` function to square each element in the array, and then uses the `np.sum` function to calculate the sum of the squared elements.",
