  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a Loop**\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to print numbers from 1 to n\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints numbers from 1 to n using a loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"Printing numbers from 1 to {n}:\")\n    print_numbers(n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define a function `print_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. In each iteration, we print the current number `i`.\n4. In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we provide an example usage of the function by calling it with `n = 10`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nPrinting numbers from 1 to 10:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can modify the value of `n` to print numbers up to a different limit.",
