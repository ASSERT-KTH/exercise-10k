  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    years_to_check = [1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2100]\n    for year in years_to_check:\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year: {is_leap_year(year)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nA year is considered a leap year if it meets the following conditions:\n\n1. The year is evenly divisible by 4.\n2. The year is not evenly divisible by 100, unless...\n3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400.\n\nThe `is_leap_year` function implements these rules using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the year by 4 is 0, and either the year is not divisible by 100 or it is divisible by 400, the function returns `True`, indicating a leap year. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\n1999 is a leap year: False\n2000 is a leap year: True\n2001 is a leap year: False\n2004 is a leap year: True\n2100 is a leap year: False\n```",
