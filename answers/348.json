  "answer": "**Searching for an Element in a List**\n======================================\n\nHere's a Python function that performs a linear search on a list to find a specific element.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef search_list(element, lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        element (any): The element to search for.\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the index method to find the element\n        return lst.index(element)\n    except ValueError:\n        # Return -1 if the element is not found\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    target = 3\n    result = search_list(target, my_list)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `search_list` function takes two arguments: `element` (the item to search for) and `lst` (the list to search in).\n*   It uses the `index` method of the list to find the element. If the element is found, its index is returned.\n*   If the element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `search_list` function with an example list and target element.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the `index` method performs a linear search on the list.",
