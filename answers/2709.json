  "answer": "**Word Frequency Counter**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that counts the frequency of each word in a given text.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_word_frequency(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each word in the given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the unique words and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert text to lowercase\n    text = text.lower()\n\n    # Remove punctuation and special characters\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n\n    # Split text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Count word frequency\n    frequency = Counter(words)\n\n    return frequency\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    text = \"This is an example sentence. This sentence is just an example.\"\n    frequency = count_word_frequency(text)\n\n    print(\"Word Frequency:\")\n    for word, count in frequency.most_common():\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `count_word_frequency` function takes a text string as input.\n2. It converts the text to lowercase to ensure the word count is case-insensitive.\n3. It removes punctuation and special characters using a regular expression.\n4. It splits the text into individual words using the `split` method.\n5. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of the `count_word_frequency` function.\n7. It prints the word frequency in descending order using the `most_common` method.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nWord Frequency:\nthis: 2\nis: 2\nan: 2\nexample: 2\nsentence: 2\njust: 1\n```",
