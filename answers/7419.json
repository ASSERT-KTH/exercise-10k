  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a dictionary to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The program allows users to add, remove, and update student grades, and it can also calculate the average grade of all students.\n\n```python\nclass StudentGrades:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.grades = {}\n\n    def add_student(self, name, grade):\n        \"\"\"Add a student to the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.grades:\n            print(f\"Student {name} already exists. Please update their grade instead.\")\n        else:\n            self.grades[name] = grade\n            print(f\"Student {name} added with grade {grade}.\")\n\n    def remove_student(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Remove a student from the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.grades:\n            del self.grades[name]\n            print(f\"Student {name} removed.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student {name} does not exist.\")\n\n    def update_grade(self, name, new_grade):\n        \"\"\"Update a student's grade in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.grades:\n            self.grades[name] = new_grade\n            print(f\"Student {name}'s grade updated to {new_grade}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student {name} does not exist. Please add them first.\")\n\n    def calculate_average(self):\n        \"\"\"Calculate the average grade of all students.\"\"\"\n        if not self.grades:\n            print(\"No students exist.\")\n            return\n        average_grade = sum(self.grades.values()) / len(self.grades)\n        print(f\"The average grade is {average_grade:.2f}.\")\n\n    def display_grades(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all students and their grades.\"\"\"\n        if not self.grades:\n            print(\"No students exist.\")\n        else:\n            for name, grade in self.grades.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {grade}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    student_grades = StudentGrades()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\n1. Add student\")\n        print(\"2. Remove student\")\n        print(\"3. Update grade\")\n        print(\"4. Calculate average grade\")\n        print(\"5. Display grades\")\n        print(\"6. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n            grade = float(input(\"Enter student grade: \"))\n            student_grades.add_student(name, grade)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n            student_grades.remove_student(name)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n            new_grade = float(input(\"Enter new grade: \"))\n            student_grades.update_grade(name, new_grade)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            student_grades.calculate_average()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            student_grades.display_grades()\n        elif choice == \"6\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a `StudentGrades` class to encapsulate the dictionary of student grades and the methods to manipulate it. The `main` function provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with the program.\n\nNote that this program assumes that grades are floating-point numbers. If you want to use a different data type for grades, you can modify the program accordingly.\n\nExample usage:\n\n1. Run the program and choose option 1 to add a student. Enter the student's name and grade.\n2. Choose option 1 again to add another student.\n3. Choose option 4 to calculate the average grade of all students.\n4. Choose option 5 to display all students and their grades.\n5. Choose option 3 to update a student's grade.\n6. Choose option 2 to remove a student.\n7. Choose option 6 to quit the program.",
