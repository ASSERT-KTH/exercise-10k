  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to simulate a simple calculator. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as input and return the result of the respective operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Simple Calculator Program\n\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add(x, y):\n    print(\"Adding %d + %d\" % (x, y))\n    return x + y\n\n# Function to subtract two numbers\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    print(\"Subtracting %d - %d\" % (x, y))\n    return x - y\n\n# Function to multiply two numbers\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    print(\"Multiplying %d * %d\" % (x, y))\n    return x * y\n\n# Function to divide two numbers\ndef divide(x, y):\n    print(\"Dividing %d / %d\" % (x, y))\n    return x / y\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Let's do some math with just functions!\")\n\n    age = add(30, 5)\n    height = subtract(78, 4)\n    weight = multiply(90, 2)\n    iq = divide(100, 2)\n\n    print(\"Age: %d, Height: %d, Weight: %d, IQ: %d\" % (age, height, weight, iq))\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nI've followed the specifications carefully and included all the details mentioned. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
