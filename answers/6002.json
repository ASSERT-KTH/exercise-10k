  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and prints it to the screen",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that asks the user for their name and prints it to the screen:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Print the name to the screen\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\nLet me explain how this program works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get user input. In this case, it asks the user to \"Please enter your name: \" and stores the response in the `name` variable.\n2. The `print()` function is then used to print out a greeting message that includes the user's name.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g. `hello.py`) and run it from the command line by typing `python hello.py`. When you run the program, it will ask you for your name, and then print out a greeting message with your name.\n\nExample output:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John!\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see the same program in a different programming language.",
