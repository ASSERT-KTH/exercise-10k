  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the grade\ndef calculateGrade(score):\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        grade = \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80 and score < 90:\n        grade = \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70 and score < 80:\n        grade = \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60 and score < 70:\n        grade = \"D\"\n    else:\n        grade = \"F\"\n    return grade\n\n# Prompt the user for input\nscore = int(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(\"Grade:\", calculateGrade(score))\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, defining the `calculateGrade` function with the specified conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score. I've also used the `input` function to prompt the user for a score and converted it to an integer using the `int` function. Finally, I've called the `calculateGrade` function and printed the result using the `print` function.",
