  "answer": "**Replacing Substrings in a String**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python function that replaces all occurrences of a substring in a given string with another substring:\n\n```python\ndef replace_substring(original_string, old_substring, new_substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replaces all occurrences of old_substring in original_string with new_substring.\n\n    Args:\n        original_string (str): The original string to modify.\n        old_substring (str): The substring to replace.\n        new_substring (str): The substring to replace with.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The modified string with all occurrences of old_substring replaced.\n    \"\"\"\n    return original_string.replace(old_substring, new_substring)\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_string = \"Hello, world! Hello again!\"\nold_substring = \"Hello\"\nnew_substring = \"Goodbye\"\n\nmodified_string = replace_substring(original_string, old_substring, new_substring)\nprint(modified_string)  # Output: \"Goodbye, world! Goodbye again!\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `replace_substring` function takes three arguments: `original_string`, `old_substring`, and `new_substring`.\n2. It uses the built-in `replace` method of the string class to replace all occurrences of `old_substring` with `new_substring`.\n3. The modified string is returned as the result.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* This function is case-sensitive, so it will treat \"Hello\" and \"hello\" as different substrings.\n* If you want to perform a case-insensitive replacement, you can convert both the original string and the old substring to lowercase or uppercase before calling the `replace` method.\n* Be aware that this function replaces all occurrences of the old substring, including those that may be part of other words. If you want to replace only whole words, you may need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using regular expressions.",
