  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input, reverses the order of its elements, and then prints the modified array. The program should also calculate and print the average of the elements in the original array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n\n        int[] v = new int[n];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            v[i] = sc.nextInt();\n        }\n\n        int[] v2 = new int[n];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            v2[i] = v[n - i - 1];\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Reversed array: \");\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            System.out.print(v2[i] + \" \");\n        }\n\n        double media = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            media += v[i];\n        }\n        media /= n;\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nAverage: \" + media);\n\n        sc.close();\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that I've followed the specifications exactly, including the naming conventions and the order of operations. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
