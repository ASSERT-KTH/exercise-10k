  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses list comprehension to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\ndef difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nresult = difference(list1, list2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `difference` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input, and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in `list1` but not in `list2`. The function uses list comprehension to create the new list. The `if element not in list2` condition filters out elements that are present in `list2`. \n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `difference` function with two sample lists `list1` and `list2`, and prints the resulting list. \n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists, because the `in` operator has to iterate over the entire `list2` for each element in `list1`. For large input lists, a more efficient solution using sets can be used:\n\n```python\ndef difference(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) - set(list2))\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), making it more suitable for large input lists. However, it does not preserve the original order of the elements, and it may not work correctly if the input lists contain duplicate elements or unhashable elements (such as lists or dictionaries).",
