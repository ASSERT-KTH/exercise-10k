  "answer": "**Merging Two Arrays of Integers**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that merges two arrays of integers into a single array:\n\n```python\ndef merge_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two arrays of integers into a single array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array of integers.\n        arr2 (list): The second array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged array of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return arr1 + arr2\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nmerged_array = merge_arrays(arr1, arr2)\nprint(merged_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `merge_arrays` function takes two lists of integers as input.\n2. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two lists into a single list.\n3. The merged list is returned by the function.\n4. In the example usage, two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are defined and passed to the `merge_arrays` function.\n5. The merged array is printed to the console.\n\n**Alternative Solution**\n-------------------------\n\nIf you want to sort the merged array, you can use the `sorted` function:\n\n```python\ndef merge_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\narr2 = [6, 7, 3, 4, 10]\n\nmerged_array = merge_arrays(arr1, arr2)\nprint(merged_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThis solution sorts the merged array in ascending order. If you want to sort in descending order, you can pass the `reverse=True` argument to the `sorted` function.",
