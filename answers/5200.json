  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for the score of a game and then prints out the score in the format 'team_name score' (e.g. 'Team A 10').",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_score_from_user():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for the team name and score, then returns them.\n    \"\"\"\n    team_name = input(\"Please enter the team name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Please enter the score: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Score must be an integer.\")\n    return team_name, score\n\ndef print_score(team_name, score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the score in the format 'team_name score'.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"{team_name} {score}\")\n\ndef main():\n    team_name, score = get_score_from_user()\n    print_score(team_name, score)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_score_from_user` function asks the user to input the team name and score. It uses a `while` loop to ensure the score is an integer.\n* The `print_score` function takes the team name and score as arguments and prints them in the desired format.\n* The `main` function calls `get_score_from_user` and `print_score` to execute the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to input the team name and score. After you enter the information, it will print the score in the format 'team_name score'.\n\n```\nPlease enter the team name: Team A\nPlease enter the score: 10\nTeam A 10\n```",
