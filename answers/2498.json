  "answer": "**Validating Parentheses Sequences**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python program that uses a stack data structure to check if a given sequence of parentheses is valid.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_parentheses(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given sequence of parentheses is valid.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (str): The sequence of parentheses to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the sequence is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in mapping.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in mapping.keys():\n            if stack == [] or mapping[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n\n    return stack == []\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sequences = [\n        \"((()))\",  # Valid\n        \"(()\",     # Invalid\n        \"{[()]}\",\n        \"{[()]\",\n        \"{[]}\",\n        \"{[}\",\n    ]\n\n    for sequence in sequences:\n        print(f\"Sequence: {sequence}, Valid: {is_valid_parentheses(sequence)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. We define a function `is_valid_parentheses` that takes a sequence of parentheses as input.\n2. We create an empty stack to store the opening parentheses.\n3. We define a dictionary `mapping` that maps closing parentheses to their corresponding opening parentheses.\n4. We iterate over each character in the sequence.\n5. If the character is an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack.\n6. If the character is a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening parenthesis. If either condition is true, we return False.\n7. After iterating over the entire sequence, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, the sequence is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence. This is because we iterate over each character in the sequence once.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence. This is because we use a stack to store the opening parentheses, and in the worst case, the stack can grow to the size of the input sequence.",
