  "answer": "**Determining Primality**\n=========================\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n**Algorithm**\n-------------\n\nHere is a simple algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime or not:\n\n1. Check if the number is less than 2. If it is, then it's not prime.\n2. Check if the number is 2. If it is, then it's prime.\n3. Check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not prime.\n4. Iterate from 3 to the square root of the number, and check if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is, then it's not prime.\n5. If the number passes all these checks, then it's prime.\n\n**Example Code (Python)**\n-------------------------\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a given number is prime or not.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nfor num in numbers:\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is prime\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not prime\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's prime, and `False` otherwise.\n\n1. We first check if `n` is less than 2, in which case it's not prime.\n2. We then check if `n` is 2, which is the only even prime number.\n3. Next, we check if `n` is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not prime.\n4. We then iterate from 3 to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by any of these values. If it is, then it's not prime.\n5. If `n` passes all these checks, then it's prime.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(\u221an), where n is the input number. This is because we only need to check up to the square root of `n` to determine whether it's prime or not.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which means it uses constant space.",
