  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the first missing positive integer in an array of integers. The program should take an array of integers as input and output the first missing positive integer.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, A):\n        A = [0] + A\n        n = len(A)\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            while 1 <= A[i] <= n and A[A[i]] != A[i]:\n                A[A[i]], A[i] = A[i], A[A[i]]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if A[i] != i:\n                return i\n        return n\n\n# Test the solution\nsolution = Solution()\nA = [3, 4, -1, 1]\nprint(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 2\n\nA = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]\nprint(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 1\n\nA = [1, 2, 0]\nprint(solution.firstMissingPositive(A))  # Output: 3\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a method `firstMissingPositive` that takes an array `A` as input and returns the first missing positive integer. The method first modifies the input array `A` to include a leading 0, then iterates through the array to place each element at its correct position. Finally, it iterates through the array again to find the first missing positive integer. If no such integer is found, it returns the length of the array `A`. The code also includes some test cases to demonstrate the usage of the `firstMissingPositive` method.",
