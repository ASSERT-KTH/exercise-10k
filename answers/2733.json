  "answer": "**Symmetric Matrix Checker**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a given matrix is symmetric. A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., the matrix obtained by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n    matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrix is square (i.e., has the same number of rows and columns)\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n\n    # Calculate the transpose of the matrix\n    transpose = np.transpose(matrix)\n\n    # Check if the matrix is equal to its transpose\n    return np.allclose(matrix, transpose)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a symmetric matrix\n    symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]])\n\n    # Define a non-symmetric matrix\n    non_symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n\n    # Check if the matrices are symmetric\n    print(\"Is symmetric matrix symmetric?\", is_symmetric(symmetric_matrix))\n    print(\"Is non-symmetric matrix symmetric?\", is_symmetric(non_symmetric_matrix))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `is_symmetric` function takes a numpy array `matrix` as input and checks if it is symmetric.\n2. It first checks if the matrix is square (i.e., has the same number of rows and columns). If not, it returns `False`.\n3. It then calculates the transpose of the matrix using `np.transpose`.\n4. Finally, it checks if the matrix is equal to its transpose using `np.allclose`. If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Checking if a matrix is symmetric before performing certain operations that require symmetry.\n* Verifying the symmetry of a matrix generated by a numerical algorithm.\n* Identifying symmetric matrices in a collection of matrices.\n\nNote: This program uses the `numpy` library for matrix operations. If you don't have `numpy` installed, you can install it using `pip install numpy`.",
