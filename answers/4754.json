  "answer": "**Power Function Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Raises the base to the power of the exponent.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the result\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter `2` as the base and `3` as the exponent to calculate 2^3 = 8.\n*   Enter `4` as the base and `0.5` as the exponent to calculate 4^0.5 = 2.\n\n### How to Run\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `power.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program using Python (e.g., `python power.py`).\n4.  Follow the prompts to enter the base and exponent.\n5.  The program will print the result of the exponentiation.",
