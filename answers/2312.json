  "answer": "**Password Generator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random password based on user input for the length and character set.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport string\nimport secrets\n\ndef generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password based on user input.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password.\n        use_uppercase (bool): Whether to include uppercase letters.\n        use_numbers (bool): Whether to include numbers.\n        use_special_chars (bool): Whether to include special characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n    chars = string.ascii_lowercase\n    if use_uppercase:\n        chars += string.ascii_uppercase\n    if use_numbers:\n        chars += string.digits\n    if use_special_chars:\n        chars += string.punctuation\n\n    # Ensure the password includes at least one character from each selected character set\n    password = []\n    if use_uppercase:\n        password.append(secrets.choice(string.ascii_uppercase))\n    if use_numbers:\n        password.append(secrets.choice(string.digits))\n    if use_special_chars:\n        password.append(secrets.choice(string.punctuation))\n\n    # Fill the rest of the password length with random characters\n    for _ in range(length - len(password)):\n        password.append(secrets.choice(chars))\n\n    # Shuffle the password to avoid the first characters always being from specific character sets\n    secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle(password)\n\n    return ''.join(password)\n\ndef main():\n    length = int(input(\"Enter the password length: \"))\n    use_uppercase = input(\"Include uppercase letters? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n    use_numbers = input(\"Include numbers? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n    use_special_chars = input(\"Include special characters? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n\n    password = generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars)\n    print(\"Generated Password : \", password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the desired password length.\n3. Answer the prompts to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n4. The program will generate and display a random password based on your input.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `secrets` module is used to generate cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.\n* The `string` module is used to access various string constant which contains the ASCII characters of all cases.\n* The `generate_password` function ensures that the password includes at least one character from each selected character set.\n* The `main` function handles user input and displays the generated password.",
