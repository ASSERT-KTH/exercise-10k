  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to help you create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists. This function will utilize list comprehension to achieve the desired result. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists.\n\n    Args:\n        nested_list (list): A list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A single list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the nested list\n    for sublist in nested_list:\n        # For each sublist, iterate over each element in the sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # Append each element to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Alternatively, you can use list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way\ndef flatten_list_comprehension(nested_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input and returns a single list containing all elements from the sublists.\n\n    Args:\n        nested_list (list): A list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A single list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use list comprehension to create a new list containing all elements from the sublists\n    return [element for sublist in nested_list for element in sublist]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `flatten_list` function iterates over each sublist in the `nested_list` using a nested loop structure, appending each element to the `result` list.\n* The `flatten_list_comprehension` function achieves the same result using list comprehension, creating a new list containing all elements from the sublists in a more concise manner.\n* Both functions take a `nested_list` as input and return a single list containing all elements from the sublists.\n* The list comprehension approach in `flatten_list_comprehension` is generally more efficient and readable for this type of operation.",
