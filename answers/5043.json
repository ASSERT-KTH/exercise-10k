  "answer": "**Quotient and Remainder Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input, `dividend` and `divisor`, and returns their quotient and remainder.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    - divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n    - tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate quotient and remainder\n        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n        # Print results\n        print(f\"Quotient: {quotient}\")\n        print(f\"Remainder: {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function takes two integers as input and returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n2. The function checks if the divisor is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if it is.\n3. The quotient is calculated using the `//` operator, which performs integer division.\n4. The remainder is calculated using the `%` operator, which returns the remainder of the division.\n5. The `main` function gets user input for the dividend and divisor, calls the `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function, and prints the results.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor.\n2. The program will output:\n```\nQuotient: 3\nRemainder: 2\n```",
