  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Program**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two input numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    \n    # Calculate and print the LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 15`\nOutput: `The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60`\n* Input: `num1 = 24`, `num2 = 30`\nOutput: `The least common multiple of 24 and 30 is: 120`\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and calculates their LCM using the GCD method.\n2. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the GCD of the two numbers.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n4. The `main` function gets user input, calculates the LCM, and prints the result.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use a custom GCD implementation instead.",
