  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a list of factorials from 1 to the given number.",
  "answer": "### Factorial Function\n#### Description\nThis function calculates and returns a list of factorials from 1 to the given number.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_factorials(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate and return a list of factorials from 1 to the given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit for calculating factorials.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of factorials from 1 to the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    factorials = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the factorial using the math library\n        factorial = math.factorial(i)\n        factorials.append(factorial)\n    return factorials\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    result = calculate_factorials(num)\n    print(f\"Factorials from 1 to {num}: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `calculate_factorials` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `factorials` to store the calculated factorials.\n3. It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, it calculates the factorial of the current number `i` using the `math.factorial` function.\n5. The calculated factorial is appended to the `factorials` list.\n6. After the loop, the function returns the `factorials` list.\n\n#### Example Output\nFor the input `5`, the output will be:\n```\nFactorials from 1 to 5: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]\n```",
