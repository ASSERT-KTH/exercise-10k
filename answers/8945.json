  "answer": "### Variable Operations Example\n#### Overview\n\nThis example demonstrates basic operations on a variable, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The result of each operation is printed to the console.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a variable\nx = 10\n\n# Perform operations on the variable\nprint(\"Initial value of x:\", x)\n\n# Addition\nx += 5\nprint(\"Value of x after addition:\", x)\n\n# Subtraction\nx -= 3\nprint(\"Value of x after subtraction:\", x)\n\n# Multiplication\nx *= 2\nprint(\"Value of x after multiplication:\", x)\n\n# Division\nx /= 2\nprint(\"Value of x after division:\", x)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We start by defining a variable `x` with the initial value of 10.\n2. We perform the following operations on `x`:\n\t* Addition: `x += 5` adds 5 to the current value of `x`.\n\t* Subtraction: `x -= 3` subtracts 3 from the current value of `x`.\n\t* Multiplication: `x *= 2` multiplies the current value of `x` by 2.\n\t* Division: `x /= 2` divides the current value of `x` by 2.\n3. After each operation, we print the updated value of `x`.\n\n#### Output\n\n```\nInitial value of x: 10\nValue of x after addition: 15\nValue of x after subtraction: 12\nValue of x after multiplication: 24\nValue of x after division: 12.0\n```\n\nNote that the division operation results in a floating-point number, even if the result is a whole number. This is because the `/` operator in Python performs \"true division\" and returns a float result. If you want to perform integer division, you can use the `//` operator instead.",
