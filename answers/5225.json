  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints 'Even' if all numbers in the array are even, and 'Odd' if at least one number is odd.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the provided specification:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            print(\"Odd\")\n            return\n    print(\"Even\")\n\nt = 1\nfor _ in range(t):\n    solve()\n```\n\nThis code will work as specified, reading input from standard input and printing the result to standard output. It assumes that the input is well-formed and can be parsed correctly. If the input may be malformed, additional error handling should be added.",
