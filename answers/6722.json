  "answer": "**Character Reader and Writer Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program reads and writes individual characters from standard input to standard output.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef read_and_write_characters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads and writes individual characters from standard input to standard output.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        char = input(\"Enter a character (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        \n        # Check if user wants to quit\n        if char.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        \n        # Write the character to standard output\n        print(f\"You entered: {char}\")\n\ndef main():\n    read_and_write_characters()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `read_and_write_characters` function runs in an infinite loop, reading characters from standard input.\n2. The user is prompted to enter a character. If the user enters 'q', the program exits the loop and terminates.\n3. The entered character is written to standard output using `print`.\n4. The `main` function calls `read_and_write_characters` to start the program.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and enter a single character (e.g., 'a'). The program will print \"You entered: a\".\n* Run the program and enter 'q' to quit the program.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* This program uses Python 3.x syntax.\n* The `input` function reads a line from standard input, and the `print` function writes to standard output.\n* The program does not perform any error checking on the input character. If you need to handle invalid input, you can add additional checks and error handling.",
