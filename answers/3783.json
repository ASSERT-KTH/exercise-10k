  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings. It iterates through the characters of the first string and checks if the same character is present in the same position in all other strings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    strs = [\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strs))  # Output: \"fl\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list, as the longest common prefix cannot be longer than this string.\n3. Iterate through each character in the shortest string.\n4. For each character, check if the same character is present in the same position in all other strings.\n5. If a mismatch is found, return the common prefix up to the current position.\n6. If no mismatch is found after iterating through all characters, return the entire shortest string as the common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.",
