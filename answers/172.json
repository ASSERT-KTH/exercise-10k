  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python to demonstrate static typing. However, please note that Python is a dynamically-typed language, and it does not support static typing in the classical sense. But we can use type hints and the mypy tool to achieve static typing.\n\n```python\n# Define a function with static typing\ndef greeting(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Return a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n# Define a function with static typing\ndef add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n# Test the functions\nprint(greeting(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\nprint(add_numbers(5, 7))  # Output: 12\n\n# Try to pass incorrect types to the functions\ntry:\n    print(greeting(123))\nexcept TypeError:\n    print(\"Error: name must be a string\")\n\ntry:\n    print(add_numbers(\"five\", 7))\nexcept TypeError:\n    print(\"Error: a and b must be integers\")\n```\n\nHowever, when you run this code, Python will not throw any errors for passing incorrect types to the functions because Python is dynamically-typed. \n\nTo achieve static typing in Python, you can use the mypy tool, which is a static type checker for Python. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. Install mypy: `pip install mypy`\n2. Save the above code in a file, for example, `static_typing.py`\n3. Run the mypy tool: `mypy static_typing.py`\n\nmypy will then check the types in your code and report any type errors. If you pass incorrect types to the functions, mypy will throw an error.\n\nFor example, if you modify the code to pass incorrect types to the functions:\n\n```python\nprint(greeting(123))\nprint(add_numbers(\"five\", 7))\n```\n\nAnd then run mypy, it will report the following errors:\n\n```\nstatic_typing.py:14: error: Argument 1 to \"greeting\" has incompatible type \"int\"; expected \"str\"\nstatic_typing.py:15: error: Argument 1 to \"add_numbers\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"int\"\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how mypy can be used to achieve static typing in Python.",
