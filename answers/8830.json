  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program written in Python that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their name and returns it.\"\"\"\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    return user_name\n\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message with the provided name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! It's nice to meet you.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's name and prints out a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(user_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_name` function prompts the user to enter their name using the built-in `input` function and returns the provided name.\n2. The `print_greeting` function takes a name as an argument and prints out a greeting message using an f-string to insert the name into the message.\n3. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It calls `get_user_name` to get the user's name and then calls `print_greeting` with the provided name.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John! It's nice to meet you.\n```",
