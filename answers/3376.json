  "answer": "**Most Frequent Element in a List**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses a for loop to find the most frequent element in a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef most_frequent_element(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most frequent element in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The most frequent element in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency = {}\n    max_frequency = 0\n    most_frequent = None\n\n    # Count the frequency of each element\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num in frequency:\n            frequency[num] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[num] = 1\n\n        # Update the most frequent element if necessary\n        if frequency[num] > max_frequency:\n            max_frequency = frequency[num]\n            most_frequent = num\n\n    return most_frequent\n\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(most_frequent_element(numbers))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each element in the list.\n2. We initialize `max_frequency` to 0 and `most_frequent` to None, which will store the maximum frequency and the most frequent element, respectively.\n3. We iterate over the list using a for loop. For each element:\n   * If the element is already in the `frequency` dictionary, we increment its count by 1.\n   * If the element is not in the `frequency` dictionary, we add it with a count of 1.\n   * We update `max_frequency` and `most_frequent` if the current element's frequency is greater than the current `max_frequency`.\n4. Finally, we return the most frequent element.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we iterate over the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), since in the worst case, we might need to store every element in the `frequency` dictionary.",
