  "answer": "**Credit Card Validator Program**\n====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program validates a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm, which is a widely used method for validating credit card numbers. The program uses if/else statements to check the validity of the credit card number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(digit) for digit in card_number.replace(\" \", \"\")]\n\n    # Check if the card number has a valid length\n    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 16:\n        return False\n\n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n\n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n\n    # Check if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10\n    if sum(card_number) % 10 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    card_number = input(\"Enter a credit card number: \")\n    if validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n        print(\"The credit card number is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The credit card number is not valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a valid credit card number (e.g., 4111111111111111) to see the program return \"The credit card number is valid.\"\n*   Enter an invalid credit card number (e.g., 1234567890123456) to see the program return \"The credit card number is not valid.\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The program first checks if the card number has a valid length (between 13 and 16 digits).\n2.  It then reverses the card number and doubles every second digit.\n3.  If the doubled digit is greater than 9, it subtracts 9 from the digit.\n4.  Finally, it checks if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10. If it is, the credit card number is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.\n\nNote: This program uses a simplified version of the Luhn algorithm and does not check for specific credit card types (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) or other validation rules.",
