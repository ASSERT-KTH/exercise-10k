  "prompt": "Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program should ask the user to choose the operation and then input the two numbers. It should then display the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that satisfies the given specifications:\n```\n# Introduction\nprint(\"Welcome to the basic arithmetic operations program!\")\n\n# Function Definitions\ndef addition(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtraction(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiplication(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef division(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero!\"\n    else:\n        return a / b\n\n# User Input\noperation = input(\"Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Operation Execution\nif operation == \"+\":\n    print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {addition(num1, num2)}\")\nelif operation == \"-\":\n    print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtraction(num1, num2)}\")\nelif operation == \"*\":\n    print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiplication(num1, num2)}\")\nelif operation == \"/\":\n    result = division(num1, num2)\n    if isinstance(result, str):\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid operation. Please try again.\")\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic operation functions, asks the user for input, and executes the chosen operation. It also handles division by zero and invalid operations.",
