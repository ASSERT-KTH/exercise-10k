  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that scrambles a given word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles a given word.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    word (str): The word to be scrambled.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    The main function of the program.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nUnscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    \n    if user_answer.lower() == word.lower():\n        print(\"Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed\", word)\n    else:\n        print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the program:\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list using `random.shuffle`, and then joins the list back into a string.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a word, scrambles the word using the `scramble_word` function, and then prompts the user to unscramble the word.\n3. The program checks if the user's answer matches the original word (case-insensitive), and prints a success or failure message accordingly.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEnter a word: hello\nUnscramble the word: lleoh\nEnter your answer: hello\nCorrect! The unscrambled word is indeed hello\n```",
