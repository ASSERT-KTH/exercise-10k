  "answer": "**City Statistics Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a dictionary where the keys are names of cities and the values are dictionaries containing information about the city, calculate and print the average population and area of all the cities in the dictionary.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_city_stats(city_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average population and area of all cities in the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        city_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are city names and the values are dictionaries containing city information.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the average population and area of all cities.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_population = 0\n    total_area = 0\n    city_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each city in the dictionary\n    for city, info in city_dict.items():\n        # Check if the city has population and area information\n        if 'population' in info and 'area' in info:\n            total_population += info['population']\n            total_area += info['area']\n            city_count += 1\n\n    # Check if there are any cities with population and area information\n    if city_count == 0:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Calculate the average population and area\n    average_population = total_population / city_count\n    average_area = total_area / city_count\n\n    return average_population, average_area\n\n\ndef print_average_city_stats(city_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate and print the average population and area of all cities in the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        city_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are city names and the values are dictionaries containing city information.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_population, average_area = calculate_average_city_stats(city_dict)\n\n    if average_population is None or average_area is None:\n        print(\"No cities with population and area information found.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Average population: {average_population:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Average area: {average_area:.2f}\")\n\n\n# Example usage\ncity_dict = {\n    \"New York\": {\"population\": 8405837, \"area\": 302.6, \"climate\": \"Humid subtropical\"},\n    \"Los Angeles\": {\"population\": 3990456, \"area\": 502.7, \"climate\": \"Mediterranean\"},\n    \"Chicago\": {\"population\": 2705994, \"area\": 234.2, \"climate\": \"Humid continental\"},\n    \"Houston\": {\"population\": 2319781, \"area\": 627.7, \"climate\": \"Humid subtropical\"},\n}\n\nprint_average_city_stats(city_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_average_city_stats` to calculate the average population and area of all cities in the dictionary.\n2. Initialize variables to store the total population, total area, and city count.\n3. Iterate over each city in the dictionary and check if it has population and area information.\n4. If a city has the required information, add its population and area to the total and increment the city count.\n5. Calculate the average population and area by dividing the total population and area by the city count.\n6. Define a function `print_average_city_stats` to print the average population and area of all cities in the dictionary.\n7. Call the `calculate_average_city_stats` function and print the results.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `print_average_city_stats` function to calculate and print the average population and area of a dictionary of cities. The output will be the average population and area of the cities in the dictionary, rounded to two decimal places.",
