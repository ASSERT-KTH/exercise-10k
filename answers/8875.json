  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their remainder.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate remainder\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Take input from user\n        dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n        # Calculate remainder\n        remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n        # Print remainder\n        print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n# Run the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. **Input**: The program will first ask the user to enter two numbers: the dividend (the number being divided) and the divisor (the number by which we are dividing).\n2. **Error Handling**: Before calculating the remainder, the program checks if the divisor is zero. If it is, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.\n3. **Calculation**: If the divisor is not zero, the program calculates the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints out the remainder.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nIf you enter `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output: `The remainder of 17.0 divided by 5.0 is 2.0` because 17 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2.",
