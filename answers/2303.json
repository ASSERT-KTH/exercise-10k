  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate and print the square root of a given number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program to calculate and print the square root of a given number:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    if number < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Square root of negative number is not a real number.\")\n    else:\n        square_root = math.sqrt(number)\n        print(\"The square root of\", number, \"is\", square_root)\n\n# Test the function\nnumber = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncalculate_square_root(number)\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1.  We import the `math` module, which provides the `sqrt` function for calculating the square root of a number.\n2.  We define a function `calculate_square_root` that takes a number as input.\n3.  Inside the function, we check if the number is negative. If it is, we print an error message because the square root of a negative number is not a real number.\n4.  If the number is non-negative, we calculate its square root using `math.sqrt` and print the result.\n5.  Finally, we test the function by asking the user to enter a number and passing it to the `calculate_square_root` function.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a number when prompted, and it will print the square root of that number.",
