  "answer": "**Hamming Distance Function**\n==========================\n\nThe Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Hamming distance between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The Hamming distance between the two strings.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the strings are not of equal length.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Strings must be of equal length\")\n\n    return sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"abcdef\"\n    str2 = \"abcxyz\"\n    print(f\"Hamming distance between '{str1}' and '{str2}': {hamming_distance(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input strings `str1` and `str2` have the same length. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n2. Use the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of both strings in parallel.\n3. Use a generator expression to compare each pair of characters. If the characters are different (`c1 != c2`), count it as 1.\n4. Sum up the counts to get the total Hamming distance.\n5. Return the Hamming distance.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input strings only contain characters (not other types of data). If you need to handle other types of data, you may need to modify the function accordingly.",
