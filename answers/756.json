  "answer": "**Chatbot Program**\n======================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a chatbot in Python that responds to basic user input.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Python 3.6+\n* `random` library (built-in)\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary of chatbot responses\nresponses = {\n    'hello': ['Hi there!', 'Hello!', 'Hey!'],\n    'how are you': ['I\\'m doing great, thanks!', 'I\\'m good, thanks for asking!', 'I\\'m just a chatbot, I don\\'t have feelings, but thanks for asking!'],\n    'what is your purpose': ['I\\'m here to assist and chat with you!', 'My purpose is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability.', 'I\\'m a simple chatbot, my purpose is to learn and improve my language skills.'],\n    'default': ['I didn\\'t quite understand that.', 'Can you please rephrase?', 'Sorry, I\\'m not sure I understand what you mean.']\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a response to the user's input based on a dictionary of predefined responses.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return random.choice(responses[key])\n    return random.choice(responses['default'])\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", get_response(user_input))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `responses` that maps user input to a list of possible chatbot responses.\n2. The `get_response` function takes user input, converts it to lowercase, and checks if it matches any of the keys in the `responses` dictionary. If a match is found, it returns a random response from the corresponding list. If no match is found, it returns a random response from the 'default' list.\n3. The `main` function runs a loop that prompts the user for input, checks if the input is 'quit', and if not, prints the chatbot's response.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* User: `hello`\nChatbot: `Hi there!`\n* User: `how are you`\nChatbot: `I'm doing great, thanks!`\n* User: `what is your purpose`\nChatbot: `I'm here to assist and chat with you!`\n* User: `foo bar`\nChatbot: `I didn't quite understand that.`\n\nNote: This is a very basic chatbot implementation and can be improved with more advanced natural language processing techniques and a larger dataset of responses.",
