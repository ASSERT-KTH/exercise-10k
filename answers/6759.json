  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nHere is a simple Python program to create a number guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n* Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n* Try guessing a number outside the range of 1 to 100 to see an error message.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint`.\n2. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low, and gives feedback accordingly.\n4. The program keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it when the user finds the correct number.\n5. The program allows the user to quit by typing \"quit\".",
