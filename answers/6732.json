  "answer": "**Data Transformation Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program takes in a list of numbers and applies several transformation functions to it. The transformations include:\n\n* Doubling each number\n* Squaring each number\n* Increasing each number by a specified amount\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef double_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Double each number in the list\"\"\"\n    return [n * 2 for n in numbers]\n\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Square each number in the list\"\"\"\n    return [n ** 2 for n in numbers]\n\ndef increase_numbers(numbers, amount):\n    \"\"\"Increase each number in the list by a specified amount\"\"\"\n    return [n + amount for n in numbers]\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(\"Original numbers:\", numbers)\n\n    doubled_numbers = double_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Doubled numbers:\", doubled_numbers)\n\n    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Squared numbers:\", squared_numbers)\n\n    increased_numbers = increase_numbers(numbers, 5)\n    print(\"Increased numbers:\", increased_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines three functions: `double_numbers`, `square_numbers`, and `increase_numbers`.\n2. Each function takes in a list of numbers and applies the corresponding transformation.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions by applying them to a sample list of numbers.\n4. The results of each transformation are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nOriginal numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nDoubled numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nSquared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nIncreased numbers: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the `main` function to accept user input or read from a file instead of using a hardcoded list of numbers.\n* You can add more transformation functions as needed.\n* You can use this program as a starting point for more complex data transformation tasks.",
