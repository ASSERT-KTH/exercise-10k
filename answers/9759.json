  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial amount of money\n        rate (float): Annual interest rate (in decimal)\n        time (int): Time period in years\n        frequency (int): Compounding frequency per year\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n    frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency per year (e.g., 1 for annually, 12 for monthly): \"))\n\n    interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes four arguments:\n\t* `principal`: The initial amount of money.\n\t* `rate`: The annual interest rate (in decimal).\n\t* `time`: The time period in years.\n\t* `frequency`: The compounding frequency per year.\n2. The function uses the formula for compound interest: `A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where:\n\t* `A` is the amount of money accumulated after `n` years, including interest.\n\t* `P` is the principal amount.\n\t* `r` is the annual interest rate (in decimal).\n\t* `n` is the compounding frequency per year.\n\t* `t` is the time period in years.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n4. It then calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function with the user-input values and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, a time period of 5 years, and a compounding frequency of 12 (monthly):\n\t* Input: `principal = 1000`, `rate = 5`, `time = 5`, `frequency = 12`\n\t* Output: `The compound interest is: $1,276.28`\n2. Calculate the compound interest for a principal amount of $5,000, an annual interest rate of 3%, a time period of 10 years, and a compounding frequency of 1 (annually):\n\t* Input: `principal = 5000`, `rate = 3`, `time = 10`, `frequency = 1`\n\t* Output: `The compound interest is: $6,717.10`",
