  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs a binary search on a given list of numbers using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a binary search on a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of numbers.\n        target (int): The number to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target number if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the low and high pointers\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    # Continue the search while the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer\n    while low <= high:\n        # Calculate the mid index\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # If the target is found at the mid index, return the mid index\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n\n        # If the target is less than the mid element, update the high pointer\n        elif arr[mid] > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n        # If the target is greater than the mid element, update the low pointer\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    # If the target is not found, return -1\n    return -1\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sorted list of numbers\n    numbers = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n\n    # Define the target number to search for\n    target_number = 23\n\n    # Perform the binary search\n    result = binary_search(numbers, target_number)\n\n    # Print the result\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"The target number {target_number} is found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The target number {target_number} is not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Binary Search Function:** The `binary_search` function takes a sorted list `arr` and a target number `target` as input. It returns the index of the target number if found, and -1 otherwise.\n2.  **Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the list, respectively.\n3.  **While Loop:** The while loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.\n4.  **Mid Index Calculation:** Calculate the mid index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n5.  **Comparison and Updates:** Compare the target number with the middle element. If they match, return the mid index. If the target is less than the mid element, update `high` to `mid - 1`. If the target is greater, update `low` to `mid + 1`.\n6.  **Result:** If the target is not found after the loop ends, return -1 to indicate that the target is not in the list.\n7.  **Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to call the `binary_search` function with a sorted list of numbers and a target number. It prints the result, indicating whether the target number is found and its index if found.",
