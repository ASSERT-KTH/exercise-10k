  "answer": "Here's a Python solution to delete a specific element from an array. This program defines a function called `delete_element` that takes an array and a target element as input, removes the first occurrence of the target element, and returns the updated array.\n\n```python\ndef delete_element(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes the first occurrence of a target element from an array.\n\n    Args:\n    array (list): The input array.\n    target: The element to be deleted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The updated array after deletion.\n    \"\"\"\n    if target in array:\n        array.remove(target)\n    return array\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\ntarget = 2\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Target element:\", target)\nprint(\"Updated array:\", delete_element(array, target))\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\nTarget element: 2\nUpdated array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\n```\n\nAs you can see, the first occurrence of the target element `2` has been removed from the array.\n\n**Note:** If the target element is not found in the array, the `remove` method will raise a `ValueError`. To avoid this, the code checks if the target element is in the array before attempting to remove it.\n\nIf you want to delete all occurrences of the target element, you can use a list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef delete_all_occurrences(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes all occurrences of a target element from an array.\n\n    Args:\n    array (list): The input array.\n    target: The element to be deleted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The updated array after deletion.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in array if element != target]\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\ntarget = 2\nprint(\"Original array:\", array)\nprint(\"Target element:\", target)\nprint(\"Updated array:\", delete_all_occurrences(array, target))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nOriginal array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\nTarget element: 2\nUpdated array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNow, all occurrences of the target element `2` have been removed from the array.",
