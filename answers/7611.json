  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Define the range of numbers to print\nstart = 1\nend = 10\n\n# Use a for loop to print the numbers\nfor i in range(start, end + 1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define the start and end of the range using variables `start` and `end`.\n*   The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `start` up to, but not including, `end + 1`. The `+ 1` is necessary because the `range()` function in Python is exclusive of the end value.\n*   Inside the for loop, we print each number `i` in the sequence.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to see the output.\n\n**Alternative Solution:**\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more concise version of the code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code achieves the same result as the previous example but combines the range definition and loop into a single line.",
