  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the longest common prefix of a list of strings. It uses a simple iterative approach to compare the characters of each string at the same position.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list[str]): List of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other_str in strs:\n            if other_str[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    strs = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strs))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. Iterate over the characters of the shortest string.\n4. For each character, iterate over the other strings in the list. If any string has a different character at the same position, return the prefix up to the current position.\n5. If all strings have the same character at the current position, continue to the next position.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the list. This is because we iterate over each character of the shortest string and compare it with the corresponding character of each other string.",
