  "prompt": "Create a program that keeps track of the top scores in a game and prints out the leaderboard.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses a dictionary to store player names and their corresponding scores. The program allows you to add scores, view the current leaderboard, and reset the leaderboard.\n\n```python\nclass Leaderboard:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.scores = {}\n\n    def add_score(self, name, score):\n        \"\"\"Add a score to the leaderboard.\"\"\"\n        if name in self.scores:\n            if score > self.scores[name]:\n                self.scores[name] = score\n        else:\n            self.scores[name] = score\n\n    def view_leaderboard(self):\n        \"\"\"Print out the current leaderboard.\"\"\"\n        sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        print(\"Leaderboard:\")\n        for i, (name, score) in enumerate(sorted_scores):\n            print(f\"{i+1}. {name}: {score}\")\n\n    def reset_leaderboard(self):\n        \"\"\"Reset the leaderboard.\"\"\"\n        self.scores = {}\n\n\ndef main():\n    leaderboard = Leaderboard()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Add score\")\n        print(\"2. View leaderboard\")\n        print(\"3. Reset leaderboard\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter player name: \")\n            score = int(input(\"Enter player score: \"))\n            leaderboard.add_score(name, score)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            leaderboard.view_leaderboard()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            leaderboard.reset_leaderboard()\n            print(\"Leaderboard has been reset.\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `Leaderboard` class has three methods:\n    *   `add_score(name, score)`: Adds a score to the leaderboard or updates an existing score if the new score is higher.\n    *   `view_leaderboard()`: Prints out the current leaderboard, sorted by score in descending order.\n    *   `reset_leaderboard()`: Resets the leaderboard by clearing all scores.\n*   The `main()` function provides a simple text-based interface to interact with the leaderboard. It repeatedly prompts the user for input until they choose to quit.\n*   The program uses a dictionary (`self.scores`) to store player names and their corresponding scores, allowing for efficient lookup and update of scores.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to add a score. Enter a player name and score.\n3.  Choose option 2 to view the leaderboard. The player's score should be displayed.\n4.  Choose option 1 again to add another score. Enter a different player name and score.\n5.  Choose option 2 to view the updated leaderboard. Both players' scores should be displayed, sorted by score in descending order.\n6.  Choose option 3 to reset the leaderboard.\n7.  Choose option 2 to view the leaderboard again. The leaderboard should be empty.\n8.  Choose option 4 to quit the program.",
