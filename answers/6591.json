  "prompt": "Write a program to find the mode of all numbers in an array.",
  "answer": "**Mode Finder Program**\n=========================\n\nThis program calculates the mode of all numbers in a given array. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the array.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_mode(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the mode of all numbers in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes. If there are multiple modes, all of them are returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number in the array\n    frequency = Counter(array)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = find_mode(array)\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_mode` function takes an array as input and uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the array.\n2. It then finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the values of the `frequency` dictionary.\n3. The function uses a list comprehension to find all numbers with the maximum frequency, which are the modes of the array.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `find_mode` function with an example array.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Finding the mode of a list of exam scores to determine the most common score.\n* Identifying the most popular product in a list of customer purchases.\n* Determining the most frequent value in a dataset of sensor readings.\n\nNote: If there are multiple modes, this program will return all of them. If you only want to return one mode, you can modify the program to return the smallest or largest mode.",
