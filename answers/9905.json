  "answer": "**Mortgage Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the monthly payment for a mortgage based on the principal, interest rate, and term.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mortgage_payment(principal, annual_interest_rate, term_in_years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly payment for a mortgage.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount borrowed.\n        annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        term_in_years (int): The term of the mortgage in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert annual interest rate to monthly interest rate\n    monthly_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 12\n\n    # Calculate the number of monthly payments\n    num_payments = term_in_years * 12\n\n    # Calculate the monthly payment\n    monthly_payment = (principal * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** num_payments) / (\n                (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** num_payments - 1)\n\n    return monthly_payment\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    principal = 200000  # Initial amount borrowed\n    annual_interest_rate = 0.04  # Annual interest rate as a decimal\n    term_in_years = 30  # Term of the mortgage in years\n\n    monthly_payment = calculate_mortgage_payment(principal, annual_interest_rate, term_in_years)\n\n    print(f\"Monthly payment: ${monthly_payment:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses the formula for calculating the monthly payment for a mortgage:\n\nM = P [ i (1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]\n\nWhere:\n- M = monthly payment\n- P = principal (initial amount borrowed)\n- i = monthly interest rate\n- n = number of monthly payments\n\nThe program defines a function `calculate_mortgage_payment` that takes the principal, annual interest rate, and term as input, and returns the monthly payment amount. The `main` function provides an example usage of this function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the monthly payment for a $200,000 mortgage with an annual interest rate of 4% and a term of 30 years.\n* Calculate the monthly payment for a $150,000 mortgage with an annual interest rate of 3.5% and a term of 20 years.\n\nNote: This program assumes a fixed interest rate and does not account for other costs associated with a mortgage, such as property taxes and insurance.",
