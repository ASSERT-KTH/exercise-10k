  "answer": "**Maximum Element in List with Condition**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that finds the maximum element in a list that meets a specific condition (numbers greater than 3) using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_element(lst, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the maximum element in a list that meets a specific condition.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list of numbers.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if the condition is met, False otherwise.\n\n    Returns:\n        The maximum element in the list that meets the condition, or None if no such element exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_element = None\n    for element in lst:\n        if condition(element):\n            if max_element is None or element > max_element:\n                max_element = element\n    return max_element\n\n# Define the condition function\ndef greater_than_3(num):\n    return num > 3\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9]\nmax_num = find_max_element(numbers, greater_than_3)\n\nif max_num is not None:\n    print(f\"The maximum element greater than 3 is: {max_num}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No element greater than 3 found in the list.\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `find_max_element` function takes a list `lst` and a condition function `condition` as input.\n2. It initializes `max_element` to `None`.\n3. It iterates over each element in the list using a for loop.\n4. For each element, it checks if the condition is met by calling the `condition` function.\n5. If the condition is met and `max_element` is `None` or the current element is greater than `max_element`, it updates `max_element` to the current element.\n6. Finally, it returns `max_element`, which is the maximum element in the list that meets the condition, or `None` if no such element exists.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nThe maximum element greater than 3 is: 9\n```",
