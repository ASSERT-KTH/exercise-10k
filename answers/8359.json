  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps. This function will take two parameters: the array to be rotated and the number of steps to rotate, and return the rotated array. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_array(array, steps):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array (list): The array to be rotated.\n    steps (int): The number of steps to rotate.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the array is empty, in which case we return the original array\n    if not array:\n        return array\n\n    # Calculate the effective number of steps, in case the number of steps is greater than the length of the array\n    # This is done by finding the remainder of the division of the number of steps by the length of the array\n    effective_steps = steps % len(array)\n    \n    # If the effective number of steps is 0, return the original array\n    if effective_steps == 0:\n        return array\n    \n    # Split the array into two parts: the part that will be moved to the beginning and the part that will stay at the end\n    # The part that will be moved to the beginning starts from the end of the array and has a length of 'effective_steps'\n    part_to_move = array[-effective_steps:]\n    \n    # The part that will stay at the end starts from the beginning of the array and has a length of 'len(array) - effective_steps'\n    part_to_stay = array[:-effective_steps]\n    \n    # Combine the two parts in reverse order to get the rotated array\n    rotated_array = part_to_move + part_to_stay\n    \n    # Return the rotated array\n    return rotated_array\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `rotate_array` first checks if the input `array` is empty. If it is, the function returns the original array as there's nothing to rotate.\n* It then calculates the `effective_steps` by finding the remainder of the division of `steps` by the length of the `array`. This handles cases where `steps` is greater than the length of the `array`.\n* The function splits the `array` into two parts: `part_to_move` and `part_to_stay`. `part_to_move` is the part of the `array` that will be moved to the beginning, and `part_to_stay` is the part that will stay at the end.\n* Finally, it combines `part_to_move` and `part_to_stay` in reverse order to get the `rotated_array`, which is then returned as the result.",
