The `calculate_quadratic_solutions` function takes in the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of the quadratic equation and calculates the determinant `b^2 - 4ac`.\n2. Based on the value of the determinant, the function determines the nature of the roots:\n\t* If the determinant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots.\n\t* If the determinant is zero, the equation has one repeated real root.\n\t* If the determinant is negative, the equation has two complex roots.\n3. The function returns the solutions as a tuple.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n5. The `calculate_quadratic_solutions` function is called with the user-input coefficients, and the solutions are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Solve the quadratic equation `x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 4`\n\t+ Output: `x = -2`\n* Solve the quadratic equation `x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 1`, `b = -3`, `c = 2`\n\t+ Output: `x1 = 2`, `x2 = 1`\n* Solve the quadratic equation `x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0`:\n\t+ Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 5`\n\t+ Output: `x1 = -1 + 2j`, `x2 = -1 - 2j` (complex roots)",
