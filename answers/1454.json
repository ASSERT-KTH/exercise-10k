  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the cost and markup percentage as input and outputs the selling price.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the selling price based on the cost and markup percentage:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the selling price based on the cost and markup percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        cost (float): The cost of the item.\n        markup_percentage (float): The markup percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The selling price.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the markup amount\n    markup_amount = (cost * markup_percentage) / 100\n\n    # Calculate the selling price\n    selling_price = cost + markup_amount\n\n    return selling_price\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the cost and markup percentage from the user\n    cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost: $\"))\n    markup_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the markup percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the selling price\n    selling_price = calculate_selling_price(cost, markup_percentage)\n\n    # Print the selling price\n    print(f\"The selling price is: ${selling_price:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts:\n\n1. Enter the cost when prompted (e.g., `100`).\n2. Enter the markup percentage when prompted (e.g., `20`).\n3. The program will output the selling price based on the given cost and markup percentage.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_selling_price` that takes the cost and markup percentage as arguments.\n2. The function calculates the markup amount by multiplying the cost by the markup percentage and dividing by 100.\n3. The function calculates the selling price by adding the markup amount to the cost.\n4. The `main` function gets the cost and markup percentage from the user, calls the `calculate_selling_price` function, and prints the result.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the markup percentage is a decimal value (e.g., 20 for 20%). If you want to enter the markup percentage as a fraction (e.g., 0.20 for 20%), you can modify the program accordingly.",
