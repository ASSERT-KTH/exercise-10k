  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both lists.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef common_elements(a, b):\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):\n        if a[i] == b[j]:\n            result.append(a[i])\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        elif a[i] < b[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(common_elements(a, b))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
