  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    while num2 != 0:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return abs(num1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly applies the formula `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)` until `b` is 0.\n3. The `while` loop continues until `num2` is 0, at which point `num1` is the GCD.\n4. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_gcd` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18: `calculate_gcd(48, 18)` returns 6.\n* Calculate the GCD of -24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(-24, 30)` returns 6.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This implementation assumes the input numbers are integers. If you need to handle floating-point numbers, you may need to modify the algorithm or use a different approach.\n* The Euclidean algorithm has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it efficient for large numbers.",
