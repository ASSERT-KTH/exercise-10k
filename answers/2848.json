  "answer": "### Filtering a Dictionary\n#### Function Description\n\nThe function `filter_dictionary` filters a dictionary based on a given condition. It takes in a dictionary, a condition function, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet the condition.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_dictionary(dictionary, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a dictionary based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in dictionary.items() if condition(key, value)}\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a dictionary\n    dictionary = {\n        \"a\": 1,\n        \"b\": 2,\n        \"c\": 3,\n        \"d\": 4\n    }\n\n    # Define a condition function\n    def condition(key, value):\n        return value > 2\n\n    # Filter the dictionary\n    filtered_dictionary = filter_dictionary(dictionary, condition)\n\n    # Print the filtered dictionary\n    print(filtered_dictionary)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `filter_dictionary` takes in a dictionary and a condition function.\n2. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet the condition.\n3. The condition function is called for each key-value pair in the dictionary.\n4. If the condition function returns `True`, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary.\n5. The function returns the new dictionary.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n* Filter a dictionary to only include key-value pairs where the value is greater than a certain threshold.\n* Filter a dictionary to only include key-value pairs where the key matches a certain pattern.\n* Filter a dictionary to only include key-value pairs where the value is of a certain data type.",
