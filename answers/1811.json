  "prompt": "Write a program that plans a travel itinerary based on user input, using conditional statements to determine the travel routes",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that plans a travel itinerary based on user input:\n\n```python\ndef travel_itinerary():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Travel Itinerary Planner!\")\n    \n    # Get user input\n    start_location = input(\"Enter your starting location: \")\n    end_location = input(\"Enter your destination: \")\n    mode_of_transport = input(\"Enter your preferred mode of transport (car, train, plane, bus): \")\n    budget = float(input(\"Enter your budget: \"))\n\n    # Determine travel route based on mode of transport and budget\n    if mode_of_transport.lower() == \"car\":\n        if budget < 500:\n            print(f\"Route: Drive from {start_location} to {end_location} via the highway.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Route: Drive from {start_location} to {end_location} via the scenic route.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"train\":\n        if budget < 200:\n            print(f\"Route: Take the local train from {start_location} to {end_location}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Route: Take the express train from {start_location} to {end_location}.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"plane\":\n        if budget < 1000:\n            print(f\"Route: Fly from {start_location} to {end_location} with a budget airline.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Route: Fly from {start_location} to {end_location} with a premium airline.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"bus\":\n        if budget < 100:\n            print(f\"Route: Take the local bus from {start_location} to {end_location}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Route: Take the express bus from {start_location} to {end_location}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid mode of transport. Please try again.\")\n\n    # Additional suggestions based on mode of transport\n    if mode_of_transport.lower() == \"car\":\n        print(\"Consider stopping at local attractions along the way.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"train\":\n        print(\"Consider booking a seat with extra legroom.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"plane\":\n        print(\"Consider checking in online and printing your boarding pass.\")\n    elif mode_of_transport.lower() == \"bus\":\n        print(\"Consider bringing a book or portable charger.\")\n\n# Run the program\ntravel_itinerary()\n```\n\nThis program asks the user for their starting location, destination, preferred mode of transport, and budget. It then uses conditional statements to determine the travel route based on the user's input. The program also provides additional suggestions based on the mode of transport.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* A user who wants to drive from New York to Los Angeles with a budget of $300 might be suggested to take the highway route.\n* A user who wants to take the train from Paris to Berlin with a budget of $150 might be suggested to take the local train.\n* A user who wants to fly from Tokyo to Sydney with a budget of $500 might be suggested to fly with a budget airline.\n\nNote: This is a simple example and real-world travel planning would require more complex logic and data.",
