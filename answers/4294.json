  "answer": "### Symmetric Difference of Dictionaries\n#### Function Description\nThe function `symmetric_diff` calculates the symmetric difference between two dictionaries. It returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs that are in exactly one of the input dictionaries.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef symmetric_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing key-value pairs that are in exactly one of the input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a new dictionary to store the symmetric difference\n    symmetric_diff_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the items in the first dictionary\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # If the key is not in the second dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict2:\n            symmetric_diff_dict[key] = value\n\n    # Iterate over the items in the second dictionary\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # If the key is not in the first dictionary, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict1:\n            symmetric_diff_dict[key] = value\n        # If the key is in both dictionaries but has different values, add it to the symmetric difference\n        elif key in dict1 and dict1[key] != value:\n            symmetric_diff_dict[key] = value\n\n    return symmetric_diff_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nprint(symmetric_diff(dict1, dict2))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `symmetric_diff` takes two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` as input.\n2. It iterates over the key-value pairs in `dict1` and adds them to the symmetric difference dictionary if the key is not present in `dict2`.\n3. It then iterates over the key-value pairs in `dict2` and adds them to the symmetric difference dictionary if the key is not present in `dict1` or if the key is present in both dictionaries but has different values.\n4. Finally, it returns the symmetric difference dictionary.\n\n#### Output\nFor the example usage, the output will be:\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'b': 20, 'd': 4}\n```",
