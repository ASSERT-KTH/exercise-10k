  "answer": "Here is a Python program that reads a sentence, a word to replace, and a replacement word from the user, and replaces all occurrences of the word:\n\n```python\ndef replace_word(sentence, word_to_replace, replacement_word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replaces all occurrences of a word in a sentence with a replacement word.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The sentence in which to replace the word.\n        word_to_replace (str): The word to replace.\n        replacement_word (str): The word to replace with.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Replace all occurrences of the word\n    replaced_words = [replacement_word if word.lower() == word_to_replace.lower() else word for word in words]\n\n    # Join the words back into a sentence\n    replaced_sentence = ' '.join(replaced_words)\n\n    return replaced_sentence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the sentence, word to replace, and replacement word from the user\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    word_to_replace = input(\"Enter a word to replace: \")\n    replacement_word = input(\"Enter a replacement word: \")\n\n    # Replace all occurrences of the word\n    replaced_sentence = replace_word(sentence, word_to_replace, replacement_word)\n\n    # Print the sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced\n    print(\"Replaced sentence: \", replaced_sentence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `replace_word` that takes a sentence, a word to replace, and a replacement word as input, and returns the sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced. The `main` function reads the sentence, word to replace, and replacement word from the user, calls the `replace_word` function, and prints the sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced.\n\nThe replacement is case-insensitive, meaning that it will replace the word regardless of whether it appears in uppercase or lowercase in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" and the word to replace is \"the\", the replacement will occur regardless of whether \"the\" appears in uppercase or lowercase in the sentence.\n\nYou can run this program, enter a sentence, a word to replace, and a replacement word, and it will print the sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced.",
