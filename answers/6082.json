  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, then uses a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they correctly guess the number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \"))\n            if 1 <= guess <= 100:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Run the random number guessing game.\"\"\"\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    # Keep asking the user for input until they guess the number\n    while True:\n        # Get the user's guess\n        guess = get_user_guess()\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. Enter a whole number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will respond with \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\" to help the user narrow down their next guess.\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.",
