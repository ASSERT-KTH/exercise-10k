  "answer": "**Variable Swap Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.\n\n    Args:\n        a (any): The first variable.\n        b (any): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use tuple packing and unpacking to swap values\n    a, b = b, a\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    var1 = 10\n    var2 = 20\n\n    print(\"Before swap:\")\n    print(f\"var1: {var1}\")\n    print(f\"var2: {var2}\")\n\n    var1, var2 = swap_variables(var1, var2)\n\n    print(\"After swap:\")\n    print(f\"var1: {var1}\")\n    print(f\"var2: {var2}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values of two variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  Define a function `swap_variables` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.\n2.  Inside the function, use the syntax `a, b = b, a` to pack the values of `b` and `a` into a tuple and then immediately unpack the tuple back into the variables `a` and `b`, effectively swapping their values.\n3.  Return the swapped values as a tuple.\n4.  In the example usage section, demonstrate the function's usage by swapping the values of `var1` and `var2` and printing the results before and after the swap.\n\n**Alternative Method**\n--------------------\n\nAlternatively, you can also use arithmetic operations to swap variables without a third variable. However, this method may not work correctly for all data types and can lead to overflow issues for large numbers.\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swaps the values of two variables using arithmetic operations.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use arithmetic operations to swap values\n    a = a + b\n    b = a - b\n    a = a - b\n    return a, b\n```\n\nNote that the arithmetic method is generally not recommended due to its limitations and potential for errors. The tuple packing and unpacking method is a more reliable and Pythonic way to swap variables.",
