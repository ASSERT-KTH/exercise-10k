  "answer": "**Pattern Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds a given pattern in a string. It uses the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm for efficient pattern searching.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef compute_prefix_function(pattern):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the prefix function for the KMP algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n    pattern (str): The pattern to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: The prefix function.\n    \"\"\"\n    prefix = [0] * len(pattern)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(pattern)):\n        while j > 0 and pattern[j] != pattern[i]:\n            j = prefix[j - 1]\n        if pattern[j] == pattern[i]:\n            j += 1\n        prefix[i] = j\n    return prefix\n\ndef kmp_search(text, pattern):\n    \"\"\"\n    Search for a pattern in a text using the KMP algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n    text (str): The text to search in.\n    pattern (str): The pattern to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of indices where the pattern was found.\n    \"\"\"\n    prefix = compute_prefix_function(pattern)\n    indices = []\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(len(text)):\n        while j > 0 and text[i] != pattern[j]:\n            j = prefix[j - 1]\n        if text[i] == pattern[j]:\n            j += 1\n        if j == len(pattern):\n            indices.append(i - j + 1)\n            j = prefix[j - 1]\n    return indices\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter the text: \")\n    pattern = input(\"Enter the pattern: \")\n    indices = kmp_search(text, pattern)\n    if indices:\n        print(f\"Pattern '{pattern}' found at indices: {indices}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pattern '{pattern}' not found in the text.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `compute_prefix_function` function computes the prefix function for the KMP algorithm. This function is used to determine the next position to check in the text when a mismatch occurs.\n2. The `kmp_search` function searches for the pattern in the text using the KMP algorithm. It returns a list of indices where the pattern was found.\n3. The `main` function takes user input for the text and pattern, and prints the indices where the pattern was found.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Find a specific word in a text: Enter the text and the word as the pattern.\n* Find a substring in a text: Enter the text and the substring as the pattern.\n* Find a pattern in a large text file: Modify the program to read from a file instead of user input.\n\nNote: This program uses the KMP algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern. This makes it efficient for searching large texts.",
