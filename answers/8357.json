  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program should handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in two numbers and a choice of operation from the user.\n    It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result.\n    It also handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4): \"))\n            if choice not in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input.

The program first displays a menu of options to the user.\n2. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their choice of operation until a valid input is provided.\n3. Next, it asks the user for two numbers, handling any invalid inputs.\n4. If the user chooses division and the second number is zero, it displays an error message and asks for the second number again.\n5. Finally, it performs the chosen operation and displays the result.",
