  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing a Boolean Variable\n\nBelow is an example in Python that demonstrates how to declare a boolean variable, assign it a value, and then print its value.\n\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable and assign it a value\nis_admin = True\n\n# Print the value of the boolean variable\nprint(is_admin)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `is_admin` is the name of the boolean variable.\n- `True` is the boolean value assigned to `is_admin`. In most programming languages, boolean values are represented as `true` or `false`, `True` or `False`, depending on the case sensitivity of the language.\n- `print(is_admin)` is used to output the value of `is_admin` to the console.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n```\nTrue\n```\n\nYou can change the value assigned to `is_admin` to `False` to see the difference in output.",
