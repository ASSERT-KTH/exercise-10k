  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but replaces multiples of 3 and 5 with 'Fizz' and 'Buzz' respectively.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i) {\n        if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"FizzBuzz\" << std::endl;\n        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"Fizz\" << std::endl;\n        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"Buzz\" << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << i << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It includes the `iostream` header file for input/output operations.\n2. It defines the `main` function as the entry point of the program.\n3. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100 (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, it checks the current number `i` for the conditions outlined in the specification, printing the corresponding output for each condition.\n5. Finally, it returns 0 from the `main` function to indicate successful program execution.\n\nThis program will print the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with \"Fizz\", multiples of 5 with \"Buzz\", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with \"FizzBuzz\".",
