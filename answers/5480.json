  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array as input and returns a new array containing only the unique elements of the original array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that satisfies the provided specification:\n```python\ndef unique_array(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array as input, removes duplicate elements, and returns a new array.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique = []\n    for element in array:\n        if element not in unique:\n            unique.append(element)\n    return unique\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155, 88, 120, 155]\nresult = unique_array(array)\nprint(result)\n```\nNote that I used a simple iterative approach to implement the `unique_array` function, as described in the specification. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the `in` operator, but it is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nAs mentioned in the specification, there are alternative approaches to achieving the same result, such as using a `set` data structure or a more efficient algorithm. However, the provided code meets the requirements and is a good starting point for exploring more efficient solutions.",
