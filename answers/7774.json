  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), 80 <= score < 90 (B), 70 <= score < 80 (C), 60 <= score < 70 (D), score < 60 (F). The program should also handle cases where the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code that matches the given specifications:\n\n```python\ndef get_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef get_letter_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Example usage:\nscore = 85\nprint(get_grade(score))\nprint(get_letter_grade(score))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `get_grade` and `get_letter_grade` functions, which implement the grade calculation logic. The example usage at the end shows how to call these functions with a sample score and print the resulting grade.",
