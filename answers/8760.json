  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n====================================\n\nThe following function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix.\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strings (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strings:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strings, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for string in strings:\n            if string[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    strings = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2.  Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3.  Iterate over each character in the shortest string.\n4.  For each character, check if it is the same in all strings at the same position. If it is not, return the prefix up to the current position.\n5.  If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, return the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string. This is because we are iterating over each character in the shortest string and checking it against all strings.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.",
