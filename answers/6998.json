  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and returns its surface area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cube.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\n\ndef main():\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is {surface_area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_surface_area` function takes one argument, `side_length`, which is the length of one side of the cube.\n*   The function first checks if the `side_length` is negative, and if so, it raises a `ValueError` because the side length of a cube cannot be negative.\n*   The surface area of a cube is calculated using the formula `6 * (side_length ** 2)`, where `**` is the exponentiation operator in Python.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube, calls `calculate_surface_area` with the user's input, and prints the result.\n*   If the user enters a negative number, the program catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.",
