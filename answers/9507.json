  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input, and then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should be printed to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef area(length, width):\n    result = length * width\n    return result\n\n# Function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle\ndef perimeter(length, width):\n    result = 2 * (length + width)\n    return result\n\n# Main program\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area_result = area(length, width)\n    perimeter_result = perimeter(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The area of the rectangle is:\", area_result)\n    print(\"The perimeter of the rectangle is:\", perimeter_result)\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `area` and `perimeter` functions as specified, and then uses the `main` function to get the input from the user, calculate the area and perimeter, and print the results. The program uses `float` to get the input from the user, which allows for decimal values. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
