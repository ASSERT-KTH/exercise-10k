  "answer": "Here's a Python program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its sides.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The length of the first side of the triangle.\n        b (float): The length of the second side of the triangle.\n        c (float): The length of the third side of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the triangle.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the sides do not form a valid triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"The sides do not form a valid triangle.\")\n\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = a + b + c\n    return perimeter\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the lengths of the sides from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first side: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second side: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of the third side: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the perimeter\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the triangle is {perimeter:.2f}.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_perimeter` function takes the lengths of the three sides as arguments and returns the perimeter of the triangle.\n*   It first checks if the sides form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n*   If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   Otherwise, it calculates the perimeter by summing the lengths of the three sides and returns the result.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the lengths of the three sides.\n*   The program then attempts to calculate and print the perimeter using the `calculate_perimeter` function.\n*   If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the program catches the `ValueError` and prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n*   Run the program.\n*   Enter the lengths of the sides of a triangle when prompted (e.g., 3, 4, 5).\n*   The program will print the perimeter of the triangle (e.g., 12.00).",
