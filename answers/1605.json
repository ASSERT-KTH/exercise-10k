  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the modulus (remainder) of two integers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_modulus(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the modulus (remainder) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend (first integer): \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor (second integer): \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the modulus\n        modulus = calculate_modulus(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"The modulus (remainder) of {dividend} and {divisor} is {modulus}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `calculate_modulus` function takes two integers as input: `dividend` (the number being divided) and `divisor` (the number by which we are dividing).\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero, and if so, raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.\n3. If the `divisor` is not zero, it calculates the modulus using the `%` operator and returns the result.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter two integers, calls `calculate_modulus` with these integers, and prints the result.\n5. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, it catches the exception and prints an error message.\n\n### Example use case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter two integers. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the dividend (first integer): 17\nEnter the divisor (second integer): 5\nThe modulus (remainder) of 17 and 5 is 2\n```\n\nIn this example, the modulus of 17 and 5 is 2 because 17 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2.",
