  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two variables:\n\n```python\n# Define two variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 5\n\n# Perform arithmetic operations\naddition = num1 + num2\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\ndivision = num1 / num2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\nprint(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output the results of the arithmetic operations on the two variables `num1` and `num2`.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nAddition: 10 + 5 = 15\nSubtraction: 10 - 5 = 5\nMultiplication: 10 * 5 = 50\nDivision: 10 / 5 = 2.0\n```\n\nYou can modify the values of `num1` and `num2` to perform arithmetic operations on different numbers.",
