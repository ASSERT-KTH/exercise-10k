  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result of the operation. The operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to be performed.\n                         Can be '+', '-', '*', '/' or 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        '/': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf'),\n        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation in operations:\n        # Perform the operation and return the result\n        return operations[operation](num1, num2)\n    else:\n        # Raise an error if the operation is not valid\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Supported operations are '+', '-', '*', '/' or 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Take input from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, / or add, subtract, multiply, divide): \")\n\n    # Calculate and print the result\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation} {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result of the operation.\n*   It uses a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions.\n*   The function checks if the operation is valid and raises an error if it's not.\n*   The `main` function takes input from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program handles division by zero by returning infinity.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Addition**: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` or `add` as the operation. The program will output `The result of + 10.0 and 5.0 is 15.0`.\n*   **Subtraction**: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `-` or `subtract` as the operation. The program will output `The result of - 10.0 and 5.0 is 5.0`.\n*   **Multiplication**: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` or `multiply` as the operation. The program will output `The result of * 10.0 and 5.0 is 50.0`.\n*   **Division**: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `/` or `divide` as the operation. The program will output `The result of / 10.0 and 5.0 is 2.0`.",
