  "answer": "**Quiz Generator Function**\n================================\n\nThe following Python function generates a quiz with a set of questions and answers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Question:\n    def __init__(self, question, answers, correct_answer):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Question object.\n\n        Args:\n            question (str): The question text.\n            answers (list): A list of possible answers.\n            correct_answer (str): The correct answer.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.question = question\n        self.answers = answers\n        self.correct_answer = correct_answer\n\ndef generate_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a quiz with the given questions.\n\n    Args:\n        questions (list): A list of Question objects.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for i, question in enumerate(questions):\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion {i+1}: {question.question}\")\n        random_answers = random.sample(question.answers, len(question.answers))\n        for j, answer in enumerate(random_answers):\n            print(f\"{j+1}. {answer}\")\n        user_answer = input(\"Enter the number of your answer: \")\n        if random_answers[int(user_answer) - 1] == question.correct_answer:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {question.correct_answer}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz completed. Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    questions = [\n        Question(\"What is the capital of France?\", [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Rome\"], \"Paris\"),\n        Question(\"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\", [\"Earth\", \"Saturn\", \"Jupiter\", \"Uranus\"], \"Jupiter\"),\n        Question(\"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\", [\"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Raphael\", \"Caravaggio\"], \"Leonardo da Vinci\")\n    ]\n    generate_quiz(questions)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a `Question` class to represent a question with its text, possible answers, and the correct answer.\n2. The `generate_quiz` function takes a list of `Question` objects as input.\n3. It iterates through the questions, shuffles the answers, and prompts the user to enter the number of their answer.\n4. It checks if the user's answer is correct and updates the score accordingly.\n5. Finally, it prints the final score.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this code, simply create a list of `Question` objects and pass it to the `generate_quiz` function. The example usage in the code demonstrates how to create a quiz with three questions. You can add or remove questions as needed.",
