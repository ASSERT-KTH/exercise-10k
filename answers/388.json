  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to apply the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The GCD is then returned as the absolute value of `a`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 12 and 15: `calculate_gcd(12, 15)` returns 3\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns 6\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two integers. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log min(a, b)).",
