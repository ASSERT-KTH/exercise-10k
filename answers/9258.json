  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the keys of a dictionary and handles potential errors:\n\n```python\ndef print_dict_keys(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the keys of a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to print keys from.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Check if the input is a dictionary\n        if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):\n            raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n        # Print the keys of the dictionary\n        for key in input_dict.keys():\n            print(key)\n\n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nprint_dict_keys(my_dict)\n\n# Error handling example\nprint_dict_keys(\"Not a dictionary\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `print_dict_keys` that takes a dictionary as input and prints its keys. It includes error handling to catch potential errors, such as if the input is not a dictionary. The `isinstance` function is used to check if the input is a dictionary, and a `TypeError` is raised if it is not. The function also includes a general `Exception` handler to catch any unexpected errors. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a valid dictionary and how it handles an invalid input.",
