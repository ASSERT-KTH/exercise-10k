  "answer": "**24 Game Generator**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates four random numbers and asks the user to create an equation that equals 24 using basic arithmetic operations.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport operator\n\n# Define the basic arithmetic operations\noperations = {\n    operator.add: '+',\n    operator.sub: '-',\n    operator.mul: '*',\n    operator.truediv: '/'\n}\n\ndef generate_numbers():\n    \"\"\"Generate four random numbers between 1 and 10\"\"\"\n    return [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(4)]\n\ndef get_user_equation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Ask the user to input an equation\"\"\"\n    print(\"Create an equation that equals 24 using the numbers:\", numbers)\n    equation = input(\"Enter your equation: \")\n    return equation\n\ndef evaluate_equation(equation):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the user's equation\"\"\"\n    try:\n        result = eval(equation)\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid equation.\")\n        return None\n\ndef check_solution(result):\n    \"\"\"Check if the equation equals 24\"\"\"\n    if result == 24:\n        print(\" Congratulations! Your equation is correct.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, your equation does not equal 24.\")\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = generate_numbers()\n    equation = get_user_equation(numbers)\n    result = evaluate_equation(equation)\n    if result is not None:\n        check_solution(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate four random numbers and display them.\n3. Enter an equation using the generated numbers and basic arithmetic operations.\n4. The program will evaluate the equation and check if the result equals 24.\n\nNote: This program uses the `eval` function to evaluate the user's equation, which can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input. In this case, the input is coming from the user, so it's up to the user to enter a valid equation.",
