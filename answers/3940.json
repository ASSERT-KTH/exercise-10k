  "answer": "Here's a Python program that simulates rolling two dice, calculates the average and standard deviation of the sums, and provides a clear explanation of the code.\n\n**Dice Roll Simulator**\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    \"\"\"Simulate rolling two dice and return the sum.\"\"\"\n    dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    return dice1 + dice2\n\ndef calculate_average(sums):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the average of the sums.\"\"\"\n    return sum(sums) / len(sums)\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(sums, average):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of the sums.\"\"\"\n    variance = sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in sums) / len(sums)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    num_rolls = 10000  # Number of times to roll the dice\n    sums = [roll_dice() for _ in range(num_rolls)]  # Simulate rolling the dice\n\n    average = calculate_average(sums)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(sums, average)\n\n    print(f\"Average sum: {average:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Standard deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The `roll_dice` function simulates rolling two dice by generating two random numbers between 1 and 6, and returning their sum.\n2. The `calculate_average` function calculates the average of a list of sums by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n3. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation of a list of sums by first calculating the variance (the average of the squared differences from the mean), and then taking the square root of the variance.\n4. In the `main` function, we simulate rolling the dice `num_rolls` times, and store the sums in a list. We then calculate the average and standard deviation of the sums using the `calculate_average` and `calculate_standard_deviation` functions, respectively.\n5. Finally, we print the average and standard deviation of the sums to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nRunning this program will output the average and standard deviation of the sums of rolling two dice `num_rolls` times. For example:\n```\nAverage sum: 7.00\nStandard deviation: 2.42\n```\nThis indicates that the average sum of rolling two dice is approximately 7, with a standard deviation of approximately 2.42.",
