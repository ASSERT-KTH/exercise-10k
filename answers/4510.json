  "answer": "**Student Average Grade Calculator**\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects. It takes into account the scores and their respective weights.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(scores, weights=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (dict): Dictionary of subject names and their respective scores.\n        weights (dict, optional): Dictionary of subject names and their respective weights. Defaults to equal weights for all subjects.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if weights is None:\n        # If no weights are provided, assign equal weights to all subjects\n        weights = {subject: 1 / len(scores) for subject in scores}\n\n    total_score = sum(scores[subject] * weights[subject] for subject in scores)\n    total_weight = sum(weights.values())\n\n    average_grade = total_score / total_weight\n\n    return average_grade\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    scores = {\n        \"Math\": 85,\n        \"Science\": 90,\n        \"English\": 78,\n        \"History\": 92\n    }\n\n    # Optional weights\n    weights = {\n        \"Math\": 0.3,\n        \"Science\": 0.3,\n        \"English\": 0.2,\n        \"History\": 0.2\n    }\n\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores, weights)\n    print(f\"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes in a dictionary of subject names and their respective scores, as well as an optional dictionary of subject names and their respective weights.\n2. If no weights are provided, the function assigns equal weights to all subjects.\n3. The function calculates the total score by multiplying each score with its corresponding weight and summing them up.\n4. The function calculates the total weight by summing up all the weights.\n5. The average grade is calculated by dividing the total score by the total weight.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of the `calculate_average_grade` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average grade of a student with equal weights for all subjects:\n```python\nscores = {\n    \"Math\": 85,\n    \"Science\": 90,\n    \"English\": 78,\n    \"History\": 92\n}\naverage_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores)\n```\n* Calculate the average grade of a student with custom weights for each subject:\n```python\nscores = {\n    \"Math\": 85,\n    \"Science\": 90,\n    \"English\": 78,\n    \"History\": 92\n}\nweights = {\n    \"Math\": 0.3,\n    \"Science\": 0.3,\n    \"English\": 0.2,\n    \"History\": 0.2\n}\naverage_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores, weights)\n```",
