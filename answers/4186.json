  "answer": "**Mad Libs Story Generator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function generates a Mad Libs story based on user input. It asks for different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and then fills in a story template with these words.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_word(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Get a word from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        word = input(prompt)\n        if word:\n            return word\n        print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\ndef generate_mad_libs_story():\n    \"\"\"Generate a Mad Libs story based on user input.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Mad Libs story generator!\")\n    print(\"Please provide the following words:\")\n\n    # Get words from the user\n    noun1 = get_word(\"Enter a noun (e.g., book, car, apple): \")\n    verb1 = get_word(\"Enter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): \")\n    adjective1 = get_word(\"Enter an adjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): \")\n    noun2 = get_word(\"Enter another noun (e.g., dog, city, pencil): \")\n    verb2 = get_word(\"Enter another verb (e.g., dance, sing, write): \")\n    adjective2 = get_word(\"Enter another adjective (e.g., big, soft, blue): \")\n\n    # Story template\n    story_template = \"\"\"\n    Yesterday, I saw a {adjective1} {noun1} walking down the street.\n    I was so surprised that I started to {verb1} all the way home.\n    When I got home, I saw my {adjective2} {noun2} waiting for me.\n    I was so happy to see it that I started to {verb2} with joy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Fill in the story template with the user's words\n    story = story_template.format(\n        adjective1=adjective1,\n        noun1=noun1,\n        verb1=verb1,\n        adjective2=adjective2,\n        noun2=noun2,\n        verb2=verb2\n    )\n\n    # Print the generated story\n    print(\"\\nHere is your Mad Libs story:\")\n    print(story)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    generate_mad_libs_story()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_word` function is used to get a word from the user. It checks if the input is not empty and returns the word.\n2. The `generate_mad_libs_story` function is the main function that generates the Mad Libs story.\n3. It asks the user for different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) using the `get_word` function.\n4. It then fills in a story template with the user's words using the `format` method.\n5. Finally, it prints the generated story.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the `generate_mad_libs_story` function, it will ask you for different types of words. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to the Mad Libs story generator!\nPlease provide the following words:\nEnter a noun (e.g., book, car, apple): cat\nEnter a verb (e.g., run, jump, read): dance\nEnter an adjective (e.g., happy, tall, green): big\nEnter another noun (e.g., dog, city, pencil): house\nEnter another verb (e.g., dance, sing, write): sing\nEnter another adjective (e.g., big, soft, blue): small\n\nHere is your Mad Libs story:\nYesterday, I saw a big cat walking down the street.\nI was so surprised that I started to dance all the way home.\nWhen I got home, I saw my small house waiting for me.\nI was so happy to see it that I started to sing with joy.\n```",
