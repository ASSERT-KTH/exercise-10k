  "answer": "### Most Frequent Character Function\n#### Overview\nThis function takes a string as input, counts the frequency of each character, and returns the most frequent character.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the most frequent character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The most frequent character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_counts = Counter(s)\n    \n    # Return the most frequent character\n    return char_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n# Example usage\nprint(most_frequent_char(\"Hello World\"))  # Output: l\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `most_frequent_char` takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It removes whitespace from the string using the `replace` method and converts it to lowercase using the `lower` method.\n3. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.\n4. It returns the most frequent character by calling the `most_common` method on the `Counter` object and selecting the first element of the resulting list.\n\n#### Note\nIf there are multiple characters with the same highest frequency, this function will return one of them. If you need to return all characters with the highest frequency, you can modify the function to return all characters with the maximum count.",
