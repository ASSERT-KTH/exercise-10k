  "answer": "### Sorting a Dictionary by Values\n\nYou can use the built-in `sorted` function in Python to sort a dictionary by its values. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_values(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary sorted by its values.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary sorted by its values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(sorted(input_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}\nsorted_dict = sort_dict_by_values(input_dict)\nprint(sorted_dict)\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n\n1. Using the `items` method to get a list of tuples containing each key-value pair in the dictionary.\n2. Using the `sorted` function to sort this list of tuples based on the value (which is the second item in each tuple, accessed using `item[1]`).\n3. Using the `dict` function to convert the sorted list of tuples back into a dictionary.\n\nNote: In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain their insertion order, so the resulting dictionary will be sorted by its values. However, in earlier versions of Python, dictionaries do not maintain their insertion order, so the resulting dictionary may not be sorted.\n\nIf you want to sort the dictionary in descending order (i.e., with the largest value first), you can pass the `reverse=True` argument to the `sorted` function:\n\n```python\nreturn dict(sorted(input_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))\n```\n\n### Handling Ties\n\nIf there are multiple key-value pairs with the same value, their order in the sorted dictionary will be arbitrary. If you want to break ties based on the key, you can modify the `key` function to return a tuple containing the value and the key:\n\n```python\nreturn dict(sorted(input_dict.items(), key=lambda item: (item[1], item[0])))\n```\n\nThis will sort the dictionary by value, and then by key in case of ties. If you want to break ties based on the key in descending order, you can modify the `key` function to return a tuple containing the value and the negative of the key (since Python's sorting is stable and sorts tuples lexicographically):\n\n```python\nreturn dict(sorted(input_dict.items(), key=lambda item: (item[1], -ord(item[0]))))\n```",
