  "prompt": "Write a program that prints all prime numbers from 1 to a given number (n) using a while loop. The program should ask for user input to get the value of n.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user input and validate that it's a positive integer\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            n = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if n <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                return n\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid integer.\")\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime\"\"\"\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef print_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"Print all prime numbers from 1 to n\"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        if is_prime(i):\n            print(i, end=\" \")\n        i += 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = get_user_input()\n    print(\"Prime numbers from 1 to\", n, \"are:\")\n    print_primes(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program consists of four main functions:\n\n1. `get_user_input()`: This function asks the user for a positive integer input and validates that the input is indeed a positive integer. If the input is not valid, it asks the user again.\n\n2. `is_prime(num)`: This function checks if a given number is prime. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is, then the number is not prime.\n\n3. `print_primes(n)`: This function prints all prime numbers from 1 to `n`. It does this by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime(num)` function. If a number is prime, it prints the number.\n\n4. `main()`: This function is the main entry point of the program. It calls `get_user_input()` to get the value of `n`, then calls `print_primes(n)` to print all prime numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a positive integer. For example, if you enter `20`, it will print all prime numbers from 1 to 20:\n\n```\nEnter a positive integer: 20\nPrime numbers from 1 to 20 are:\n2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19\n```",
