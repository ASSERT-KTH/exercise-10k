  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and range of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and range of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and range of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    range_ = max(numbers) - min(numbers)\n    return mean, median, range_\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the list of numbers from the user\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n\n    # Calculate the statistics\n    mean, median, range_ = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Range: {range_}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the mean, median, and range.\n2. The `statistics.mean` function is used to calculate the mean of the list.\n3. The `statistics.median` function is used to calculate the median of the list.\n4. The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the list.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n6. The input is parsed into a list of floats and passed to the `calculate_statistics` function.\n7. The results are then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf the user enters the following list of numbers: `1 2 3 4 5`\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nMean: 3.0\nMedian: 3\nRange: 4\n```",
