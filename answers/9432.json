  "answer": "### Creating a Closure to Add a Given Number\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following Python function creates and returns a closure. This closure takes one argument and returns the sum of the closure's creation argument and the input argument.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef create_adder(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a closure that adds a given number to its input.\n\n    Args:\n    num (int): The number to be added.\n\n    Returns:\n    function: A closure that takes one argument and returns the sum of num and the input.\n    \"\"\"\n    def adder(x):\n        # The closure has access to the variables in the surrounding scope\n        return x + num\n    return adder\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a closure that adds 5 to its input\n    add_five = create_adder(5)\n    \n    # Use the closure\n    print(add_five(10))  # Outputs: 15\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `create_adder` function takes one argument `num`.\n2. Inside `create_adder`, a nested function `adder` is defined. This function takes one argument `x`.\n3. The `adder` function returns the sum of `x` and `num`.\n4. The `create_adder` function returns the `adder` function, which has access to the variables in the surrounding scope, including `num`.\n5. When `create_adder` is called with a specific number, it returns a closure that adds that number to its input.\n6. This closure can be used like any other function.",
