  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the original string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string word;\n    std::cout << \"Enter a word: \";\n    std::cin >> word;\n    int len = word.length();\n    std::string rev = \"\";\n\n    for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        rev += word[i];\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Reversed word: \" << rev << std::endl;\n\n    if (rev == word) {\n        std::cout << \"The word is a palindrome.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"The word is not a palindrome.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly:\n\n1. It includes the necessary header files `iostream` and `string`.\n2. It defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.\n3. It prompts the user to enter a word and reads the input into the `word` variable.\n4. It gets the length of the input word using the `length()` method and stores it in the `len` variable.\n5. It creates an empty string `rev` to store the reversed word.\n6. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input word in reverse order, adding each character to the `rev` string.\n7. It prints the reversed word to the console.\n8. It checks if the reversed word is the same as the original word by comparing the `rev` and `word` variables using the `==` operator. If they are the same, it prints a message indicating that the word is a palindrome. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the word is not a palindrome.\n9. The program returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution.\n\nNote that this code is written in C++ and uses the `std::string` class to manipulate strings.",
