  "answer": "**Common Elements in Two Arrays**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the common elements in two arrays. It uses Python as the programming language and includes a function to find the common elements.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(array1, array2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the common elements in two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        array1 (list): The first array.\n        array2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(array1) & set(array2))\n\n# Example usage:\narray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\ncommon_elements = find_common_elements(array1, array2)\nprint(\"Common elements:\", common_elements)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `find_common_elements` function takes two arrays as input.\n2. It converts the arrays to sets using the `set()` function.\n3. It uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives the common elements.\n4. It converts the resulting set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The function returns the list of common elements.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nCommon elements: [4, 5]\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays. This is because the `set()` function has a time complexity of O(n) and the `&` operator has a time complexity of O(min(n, m)). The `list()` function has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of common elements.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays. This is because the `set()` function creates a new set with a size of up to n or m, and the `&` operator creates a new set with a size of up to min(n, m). The `list()` function creates a new list with a size of up to k, where k is the number of common elements.",
