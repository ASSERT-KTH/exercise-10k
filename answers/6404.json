  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is even or odd. Use if/else statements to determine the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if an integer is even or odd:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is odd.\")\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `check_even_odd` that takes an integer `num` as input. Inside the function, we use an if/else statement to check if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is 0. If it is, then the number is even, and we print a message saying so. If it's not, then the number is odd, and we print a message saying that.\n\nWe then test the function by asking the user to input an integer, converting it to an integer with `int()`, and passing it to the `check_even_odd` function.\n\nYou can also write a more concise version using a ternary operator:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    print(f\"{num} is {'even' if num % 2 == 0 else 'odd'}.\")\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\nThis version does the same thing, but in a single line. The ternary operator `{'even' if num % 2 == 0 else 'odd'}` returns the string `'even'` if the condition is true, and `'odd'` otherwise.",
