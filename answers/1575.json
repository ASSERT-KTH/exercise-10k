  "prompt": "Write a function that uses the map function to apply a given function to a list of numbers and return the results.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a given function to a list of numbers using the map function and returns the results. This will help you understand how to utilize the map function for similar tasks. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_function(func, numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to a list of numbers and returns the results.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied to the list of numbers.\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of results after applying the function to each number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are numbers\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list) or not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of numbers\")\n\n    # We use the map function to apply the given function to each number in the list\n    # The map function returns a map object, which is an iterator, so we need to convert it to a list\n    # We use the list function to convert the map object to a list\n    results = list(map(func, numbers))\n\n    # Finally, we return the list of results\n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(apply_function(square, numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `apply_function` takes two parameters: `func` (the function to be applied) and `numbers` (the list of numbers). It first checks if the input `numbers` is a list and if all elements in the list are numbers.\n* It uses the `map` function to apply the given function `func` to each number in the list `numbers`. The `map` function returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n* The `list` function is used to convert the map object to a list, which is then returned as the result.\n* In the example usage, a function `square` is defined to calculate the square of a number. This function is then applied to a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using the `apply_function`, and the results are printed.",
