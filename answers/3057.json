  "answer": "### Creating a Closure to Add a Given Number\n\nBelow is an example of how you can create a closure in JavaScript to add a given number to its input:\n\n```javascript\n// Function to create a closure that adds a given number to its input\nfunction createAdder(num) {\n    // The closure has access to 'num' even after createAdder has returned\n    return function add(input) {\n        return input + num;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Create a function that adds 5 to its input\nconst addFive = createAdder(5);\n\n// Use the addFive function\nconsole.log(addFive(10));  // Outputs: 15\n\n// Create a function that adds 3 to its input\nconst addThree = createAdder(3);\n\n// Use the addThree function\nconsole.log(addThree(10));  // Outputs: 13\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Outer Function (`createAdder`):** This function takes a number (`num`) as an argument and returns another function (`add`).\n2. **Inner Function (`add`):** This function takes an input and adds `num` to it. Even after `createAdder` has returned, `add` still has access to `num` because of how closures work in JavaScript.\n3. **Creating Specific Adder Functions:** By calling `createAdder` with different numbers, you can create functions that add those specific numbers to their inputs.\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple yet powerful use of closures: creating functions that \"remember\" the context in which they were created, allowing for flexible and dynamic function generation.",
