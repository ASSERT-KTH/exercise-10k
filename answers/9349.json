  "prompt": "Write a program to demonstrate the difference between let, const, and var.",
  "answer": "```javascript\n// Python does not have a direct equivalent of 'let' and 'const' like JavaScript.\n// However, we can use the 'var' keyword to demonstrate the difference.\n\n// 'var' is the most common keyword used to declare a variable in JavaScript.\n// However, in Python, we don't need to use any keyword to declare a variable.\n\n// Using 'var' (or no keyword in Python) allows the variable to be reassigned.\nvar x = 5;\nx = 10;\nconsole.log(x);  // prints 10\n\n// Python has no direct equivalent of 'const' either, but we can use the 'final' type hint in Python 3.8+ to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned.\n// However, this is only a hint and does not prevent reassignment.\n\n// 'const' in JavaScript is used to declare a constant, which cannot be reassigned.\n// In Python, we can use the 'final' type hint to achieve similar behavior.\n// Note: This is only a hint and does not prevent reassignment.\nconst y = 5;\ntry {\n    y = 10;\n} catch (error) {\n    console.log(\"Assignment to constant variable.\");\n}\n\n// 'let' in JavaScript is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block it is declared in.\n// In Python, variables are scoped to the nearest enclosing function or class.\n// We can demonstrate this using a for loop.\n\n// Using 'let' (or no keyword in Python) in a for loop means the variable is only accessible within the loop.\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\ntry {\n    console.log(i);\n} catch (error) {\n    console.log(\"Variable 'i' is not defined.\");\n}\n```",
