  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array and two indices as input, and returns a new array where the elements at the given indices are swapped. The function should not modify the original array.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that swaps elements at given indices in an array without modifying the original array. This function will take an array and two indices as input and return a new array with the elements at the specified indices swapped. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef swap_elements(array, index1, index2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array and two indices as input, \n    and returns a new array where the elements at the given indices are swapped.\n    \n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        index1 (int): The first index.\n        index2 (int): The second index.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A new array with the elements at the given indices swapped.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to make a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it\n    new_array = array.copy()\n    \n    # Then, we check if the indices are valid (i.e., they are within the bounds of the array)\n    if index1 < len(new_array) and index2 < len(new_array):\n        \n        # Now, we can swap the elements at the given indices\n        # We use tuple packing and unpacking to achieve this in a single line\n        new_array[index1], new_array[index2] = new_array[index2], new_array[index1]\n    \n    # Finally, we return the new array with the elements swapped\n    return new_array\n\n# Test the function\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nindex1 = 1\nindex2 = 3\nprint(swap_elements(array, index1, index2))  # Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   To avoid modifying the original array, we create a copy of it using the `copy()` method and store it in the `new_array` variable.\n*   We then check if the provided indices (`index1` and `index2`) are within the bounds of the `new_array` to prevent index errors.\n*   If the indices are valid, we swap the elements at `index1` and `index2` in `new_array` using tuple packing and unpacking.\n*   Finally, we return the `new_array` with the elements swapped.",
