  "answer": "### Function to Create a Dictionary from a String\n#### Description\nThe following Python function takes a string as input, splits it into words, and returns a dictionary where each word is a key and its frequency is the value.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef word_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a dictionary from a string where each word is a key and its frequency is the value.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is a unique word and its corresponding value is the frequency.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase and split it into words\n    words = string.lower().split()\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the word frequencies\n    frequency_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove any punctuation from the word\n        word = ''.join(e for e in word if e.isalnum())\n        \n        # If the word is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if word in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[word] += 1\n        # Otherwise, add the word to the dictionary with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[word] = 1\n\n    return frequency_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    string = \"This is a test string. This string is just a test.\"\n    print(word_frequency(string))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `word_frequency` takes a string as input and converts it to lowercase to ensure the word count is case-insensitive.\n2. It splits the string into words using the `split` method.\n3. It initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the word frequencies.\n4. It iterates over each word in the list of words, removes any punctuation, and checks if the word is already in the dictionary.\n5. If the word is already in the dictionary, it increments the count; otherwise, it adds the word to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n6. Finally, it returns the dictionary containing the word frequencies.\n\n#### Example Output\nFor the input string \"This is a test string. This string is just a test.\", the function will output:\n```markdown\n{\n    'this': 2, \n    'is': 2, \n    'a': 2, \n    'test': 2, \n    'string': 2, \n    'just': 1\n}\n```",
