  "answer": "**Bill Splitter Program**\n=========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the amount each person in a group needs to pay when splitting a bill. It takes into account the total bill amount, the number of people, and whether a tip should be included.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_split_bill(total_bill, num_people, tip_percentage=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the amount each person needs to pay when splitting a bill.\n\n    Args:\n        total_bill (float): The total bill amount.\n        num_people (int): The number of people splitting the bill.\n        tip_percentage (float, optional): The tip percentage. Defaults to 0.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The amount each person needs to pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_people <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of people must be greater than 0\")\n    if total_bill < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Total bill amount cannot be negative\")\n    if tip_percentage < 0 or tip_percentage > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Tip percentage must be between 0 and 100\")\n\n    # Calculate the total amount including tip\n    if tip_percentage > 0:\n        total_amount = total_bill + (total_bill * (tip_percentage / 100))\n    else:\n        total_amount = total_bill\n\n    # Calculate the amount each person needs to pay\n    split_amount = total_amount / num_people\n\n    return split_amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Bill Splitter Program\")\n    print(\"---------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill amount: $\"))\n    num_people = int(input(\"Enter the number of people splitting the bill: \"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (0 for no tip): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the split amount\n    try:\n        split_amount = calculate_split_bill(total_bill, num_people, tip_percentage)\n        print(f\"Each person needs to pay: ${split_amount:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **No tip**: Total bill amount = $100, Number of people = 4, Tip percentage = 0\n\t* Output: Each person needs to pay: $25.00\n2. **With tip**: Total bill amount = $100, Number of people = 4, Tip percentage = 15\n\t* Output: Each person needs to pay: $28.75\n3. **Invalid input**: Total bill amount = -$100, Number of people = 4, Tip percentage = 15\n\t* Output: Error: Total bill amount cannot be negative\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program uses a `calculate_split_bill` function to calculate the amount each person needs to pay. It takes into account the total bill amount, the number of people, and whether a tip should be included. The function raises `ValueError` exceptions for invalid input.\n\nThe `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_split_bill` function, and displays the result. It also handles any exceptions raised by the `calculate_split_bill` function.",
