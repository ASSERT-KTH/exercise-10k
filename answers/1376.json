  "answer": "**Bank Deposit Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the interest earned on a bank deposit based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the interest earned on a bank deposit.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial deposit amount.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total interest earned.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Bank Deposit Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate interest\n    interest = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Calculate total amount\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n\n    # Display results\n    print(\"\\nResults:\")\n    print(f\"Principal Amount: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {rate * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Time Period: {time} years\")\n    print(f\"Total Interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the total interest earned and the total amount.\n\n**Example Input/Output:**\n\n```\nBank Deposit Interest Calculator\n---------------------------------\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the annual interest rate (in %): 4\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\n\nResults:\nPrincipal Amount: $1000.00\nInterest Rate: 4.0%\nTime Period: 2 years\nTotal Interest: $80.00\nTotal Amount: $1080.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The interest rate is assumed to be annual and compounded annually.\n* The program uses the simple interest formula: `I = P * r * t`, where `I` is the interest, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.\n* The program displays the results with two decimal places for monetary values.",
