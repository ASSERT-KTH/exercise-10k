  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\nThis program validates a password based on the following conditions:\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a password based on the following conditions:\n    * The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n    * The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n    * The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n    * The password must contain at least one digit.\n    * The password must contain at least one special character.\n    \n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        print(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one digit.\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one special character.\")\n        return False\n    \n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    validate_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses regular expressions to check if the password meets the required conditions. The `validate_password` function takes a password as input and checks each condition in sequence. If any condition is not met, it prints an error message and returns `False`. If all conditions are met, it prints a success message and returns `True`.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `validate_password` function by prompting the user to enter a password and then validating it.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a password that meets all the conditions: `P@ssw0rd`\n* Enter a password that is too short: `P@ss`\n* Enter a password that does not contain an uppercase letter: `p@ssw0rd`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a lowercase letter: `P@SSW0RD`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a digit: `P@ssword`\n* Enter a password that does not contain a special character: `Password123`",
