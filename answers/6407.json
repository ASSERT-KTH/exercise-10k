  "answer": "**Simple Message Response Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses if/else statements to determine a response to user input. It checks the user's input and prints out a corresponding message.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user input and strip leading/trailing whitespace.\"\"\"\n    return input(\"Please enter a message: \").strip().lower()\n\ndef respond_to_input(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Determine a response based on user input.\"\"\"\n    if user_input == \"hello\":\n        return \"Hello! How are you today?\"\n    elif user_input == \"goodbye\":\n        return \"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\"\n    elif user_input == \"how are you\":\n        return \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking.\"\n    else:\n        return \"I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main program loop.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the simple message response program.\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = get_user_input()\n        if user_input == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        print(respond_to_input(user_input))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* User enters \"hello\": Program responds with \"Hello! How are you today?\"\n* User enters \"goodbye\": Program responds with \"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\"\n* User enters \"how are you\": Program responds with \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking.\"\n* User enters anything else: Program responds with \"I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?\"\n* User enters \"quit\": Program exits and prints \"Goodbye!\"\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `message_response.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.\n3. Run the program using `python message_response.py`.\n4. Interact with the program by entering messages and viewing the responses.",
