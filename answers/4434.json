  "answer": "**Word Scramble Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it. It uses a while loop to continuously ask for input until the correct answer is given.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a word by shuffling its characters.\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    word = \"hello\"  # Change this to any word you want\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == word.lower():\n            print(\"Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed\", word)\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Incorrect. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list using `random.shuffle`, and then joins the list back into a string.\n2. In the `main` function, we define a word to scramble and scramble it using the `scramble_word` function.\n3. We then enter a while loop where we continuously ask the user for input until they correctly unscramble the word.\n4. If the user's input matches the original word (case-insensitive), we print a success message and break out of the loop. Otherwise, we print an error message and ask for input again.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nRun the program and try to unscramble the word. For example, if the scrambled word is \"lloeh\", you would enter \"hello\" to correctly unscramble it.",
