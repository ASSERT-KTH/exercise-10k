  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student given their scores on a series of assignments. It takes the scores as input, calculates the total score, and then computes the average score.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade given a list of scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    average_grade = total_score / len(scores)\n    return average_grade\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of assignments from the user\n    num_assignments = int(input(\"Enter the number of assignments: \"))\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the scores\n    scores = []\n\n    # Get the scores for each assignment from the user\n    for i in range(num_assignments):\n        score = float(input(f\"Enter the score for assignment {i + 1}: \"))\n        scores.append(score)\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores)\n\n    # Print the average grade\n    print(f\"The average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter the number of assignments: 3\n*   Enter the score for assignment 1: 90\n*   Enter the score for assignment 2: 80\n*   Enter the score for assignment 3: 95\n*   The average grade is: 88.33\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The program starts by asking the user for the number of assignments.\n2.  It then prompts the user to enter the score for each assignment, storing the scores in a list.\n3.  The `calculate_average_grade` function takes the list of scores as input, calculates the total score using the `sum` function, and then computes the average score by dividing the total score by the number of assignments.\n4.  The `main` function calls `calculate_average_grade` with the list of scores and prints the result to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This program assumes that the user will enter valid input (i.e., a positive integer for the number of assignments and a numerical value for each score).\n*   You can modify the program to handle invalid input or add additional features, such as calculating the median or standard deviation of the scores.",
