  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        if not guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Convert the input to an integer\n        guess = int(guess)\n        \n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the attempt counter\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n    \n    # Print a success message\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\nThis program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly. It also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer between 1 and 100. After the user guesses the number correctly, it prints a success message along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.",
