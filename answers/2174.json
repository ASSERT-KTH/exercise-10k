  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in %).\n        years (int): The number of years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (principal * rate * years) / 100\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the principal amount\n    while True:\n        try:\n            principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n            if principal <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the interest rate\n    while True:\n        try:\n            rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (%): \"))\n            if rate < 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the number of years\n    while True:\n        try:\n            years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n            if years <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the simple interest\n    interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, years)\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n    print(f\"\\nPrincipal Amount: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {rate}%\")\n    print(f\"Number of Years: {years} years\")\n    print(f\"Simple Interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount when prompted (e.g., `1000`).\n3. Enter the interest rate when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n4. Enter the number of years when prompted (e.g., `2`).\n5. The program will calculate and print the simple interest and total amount.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters valid input for the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years. It also uses an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.",
