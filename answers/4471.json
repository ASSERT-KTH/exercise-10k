  "answer": "**Sum of Squares Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the sum of squares of numbers in a given list using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squares:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `sum_of_squares` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `sum_squares` to 0, which will store the sum of squares.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the input list.\n4. For each number, calculate its square using the exponentiation operator (`** 2`) and add it to `sum_squares`.\n5. After the loop finishes, return the final value of `sum_squares`.\n6. In the example usage, create a list of numbers and pass it to the `sum_of_squares` function.\n7. Print the result to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nSum of squares: 55\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to calculate the sum of squares of numbers in a list using a for loop.",
