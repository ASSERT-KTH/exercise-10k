  "prompt": "Write a program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function:\n\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(numbers):\n    return sorted(numbers)\n\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sort_numbers()` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list. The `sorted()` function is a built-in Python function that sorts the input list in ascending order.\n\nIf you want to implement the sorting algorithm from scratch, you can use a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Quick Sort. Here is an example of a Bubble Sort implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:\n                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]\n    return numbers\n\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nThis program uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list of numbers in ascending order. The outer loop iterates over the list, and the inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.",
