  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the lengths of the legs of a right triangle as input and returns the length of the hypotenuse.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n    double a, b, c;\n    while (scanf(\"%lf%lf\", &a, &b) == 2) {\n        c = sqrt(a * a + b * b);\n        printf(\"%.2f\\n\", c);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary headers, declares the variables, reads the input, calculates the length of the hypotenuse, prints the result, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution. The `while` loop allows the program to process multiple sets of input values.",
