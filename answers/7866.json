  "answer": "Here is an example of a program that calculates the factorial of a number using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using conditional statements.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    else:\n        return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    try:\n        factorial = calculate_factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial using recursion and conditional statements.\n* If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, since the factorial of these numbers is defined as 1.\n* If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError`, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n* For any other positive integer `n`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.\n* The `main` function asks the user to input a number, calculates its factorial, and prints the result. If the input number is negative, it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `5`\n  Output: `The factorial of 5 is 120`\n* Input: `0`\n  Output: `The factorial of 0 is 1`\n* Input: `-3`\n  Output: `Factorial is not defined for negative numbers`",
