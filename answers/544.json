  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the concatenated string.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef concatenate_strings(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two strings as input and returns the concatenated string.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string to be concatenated.\n        str2 (str): The second string to be concatenated.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The concatenated string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return str1 + str2\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = input(\"Enter the first string: \")\n    str2 = input(\"Enter the second string: \")\n    print(\"The concatenated string is: \", concatenate_strings(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `concatenate_strings` function takes two arguments, `str1` and `str2`, which are the strings to be concatenated.\n*   Inside the function, the `+` operator is used to concatenate the two strings. This operator is overloaded for strings in Python to mean concatenation.\n*   The function then returns the concatenated string.\n*   In the example usage, the program asks the user to input two strings, concatenates them using the `concatenate_strings` function, and then prints the result.\n\n### How to Run\n\n1.  Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `concatenate_strings.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program by typing `python concatenate_strings.py` and pressing Enter.\n4.  Follow the prompts to input the two strings.\n5.  The program will print the concatenated string.",
