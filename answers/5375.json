  "answer": "**Array Union Program**\n=======================\n\nHere's a Python program that calculates the union of two or more arrays.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef array_union(*arrays):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the union of two or more arrays.\n    \n    Args:\n        *arrays: Variable number of lists.\n    \n    Returns:\n        A list containing the union of all input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set().union(*arrays))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define example arrays\n    array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    array2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    array3 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n    # Calculate the union of the arrays\n    union = array_union(array1, array2, array3)\n    print(\"Union:\", union)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `array_union` function uses Python's built-in `set` data type to calculate the union of the input arrays. Here's how it works:\n\n1.  The `*arrays` syntax allows the function to accept a variable number of arguments, which are stored in the `arrays` tuple.\n2.  The `set().union(*arrays)` expression calculates the union of all input sets. The `set()` constructor creates an empty set, and the `union` method merges this set with the sets created from the input arrays.\n3.  Finally, the `list()` function converts the resulting set back into a list, which is returned by the `array_union` function.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program with the example arrays, it will output the following:\n\n```\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nThis output shows the union of the three input arrays, which contains all unique elements from the arrays.",
