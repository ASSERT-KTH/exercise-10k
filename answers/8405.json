  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) as input, and then performs the specified operation on the numbers. The program should handle invalid operations and division by zero.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\ndef calc(a, b, c):\n    if c == '+':\n        return a + b\n    elif c == '-':\n        return a - b\n    elif c == '*':\n        return a * b\n    elif c == '/':\n        if b != 0:\n            return a / b\n        else:\n            return \"error\"\n    else:\n        return \"error\"\n\n# Test cases\nprint(calc(10, 2, '+'))  # Output: 12\nprint(calc(10, 2, '-'))  # Output: 8\nprint(calc(10, 2, '*'))  # Output: 20\nprint(calc(10, 2, '/'))  # Output: 5.0\nprint(calc(10, 0, '/'))  # Output: error\nprint(calc(10, 2, '%'))  # Output: error\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they should be filled in with your own information. Also, I've used the `return` statement to provide a value for the `error` cases, as it's not clear what behavior you want to occur in those cases. You may want to consider raising an exception or returning a specific error message instead.",
