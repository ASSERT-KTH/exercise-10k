  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a given list of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n    \n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n    \n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n    print(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_statistics` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n\n1. **Mean Calculation**: The mean is calculated by summing up all the numbers in the list and dividing by the total count of numbers.\n2. **Median Calculation**: The median is calculated using the `statistics.median` function, which returns the middle value in the sorted list. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation is calculated by first calculating the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The standard deviation is then calculated as the square root of the variance.\n\nIn the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_statistics` function with a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The calculated mean, median, and standard deviation are then printed to the console.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element.\n* Consider using a library like NumPy, which provides efficient and accurate implementations of statistical functions.\n* Use meaningful variable names and docstrings to improve code readability and maintainability.",
