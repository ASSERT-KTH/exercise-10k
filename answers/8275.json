  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a series of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, adds them up, and then divides by the total count to get the average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    count = len(numbers)\n    average = total / count\n\n    return average\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns 0.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the count of the numbers using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It calculates the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[90, 80, 70, 85, 95]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[25, 30, 28, 22, 35]`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code in a file named `average_calculator.py`. Run the program using Python: `python average_calculator.py`. The program will output the average of the example list of numbers. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test with different inputs.",
