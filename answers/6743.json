  "answer": "### Declaring a Boolean Variable for Voting Eligibility\n\nHere's an example of how you can declare a boolean variable in Python to represent whether a person is eligible to vote or not:\n\n```python\n# Declare a boolean variable\nis_eligible_to_vote = False\n\n# Example usage:\nage = 18\nis_citizen = True\n\nif age >= 18 and is_citizen:\n    is_eligible_to_vote = True\n\nprint(is_eligible_to_vote)\n```\n\nIn this example, `is_eligible_to_vote` is initially set to `False`. Based on the person's age and citizenship status, the variable is updated to `True` if they meet the voting eligibility criteria.\n\n### Notes\n\n* In most programming languages, boolean variables can be declared using a `bool` data type.\n* Boolean variables can only hold two values: `True` or `False`.\n* The `is_eligible_to_vote` variable can be used in conditional statements to determine the person's voting eligibility.",
