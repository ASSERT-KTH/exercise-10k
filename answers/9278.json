  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return x / y\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic functions as specified, with the `divide` function including a check to raise a `ValueError` if the divisor is zero. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
