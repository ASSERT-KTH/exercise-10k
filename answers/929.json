  "answer": "**Simple Chatbot Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple chatbot program implemented in Python using if/else statements. This program will respond to basic user queries.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to handle user input\ndef chatbot():\n    print(\"Welcome to the simple chatbot!\")\n    print(\"Type 'hello' to start a conversation.\")\n    print(\"Type 'quit' to exit the conversation.\")\n\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \").lower()\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_input == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Bot: Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        # Check for basic greetings\n        elif user_input == \"hello\":\n            print(\"Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?\")\n        elif user_input == \"hi\":\n            print(\"Bot: Hi! What's on your mind?\")\n        elif user_input == \"hey\":\n            print(\"Bot: Hey! How can I help you?\")\n\n        # Check for basic queries\n        elif user_input == \"how are you\":\n            print(\"Bot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!\")\n        elif user_input == \"what is your name\":\n            print(\"Bot: My name is Simple Chatbot.\")\n        elif user_input == \"what can you do\":\n            print(\"Bot: I can have basic conversations and answer simple questions.\")\n\n        # Default response for unknown queries\n        else:\n            print(\"Bot: Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?\")\n\n# Call the chatbot function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    chatbot()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `chatbot.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python chatbot.py` to run the program.\n4. Start interacting with the chatbot by typing your queries.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* User: `hello`\n  Bot: `Hello! How can I assist you today?`\n* User: `how are you`\n  Bot: `I'm doing well, thanks for asking!`\n* User: `what is your name`\n  Bot: `My name is Simple Chatbot.`\n* User: `quit`\n  Bot: `Goodbye!` (exits the conversation)",
