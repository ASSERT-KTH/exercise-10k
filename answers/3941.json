  "prompt": "Write a program to accept a name and age as input and print out a greeting message with the name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a greeting message with the given name and age.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    name (str): The name of the person.\n    age (int): The age of the person.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for the user's name and age, then prints a greeting message.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid age. Please try again.\")\n    \n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_greeting` function takes a `name` and an `age` as input and prints out a greeting message. The `main` function asks the user for their name and age, then calls `print_greeting` with the provided information. \n\nNote that this program includes a simple error check to ensure that the age entered by the user is a valid integer. If the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer, they are asked to try again.",
