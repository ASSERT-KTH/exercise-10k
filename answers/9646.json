We define a `task` function that simulates a task with a given delay.\n2.  The `run_tasks_in_parallel` function creates a pool of worker processes and uses `pool.starmap` to execute the tasks concurrently.\n3.  In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we define a list of tasks and measure the total execution time.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is necessary to prevent the child processes from executing the same code as the parent process.\n*   The `multiprocessing` module uses separate processes, which can lead to higher memory usage compared to threading.\n*   The `pool.starmap` function is used to pass multiple arguments to the `task` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Data processing: Use the `multiprocessing` module to process large datasets in parallel, improving overall performance.\n*   Scientific computing: Utilize parallel processing to speed up computationally intensive tasks, such as simulations or data analysis.\n*   Web scraping: Run multiple web scraping tasks concurrently to fetch data from multiple sources simultaneously.",
