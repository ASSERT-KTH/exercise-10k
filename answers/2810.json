  "answer": "**Word Scramble Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a word\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return ''.join(word_list)\n\ndef check_answer(scrambled_word, correct_word, user_answer):\n    \"\"\"Check if the user's answer is correct\"\"\"\n    if user_answer.lower() == correct_word.lower():\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    words = {\n        \"apple\": \"A type of fruit\",\n        \"car\": \"A type of vehicle\",\n        \"house\": \"A type of building\"\n    }\n\n    # Choose a random word from the dictionary\n    correct_word = random.choice(list(words.keys()))\n\n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(correct_word)\n\n    # Ask the user to unscramble the word\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    print(f\"HINT: {words[correct_word]}\")\n\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n\n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    if check_answer(scrambled_word, correct_word, user_answer):\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer is {correct_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a scrambled word and a hint about the word.\n3. Enter your answer to unscramble the word.\n4. The program will check if your answer is correct and display a message accordingly.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses a dictionary to store words and their corresponding hints.\n* The `scramble_word` function shuffles the letters of the word to scramble it.\n* The `check_answer` function checks if the user's answer is correct by comparing it to the correct word.\n* The `main` function runs the program and asks the user to unscramble the word.",
