  "prompt": "Return a view object that displays a list of all keys in a dictionary.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns a view object displaying all keys in a given dictionary. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef get_dict_keys(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a view object that displays a list of all keys in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict_keys: A view object that displays a list of all keys in the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the built-in keys() method of Python dictionaries to get a view object that displays a list of all keys\n    # This method returns a dict_keys object which is a view object that displays a list of all keys available in a dictionary\n    keys_view = dictionary.keys()\n\n    # Finally, we return the view object\n    return keys_view\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\nprint(get_dict_keys(my_dict))  # Output: dict_keys(['a', 'b', 'c'])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_dict_keys` takes a dictionary as input and first checks if it's indeed a dictionary using `isinstance(dictionary, dict)`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then uses the built-in `keys()` method of Python dictionaries to get a view object that displays a list of all keys, which is stored in `keys_view`.\n* This `keys_view` object is then returned by the function.\n* In the example usage, a dictionary `my_dict` is created and passed to the `get_dict_keys` function, which returns a view object displaying all keys in the dictionary.",
