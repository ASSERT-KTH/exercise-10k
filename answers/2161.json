  "answer": "**Requesting User Input and Printing Sum**\n\nBelow is an example Python code snippet that fulfills the request:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input_and_print_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Request user input for two numbers\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n        # Calculate and print the sum\n        sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_of_numbers}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_user_input_and_print_sum()\n```\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. The code defines a function `get_user_input_and_print_sum` to encapsulate the logic.\n2. It uses `input` to get two numbers from the user and converts them to `float` to handle both integer and decimal inputs.\n3. The sum of the two numbers is calculated and printed.\n4. A `try-except` block is used to catch `ValueError` exceptions that occur if the user enters something that cannot be converted to a number.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures the function runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n- Run the script.\n- Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., `5` and `7`).\n- The script will output the sum of the two numbers (e.g., `The sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is: 12.0`).",
