  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum:\n\n```python\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Take input from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of the two numbers is: \", sum)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. The `main` function takes input from the user, calls `add_numbers` with the input values, and prints the result. \n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter the first number (e.g., `10`).\n3. When prompted again, enter the second number (e.g., `20`).\n4. The program will print the sum of the two numbers (e.g., `The sum of the two numbers is: 30.0`).",
