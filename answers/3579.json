  "answer": "### Symmetric Difference Between Two Dictionaries\n#### Problem Description\nThe symmetric difference between two dictionaries is a dictionary that contains all the keys that are in exactly one of the two dictionaries.\n\n#### Solution\nHere is a Python function that calculates the symmetric difference between two dictionaries:\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary that contains all the keys that are in exactly one of the two input dictionaries.\n\n    :param dict1: The first dictionary.\n    :param dict2: The second dictionary.\n    :return: A dictionary containing the symmetric difference.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find keys that are in dict1 but not in dict2\n    dict1_unique_keys = {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key not in dict2}\n    \n    # Find keys that are in dict2 but not in dict1\n    dict2_unique_keys = {key: dict2[key] for key in dict2 if key not in dict1}\n    \n    # Combine the two dictionaries\n    symmetric_diff = {**dict1_unique_keys, **dict2_unique_keys}\n    \n    return symmetric_diff\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nresult = symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2)\nprint(result)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}\n```\nThis function works by first finding the keys that are unique to each dictionary, and then combining these keys into a single dictionary.\n\n#### Alternative Solution\nAlternatively, you can use the `set` data structure to find the symmetric difference of the keys, and then use a dictionary comprehension to create the resulting dictionary:\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary that contains all the keys that are in exactly one of the two input dictionaries.\n\n    :param dict1: The first dictionary.\n    :param dict2: The second dictionary.\n    :return: A dictionary containing the symmetric difference.\n    \"\"\"\n    symmetric_diff_keys = (set(dict1.keys()) - set(dict2.keys())) | (set(dict2.keys()) - set(dict1.keys()))\n    symmetric_diff = {key: dict1.get(key, dict2.get(key)) for key in symmetric_diff_keys}\n    \n    return symmetric_diff\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nresult = symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2)\nprint(result)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}\n```\nThis solution is more concise, but it assumes that the values associated with the same key in both dictionaries are the same. If this is not the case, the value from the first dictionary will be used.",
