  "answer": "Here is a Python implementation of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the list of numbers, starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        # Store the current element to be inserted\n        current_element = numbers[i]\n\n        # Initialize a pointer to the previous element\n        j = i - 1\n\n        # Shift elements greater than the current element to the right\n        while j >= 0 and numbers[j] > current_element:\n            numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j]\n            j -= 1\n\n        # Insert the current element at its correct position\n        numbers[j + 1] = current_element\n\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", insertion_sort(numbers))\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The `insertion_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  It iterates over the list, starting from the second element (index 1).\n3.  For each element, it compares it with the elements before it and shifts those elements to the right until it finds the correct position to insert the current element.\n4.  Once the correct position is found, it inserts the current element at that position.\n5.  The process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n\n**Time complexity:**\n\n*   Best-case: O(n) when the input list is already sorted.\n*   Worst-case: O(n^2) when the input list is sorted in reverse order.\n\n**Space complexity:** O(1) as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the current element and the pointer.",
