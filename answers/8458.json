  "answer": "**Finding the Remainder of an Integer Division Operation**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that calculates the remainder of an integer division operation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the remainder of an integer division operation.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_remainder` that takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, as input.\n*   Inside the function, we check if the `divisor` is zero and raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if it is, because division by zero is undefined.\n*   We use the modulus operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of the division operation and return the result.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `calculate_remainder` with an example.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe remainder of 17 divided by 5 is 2\n```\n\nThis indicates that the remainder of 17 divided by 5 is indeed 2.",
