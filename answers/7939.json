  "answer": "**Energy Calculation Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the energy of an object given its mass and velocity. The energy of an object can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (1/2) \\* m \\* v^2\n\nwhere:\n- E is the energy of the object\n- m is the mass of the object\n- v is the velocity of the object\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_energy(mass, velocity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energy of an object given its mass and velocity.\n\n    Args:\n        mass (float): The mass of the object in kg.\n        velocity (float): The velocity of the object in m/s.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The energy of the object in Joules.\n    \"\"\"\n    energy = 0.5 * mass * (velocity ** 2)\n    return energy\n\ndef main():\n    mass = float(input(\"Enter the mass of the object in kg: \"))\n    velocity = float(input(\"Enter the velocity of the object in m/s: \"))\n\n    energy = calculate_energy(mass, velocity)\n    print(f\"The energy of the object is {energy} Joules.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the mass of the object in kg when prompted.\n3. Enter the velocity of the object in m/s when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the energy of the object in Joules.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This program uses the formula for kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.\n- The program assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., non-negative and numeric).\n- The program does not handle invalid input values. You may want to add error handling depending on your specific requirements.",
