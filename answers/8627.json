  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a list of characters as input, and returns the shortest substring that contains all the characters.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the sliding window technique to find the shortest substring that contains all the given characters:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef shortest_substring(s, chars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the shortest substring of `s` that contains all characters in `chars`.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n        chars (list): A list of characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The shortest substring that contains all characters in `chars`. If no such substring exists, returns an empty string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s or not chars:\n        return \"\"\n\n    char_count = Counter(chars)\n    required_chars = len(char_count)\n\n    left = 0\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    min_substring = \"\"\n\n    formed_chars = 0\n    window_counts = {}\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        character = s[right]\n        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1\n\n        if character in char_count and window_counts[character] == char_count[character]:\n            formed_chars += 1\n\n        while left <= right and formed_chars == required_chars:\n            character = s[left]\n\n            if right - left + 1 < min_length:\n                min_length = right - left + 1\n                min_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n            window_counts[character] -= 1\n            if character in char_count and window_counts[character] < char_count[character]:\n                formed_chars -= 1\n\n            left += 1\n\n    return min_substring\n\n# Example usage:\ns = \"abcba\"\nchars = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nprint(shortest_substring(s, chars))  # Output: \"abc\"\n```\n\nThis program works by maintaining a sliding window over the input string. The window is defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` is the starting index of the window and `right` is the ending index. The program expands the window to the right by moving the `right` pointer, and contracts the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer.\n\nThe program uses two counters: `char_count` to count the occurrences of each character in the `chars` list, and `window_counts` to count the occurrences of each character in the current window. The `formed_chars` variable keeps track of the number of characters in `char_count` that have been formed in the current window.\n\nWhen the window contains all characters in `chars`, the program checks if the current window is the shortest substring that contains all characters. If it is, the program updates the `min_length` and `min_substring` variables. The program then contracts the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer, and updates the `window_counts` and `formed_chars` variables accordingly.\n\nFinally, the program returns the shortest substring that contains all characters in `chars`. If no such substring exists, the program returns an empty string.",
