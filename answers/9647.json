  "answer": "**Concurrent Task Execution using Threading**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that leverages the `threading` module to execute tasks concurrently.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\nfrom random import randint\n\ndef execute_task(task_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a task by sleeping for a random duration between 1 and 5 seconds.\n    \n    Args:\n        task_name (str): The name of the task being executed.\n    \"\"\"\n    sleep_duration = randint(1, 5)\n    print(f\"Task '{task_name}' started. Sleeping for {sleep_duration} seconds.\")\n    time.sleep(sleep_duration)\n    print(f\"Task '{task_name}' completed.\")\n\ndef run_tasks_concurrently(task_names):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a list of tasks concurrently using the threading module.\n    \n    Args:\n        task_names (list): A list of task names to be executed concurrently.\n    \"\"\"\n    threads = []\n    \n    # Create and start a thread for each task\n    for task_name in task_names:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=execute_task, args=(task_name,))\n        threads.append(thread)\n        thread.start()\n    \n    # Wait for all threads to complete\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    task_names = [\"Task A\", \"Task B\", \"Task C\", \"Task D\"]\n    start_time = time.time()\n    run_tasks_concurrently(task_names)\n    end_time = time.time()\n    print(f\"Total execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `execute_task` function simulates a task by sleeping for a random duration between 1 and 5 seconds.\n2.  The `run_tasks_concurrently` function takes a list of task names, creates a thread for each task, and starts the threads.\n3.  The `threading.Thread` constructor is used to create a new thread, passing the `execute_task` function as the target and the task name as an argument.\n4.  The `start` method is called to start each thread.\n5.  The `join` method is called to wait for each thread to complete, ensuring that the main program waits for all tasks to finish before exiting.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIn the example usage section, we define a list of task names (`task_names`) and measure the total execution time by calling the `run_tasks_concurrently` function. The output will show the start and completion of each task, along with the total execution time.",
