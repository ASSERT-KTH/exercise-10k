  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += i\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = calculate_sum(num)\n    print(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {num} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`.\n*   Inside the `calculate_sum` function, we initialize a variable `total` to 0. We then use a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), adding each number to `total`.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter a number, calculate the sum using the `calculate_sum` function, and print the result.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nAlternatively, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum in constant time:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = calculate_sum(num)\n    print(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {num} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` to calculate the sum directly, without needing a loop. This approach is more efficient for large inputs.",
