  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of an Array**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the average of all numbers in an array.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of all numbers in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(array) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array cannot be empty\")\n\n    return sum(array) / len(array)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes an array as input and checks if it's empty.\n2. If the array is not empty, it calculates the sum of all numbers using the built-in `sum` function.\n3. It then divides the sum by the length of the array (i.e., the number of elements) to get the average.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example array.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* This program assumes that the input array only contains numbers. If the array can contain other types of data, you may need to add additional error checking.\n* The program raises a `ValueError` if the input array is empty, as the average of an empty array is undefined.",
