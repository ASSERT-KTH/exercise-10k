  "answer": "**Game Show Simulator**\n==========================\n\nThis program simulates a simple game show where the user is asked a series of questions. The user's answers are evaluated using if statements to determine the winner.\n\n**Code**\n```python\n# Game Show Simulator\n\n# Initialize score and question counter\nscore = 0\nquestion_counter = 1\n\n# Question 1\nprint(f\"Question {question_counter}: What is the capital of France?\")\nanswer1 = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\nif answer1.lower() == \"paris\":\n    score += 1\n    print(\"Correct!\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is Paris.\\n\")\nquestion_counter += 1\n\n# Question 2\nprint(f\"Question {question_counter}: Which planet is the largest in our solar system?\")\nanswer2 = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\nif answer2.lower() == \"jupiter\":\n    score += 1\n    print(\"Correct!\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is Jupiter.\\n\")\nquestion_counter += 1\n\n# Question 3\nprint(f\"Question {question_counter}: Who painted the famous painting 'The Starry Night'?\")\nanswer3 = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\nif answer3.lower() == \"vincent van gogh\":\n    score += 1\n    print(\"Correct!\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is Vincent Van Gogh.\\n\")\nquestion_counter += 1\n\n# Determine the winner\nif score >= 2:\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You won with a score of {score} out of 3.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Sorry, you lost with a score of {score} out of 3. Better luck next time!\")\n```\n\n**How to Run**\n---------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `game_show.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python game_show.py` to run the program.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and answer the questions correctly to win.\n* Run the program and answer some or all of the questions incorrectly to lose.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* You can modify the questions and answers to create your own custom game show.\n* You can add more questions or features, such as a timer or scoring system, to make the game more challenging and engaging.",
