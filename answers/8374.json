  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef horner_polynomial_evaluation(coefficients, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate a polynomial of a given degree with given coefficients at a given point using Horner's method.\n\n    Parameters:\n    coefficients (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial, where coefficients[i] is the coefficient of x^i.\n    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The value of the polynomial at the given point.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for coefficient in reversed(coefficients):\n        result = result * x + coefficient\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ncoefficients = [1, 2, 3]  # corresponds to the polynomial 1 + 2x + 3x^2\nx = 2.0\nresult = horner_polynomial_evaluation(coefficients, x)\nprint(f\"The value of the polynomial at x = {x} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `horner_polynomial_evaluation` takes two parameters: `coefficients` and `x`. The `coefficients` parameter is a list of coefficients of the polynomial, where `coefficients[i]` is the coefficient of `x^i`. The `x` parameter is the point at which to evaluate the polynomial.\n*   The function initializes a variable `result` to 0 and then iterates over the coefficients in reverse order. In each iteration, it updates the `result` using the formula `result = result * x + coefficient`, which is the core of Horner's method.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `result`, which is the value of the polynomial at the given point.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the degree of the polynomial. This is because the function iterates over the coefficients once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the function is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input, making it very efficient.",
