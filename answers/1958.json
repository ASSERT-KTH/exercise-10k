  "answer": "**Variance Calculation Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the variance of a given list of numbers. The variance is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data from its mean value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_variance(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        data (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not data:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Calculate the mean of the input list\n    mean = statistics.mean(data)\n\n    # Calculate the variance using the formula: variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2) / (n - 1)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / (len(data) - 1)\n\n    return variance\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    variance = calculate_variance(data)\n    print(f\"Variance: {variance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the input list.\n2. The variance is calculated using the formula: `variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2) / (n - 1)`, where `x` is each data point, `mean` is the mean of the data, and `n` is the number of data points.\n3. The program checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n4. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `calculate_variance` function with a sample list of numbers.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program calculates the sample variance, which is used when the input list is a sample of a larger population. If you want to calculate the population variance, you can modify the formula to `variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2) / n`.",
