Create a counter for the characters in the given string `t`.\n2.  Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum window substring and its length.\n3.  Iterate over the string `s` using a sliding window approach.\n4.  For each character in the window, increment its count in the window counter.\n5.  If the character is in `t` and its count in the window is equal to its count in `t`, increment the `formed` counter.\n6.  While the window contains all characters of `t`, update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller.\n7.  Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counter and decrement the `formed` counter if necessary.\n8.  Move the left pointer to the right and repeat the process until the end of the string `s` is reached.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating over the string `s` once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string `t`. This is because we are storing the characters of the string `t` in a counter.",
