  "answer": "**Meal Cost Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip based on the meal cost and tip percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal including the tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n    print(f\"The total cost of the meal with a {tip_percentage}% tip is: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal (e.g., 25.00).\n3. Enter the tip percentage (e.g., 15).\n4. The program will display the total cost of the meal including the tip.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_total_cost` function takes the meal cost and tip percentage as input and returns the total cost.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_total_cost` function, and displays the result.\n* The program uses Python's built-in `input` function to get user input and `float` to convert the input to a floating-point number.\n* The program uses an f-string to format the output with two decimal places.",
