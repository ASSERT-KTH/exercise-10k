  "prompt": "Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. The program should take an integer n as input and output the Fibonacci sequence as a list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(fibonacci(n))\n```\nThis code defines the `fibonacci` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. It also includes a main program that asks the user to enter a number, calls the `fibonacci` function with that number, and prints the resulting Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThe `fibonacci` function uses the base cases and recursive case described in the specification to generate the Fibonacci sequence. It handles the cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2 separately, and uses a loop to generate the rest of the sequence.\n\nNote that I used `int(input(...))` to read the user's input as an integer, as specified in the requirements. I also used `print(fibonacci(n))` to print the resulting Fibonacci sequence, as specified in the requirements.",
