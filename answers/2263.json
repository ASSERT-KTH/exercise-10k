  "prompt": "Write a program that divides two numbers and returns the quotient and remainder.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two parameters: `dividend` and `divisor`. It returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n\nThe `main` function provides example usage of `divide_numbers`, attempting to divide 17 by 5 and print the result. If the divisor is zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message instead.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Integer Division (`//`)**: In Python, the `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the quotient without the remainder.\n2. **Modulus Operator (`%`)**: The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division.\n3. **Error Handling**: The program checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero. It also catches and handles this error in the `main` function.",
