  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a year and checks if it's a leap year. If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it's divisible by 400, then it's a leap year",
  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100: `2020`\n*   Enter a year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400: `2100`\n*   Enter a year that is divisible by 400: `2000`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The `is_leap_year` function checks if a year is a leap year by applying the leap year rules.\n2.  The `main` function gets a year from the user, checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `leap_year.py`), then run it using Python (e.g., `python leap_year.py`). Follow the prompt to enter a year, and the program will tell you if it's a leap year or not.",
