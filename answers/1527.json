  "answer": "**Binary Search Implementation**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current search interval.\n3.  Compare the element at the midpoint index to the target element.\n    *   If they match, return the midpoint index.\n    *   If the midpoint element is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1`.\n    *   If the midpoint element is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1`.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until the search interval is empty (`low > high`).\n5.  If the target element is not found, return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the search interval is divided in half at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the target element.",
