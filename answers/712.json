  "answer": "**Converting a Dictionary to a List of Tuples**\n======================================================\n\nYou can use the `items()` method of dictionaries in Python, which returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef dict_to_list_of_tuples(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a dictionary to a list of tuples.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to convert.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(input_dict.items())\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n    result = dict_to_list_of_tuples(example_dict)\n    print(result)  # Output: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `dict_to_list_of_tuples` function takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of tuples.\n*   The `items()` method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.\n*   We convert the view object to a list using the `list()` function.\n*   In the example usage, we create a dictionary `example_dict` and pass it to the `dict_to_list_of_tuples` function.\n*   The resulting list of tuples is printed to the console.\n\nNote: The order of the tuples in the list is not guaranteed to be the same as the order of the key-value pairs in the dictionary, as dictionaries are inherently unordered in Python versions before 3.7. However, in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain their insertion order, so the order of the tuples in the list will match the order of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.",
