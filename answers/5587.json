  "answer": "### Difference Function\n#### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the difference between two numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1: float, num2: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 10.0\n    num2 = 5.0\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_difference` takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, both of type `float`.\n*   It returns the difference between `num1` and `num2` by subtracting `num2` from `num1`.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with two numbers and print the result.",
