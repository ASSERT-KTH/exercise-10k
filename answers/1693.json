  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, checks if the list is not empty, and returns the average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the list of numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the list is: {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is not empty. If it is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_average` function with a sample list of numbers.\n7. We handle the `ValueError` exception that may be raised if the input list is empty.",
