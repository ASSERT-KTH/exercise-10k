  "answer": "**Calculating the Surface Area of a Sphere**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is `4 * \u03c0 * r^2`, where `r` is the radius of the sphere.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_surface_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = 5.0\n    surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)\n    print(f\"The surface area of the sphere with radius {radius} is {surface_area:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_surface_area` function takes the radius as input and returns the calculated surface area.\n*   The function checks if the radius is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The surface area is calculated using the formula `4 * \u03c0 * r^2`.\n*   The `main` function provides an example usage of the `calculate_surface_area` function.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `sphere_surface_area.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python sphere_surface_area.py`). The program will calculate and print the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 5.0. You can modify the `radius` variable in the `main` function to test with different radii.",
