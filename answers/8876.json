  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Current Date]\n# Purpose: Calculate the power of a number\n\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the power of a number.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = base ** exponent\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(power(2, 3))  # Output: 8\nprint(power(2, 4))  # Output: 16\nprint(power(2, 5))  # Output: 32\n```\nNote that I've left out the author's name and date, as those would be specific to the individual writing the code. You can fill those in as needed. Also, I've used the `**` operator to calculate the power, as it is the most straightforward and efficient way to do so in Python.",
