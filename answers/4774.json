  "prompt": "Write a program that determines the winner of a game based on the scores. If the user's score is higher than the computer's score, the user wins. If the computer's score is higher than the user's score, the computer wins. If the scores are tied, the game is a tie.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(user_score, computer_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner of a game based on the scores.\n\n    Args:\n        user_score (int): The user's score.\n        computer_score (int): The computer's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The result of the game.\n    \"\"\"\n    if user_score > computer_score:\n        return \"User wins!\"\n    elif user_score < computer_score:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n\ndef main():\n    user_score = int(input(\"Enter the user's score: \"))\n    computer_score = int(input(\"Enter the computer's score: \"))\n\n    result = determine_winner(user_score, computer_score)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `determine_winner` function takes two arguments, `user_score` and `computer_score`, and returns a string indicating the result of the game.\n*   Inside the `determine_winner` function, we use an `if-elif-else` statement to compare the scores and determine the winner.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter the scores and then call the `determine_winner` function with the entered scores.\n*   Finally, we print the result of the game.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters a score of 10 and the computer's score is 5, the program will output \"User wins!\".\n*   If the user enters a score of 5 and the computer's score is 10, the program will output \"Computer wins!\".\n*   If the user enters a score of 10 and the computer's score is also 10, the program will output \"It's a tie!\".",
