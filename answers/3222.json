  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* This program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they find the correct number or type \"quit\".\n* The `random.randint` function is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n* The `input` function is used to get the user's guess, and the `int` function is used to convert the user's guess to an integer.\n* The program checks if the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low, and prints a message accordingly.",
