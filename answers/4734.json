  "prompt": "Write a function that uses the map function to apply a given function to each element of a list.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll provide a function that utilizes the map function to apply a given function to each element of a list, along with a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef square(num):\n    return num ** 2\n\ndef apply_function(func, lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to each element of a list using the map function.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        lst (list): The list of elements to apply the function to.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with the results of applying the function to each element.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We use the map function to apply the given function to each element of the list.\n    # The map function returns a map object, which is an iterator, so we convert it to a list.\n    mapped_list = list(map(func, lst))\n    \n    # We return the new list with the results of applying the function to each element.\n    return mapped_list\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquares = apply_function(square, numbers)\nprint(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes in a function `func` and a list `lst` as arguments, allowing for flexibility in the type of function applied to the list.\n* The `map` function is used to apply `func` to each element of `lst`, returning a map object that is then converted to a list `mapped_list`.\n* The function returns `mapped_list`, which contains the results of applying `func` to each element of `lst`.\n* In the example usage, the `square` function is applied to a list of numbers, demonstrating how to use the `apply_function` to perform a specific operation on a list.",
