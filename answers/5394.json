  "answer": "**Finding the Index of an Element in a List**\n====================================================\n\nHere is a Python function that finds the index of a given element in a list. If the element is not found, it returns -1.\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a given element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        element: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(element)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(numbers, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(numbers, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you want to implement the function manually without using the built-in `index` method, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and return the index when the element is found.\n\n```python\ndef find_index_manual(lst, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a given element in a list (manual implementation).\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        element: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n        if x == element:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index_manual(numbers, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index_manual(numbers, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nNote that the manual implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, whereas the built-in `index` method is implemented in C and has a faster time complexity. Therefore, the first implementation is generally preferred unless you have a specific reason to use the manual implementation.",
