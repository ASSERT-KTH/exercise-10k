  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates a student's grade based on their score using if/else statements:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (out of 100): \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate the grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n\n        # Print the grade\n        print(f\"The student's grade is {grade}.\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the student's score from the user and validates it to ensure it's between 0 and 100.\n3. If the score is valid, the `main` function calls the `calculate_grade` function to calculate the grade and prints the result.\n4. The program uses if/else statements to determine the grade based on the score:\n\t* A: 90-100\n\t* B: 80-89\n\t* C: 70-79\n\t* D: 60-69\n\t* F: Below 60\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\nEnter the student's score (out of 100): 85\nThe student's grade is B.\n```",
