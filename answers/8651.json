  "answer": "**List Difference Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the difference between two given lists. The difference is defined as the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list, and the elements that are present in the second list but not in the first list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef list_difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements that are in list1 but not in list2,\n               and the second list contains elements that are in list2 but not in list1.\n    \"\"\"\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n\n    # Calculate the difference between the two sets\n    diff1 = list(set1 - set2)\n    diff2 = list(set2 - set1)\n\n    return diff1, diff2\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n    diff1, diff2 = list_difference(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Elements in list1 but not in list2:\", diff1)\n    print(\"Elements in list2 but not in list1:\", diff2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two lists as input and converts them into sets.\n2. It calculates the difference between the two sets using the `-` operator.\n3. The differences are converted back into lists and returned as a tuple.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nElements in list1 but not in list2: [1, 2]\nElements in list2 but not in list1: [5, 6]\n```",
