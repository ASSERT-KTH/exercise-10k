  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", sum_of_numbers)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `add_numbers` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers using the `input` function.\n*   The `float` function is used to convert the input strings to floating-point numbers, allowing the program to handle decimal numbers.\n*   The `add_numbers` function is called with the two input numbers, and the result is stored in the `sum_of_numbers` variable.\n*   Finally, the program prints the sum of the two numbers to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter two numbers when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 5\nEnter the second number: 7\nThe sum of the two numbers is: 12.0\n```\n\nThis program can be used to add any two numbers, including decimal numbers.",
