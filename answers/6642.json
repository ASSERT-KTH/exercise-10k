  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that utilizes documentation to provide a clear description of its purpose and usage, making it easier for users to understand how to implement it effectively. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates a greeting message for a given name.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A greeting message including the provided name.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a string.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> greet(\"John\")\n        'Hello, John!'\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n\n# Test the function\nprint(greet(\"John\"))  # Outputs: Hello, John!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `greet` is defined with a parameter `name` of type `str` and returns a greeting message as a `str`. It includes a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.\n* The docstring provides an `Args` section to detail the expected input, a `Returns` section to explain the output, and a `Raises` section to warn about potential errors, such as a `TypeError` if the input is not a string.\n* The function checks if the input `name` is a string using `isinstance(name, str)`, raising a `TypeError` if it's not, ensuring the function is used correctly.\n* An example usage of the function is provided in the docstring, demonstrating how to call the function with a name, such as `greet(\"John\")`, and what the expected output would be, which is `'Hello, John!'`.",
