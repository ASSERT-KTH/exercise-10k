  "answer": "**Calculating the Volume of a Cube**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    return side_length ** 3\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    side_length = 5\n    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_cube_volume` takes one argument, `side_length`, which is the length of a side of the cube.\n*   It checks if the `side_length` is negative, and if so, it raises a `ValueError` because a side length cannot be negative.\n*   It then calculates the volume of the cube by cubing the `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n*   The result is returned by the function.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_cube_volume` function by calculating the volume of a cube with a side length of 5 and printing the result.",
