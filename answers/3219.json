  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the average of its digits.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of the digits of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef average_of_digits(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit\n    str_num = str(num)\n    \n    # Initialize sum and count of digits\n    sum_of_digits = 0\n    count_of_digits = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character (digit) in the string\n    for digit in str_num:\n        # Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the sum\n        sum_of_digits += int(digit)\n        # Increment the count of digits\n        count_of_digits += 1\n    \n    # Check if the number has any digits\n    if count_of_digits == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Calculate and return the average of the digits\n        return sum_of_digits / count_of_digits\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The average of the digits is:\", average_of_digits(num))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `average_of_digits` function takes an integer `num` as input.\n2. **String Conversion**: The number is converted to a string to easily iterate over each digit.\n3. **Sum and Count Initialization**: Variables are initialized to keep track of the sum of digits and the count of digits.\n4. **Digit Iteration**: Each character (digit) in the string is converted back to an integer, added to the sum, and the count is incremented.\n5. **Average Calculation**: After iterating over all digits, the average is calculated by dividing the sum of digits by the count of digits.\n6. **Handling Zero-Digit Numbers**: If the input number has no digits (which should not happen with the current input method but is checked for robustness), the function returns 0.\n7. **Input and Output**: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the average of its digits is printed out.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- **Positive Integer**: Input `123`, output `2.0` (since (1+2+3)/3 = 2.0).\n- **Negative Integer**: Input `-456`, output `5.0` (since the function treats the number as `456` for calculation purposes, (4+5+6)/3 = 5.0).\n- **Single Digit**: Input `7`, output `7.0` (since the average of a single digit is the digit itself).",
