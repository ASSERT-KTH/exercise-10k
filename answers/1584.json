  "prompt": "Create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user should be able to choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the program should generate a random choice and determine the winner.",
  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"Rock\" and computer_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Scissors\" and computer_choice == \"Paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Paper\" and computer_choice == \"Rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors) or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()\n        if user_choice not in [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer.\n2. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game rules.\n3. The `main` function plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It prompts the user for their choice, generates a random choice for the computer, and determines the winner.\n4. The game continues until the user chooses to quit.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors) or 'q' to quit: Rock\n\nYou chose: Rock\nComputer chose: Scissors\n\nYou win!\n\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors) or 'q' to quit: \n```",
