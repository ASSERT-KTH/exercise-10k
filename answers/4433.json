  "answer": "Here is a Python program that manages a bank account using a for loop to display transactions and a while loop to handle user input:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.balance = balance\n        self.transactions = []\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        self.transactions.append(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            self.transactions.append(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}\")\n\n    def display_transactions(self):\n        print(\"Transaction History:\")\n        for i, transaction in enumerate(self.transactions):\n            print(f\"{i+1}. {transaction}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(\"1234567890\", 1000)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1.
