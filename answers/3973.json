  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum gap between two adjacent elements in a sorted array of integers. The program should take a sorted array of integers as input and output the maximum gap.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in Python that follows the given specifications:\n\n```python\ndef maximumGap(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 2 or min(nums) == max(nums):\n        return 0\n\n    min_val = min(nums)\n    max_val = max(nums)\n    bucket_size = max(1, (max_val - min_val) // (len(nums) - 1))\n    bucket_num = (max_val - min_val) // bucket_size + 1\n    buckets = [[float('inf'), float('-inf')] for _ in range(bucket_num)]\n\n    for num in nums:\n        index = (num - min_val) // bucket_size\n        buckets[index][0] = min(buckets[index][0], num)\n        buckets[index][1] = max(buckets[index][1], num)\n\n    max_gap = 0\n    prev_max = buckets[0][1]\n    for i in range(1, bucket_num):\n        if buckets[i][0] != float('inf'):\n            max_gap = max(max_gap, buckets[i][0] - prev_max)\n            prev_max = buckets[i][1]\n\n    return max_gap\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [3, 6, 9, 1]\nprint(maximumGap(nums))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis code first checks if the input array `nums` has less than 2 elements or if all elements are the same. If either condition is true, it returns 0.\n\nIt then calculates the minimum and maximum values in the array, as well as the bucket size. The bucket size is the maximum gap between two adjacent elements in the array, which is calculated as `(max_val - min_val) // (len(nums) - 1)`. If the bucket size is 0, it is set to 1.\n\nThe code then creates `bucket_num` empty buckets, where `bucket_num` is the number of buckets needed to cover the entire range of the array. Each bucket is represented as a list of two elements: the minimum and maximum values in that bucket.\n\nIt then iterates over the input array and assigns each element to its corresponding bucket. For each element, it updates the minimum and maximum values in its bucket.\n\nFinally, it iterates over the buckets and calculates the maximum gap between two adjacent non-empty buckets. The maximum gap is the maximum difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket.\n\nThe code returns the maximum gap found.\n\nIn the example usage, the input array `[3, 6, 9, 1]` is sorted to `[1, 3, 6, 9]`, and the maximum gap is calculated as 3, which is the gap between 3 and 6.",
