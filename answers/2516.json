  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = np.mean(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = np.median(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    std_dev = np.std(numbers)\n\n    return {\n        \"mean\": mean,\n        \"median\": median,\n        \"standard_deviation\": std_dev\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    stats = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Statistics:\")\n    print(f\"Mean: {stats['mean']}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {stats['median']}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {stats['standard_deviation']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n2. The `np.mean`, `np.median`, and `np.std` functions from the NumPy library are used to calculate the respective statistics.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_statistics` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the statistics of a list of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`\n* Calculate the statistics of a list of stock prices: `[100.0, 120.0, 110.0, 130.0, 105.0]`\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the NumPy library, which is a popular library for numerical computing in Python.\n* The `np.std` function calculates the population standard deviation by default. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation, you can pass `ddof=1` as an argument, like this: `np.std(numbers, ddof=1)`.",
