  "answer": "**Profile Summary Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a person's name, age, and occupation as input and prints out a profile summary.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_profile_info():\n    \"\"\"Get person's profile information\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    occupation = input(\"Enter your occupation: \")\n    return name, age, occupation\n\ndef print_profile_summary(name, age, occupation):\n    \"\"\"Print person's profile summary\"\"\"\n    print(\"\\nProfile Summary:\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    print(f\"Name: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Age: {age}\")\n    print(f\"Occupation: {occupation}\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age, occupation = get_profile_info()\n    print_profile_summary(name, age, occupation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name, age, and occupation. After entering the information, it will print out a profile summary.\n\n```\nEnter your name: John Doe\nEnter your age: 30\nEnter your occupation: Software Engineer\n\nProfile Summary:\n----------------\nName: John Doe\nAge: 30\nOccupation: Software Engineer\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_profile_info` function prompts the user to enter their name, age, and occupation, and returns the input values.\n2. The `print_profile_summary` function takes the name, age, and occupation as input and prints out a profile summary.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_profile_info` to get the profile information and then calls `print_profile_summary` to print the summary.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.",
