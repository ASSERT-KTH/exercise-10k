  "answer": "**Mode Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. This program calculates the mode of a set of numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a set of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes (in case of multiple modes).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    frequency = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number.\n3. It finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the frequency values.\n4. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency by using a list comprehension.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_mode` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the mode of a set of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 85, 85, 90, 92]`\n* Calculate the mode of a set of product prices: `[10.99, 12.99, 9.99, 10.99, 12.99, 9.99]`\n\nNote: If there are multiple modes (i.e., multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency), the program returns a list of all modes.",
