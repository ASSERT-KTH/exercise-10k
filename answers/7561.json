  "prompt": "Create a function that returns another function, which has access to the outer function's scope.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns another function, which has access to the outer function's scope, and provide a clear explanation of the solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# We start by defining our outer function. This function will return another function.\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns another function, which has access to the outer function's scope.\n\n    Args:\n        outer_variable (str): A variable from the outer function's scope.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that has access to the outer function's scope.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Now, we define our inner function. This function will have access to the outer function's scope.\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        # We can use the outer_variable inside the inner function, even though it's not defined here.\n        # This is because the inner function has access to the outer function's scope.\n        print(f\"Outer variable: {outer_variable}\")\n        print(f\"Inner variable: {inner_variable}\")\n\n    # Finally, we return the inner function from the outer function.\n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\n# We call the outer function with an argument, and store the returned function in a variable.\nreturned_function = outer_function(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n# Now, we can call the returned function with its own argument.\nreturned_function(\"This is the inner variable.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `outer_function` takes an `outer_variable` as an argument and returns the `inner_function`. This allows the `inner_function` to access the `outer_function`'s scope.\n* The `inner_function` can use the `outer_variable` and its own `inner_variable` to perform operations, demonstrating its access to both its own scope and the outer function's scope.\n* When the `outer_function` is called, it returns the `inner_function`, which can then be called with its own argument, as shown in the example usage.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to call the `outer_function` with an argument, store the returned function in a variable, and then call the returned function with its own argument.",
