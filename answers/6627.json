  "answer": "**Higher-Order Function: Applying a Function to a List of Numbers**\n===========================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a higher-order function written in Python. This function, `apply_to_list`, takes another function and a list of numbers as arguments, applies the given function to each number in the list, and returns a new list with the results.\n\n```python\ndef apply_to_list(func, numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to each number in a list and returns a new list with the results.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to apply to each number.\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with the results of applying the function to each number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [func(num) for num in numbers]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef square(x):\n    \"\"\"Returns the square of a number.\"\"\"\n    return x ** 2\n\ndef double(x):\n    \"\"\"Returns twice a number.\"\"\"\n    return 2 * x\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nsquared_numbers = apply_to_list(square, numbers)\nprint(\"Squared numbers:\", squared_numbers)\n\ndoubled_numbers = apply_to_list(double, numbers)\nprint(\"Doubled numbers:\", doubled_numbers)\n```\n\n**How It Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `apply_to_list` function is defined with two parameters: `func` (the function to apply) and `numbers` (the list of numbers).\n2. Inside `apply_to_list`, a list comprehension is used to apply `func` to each number `num` in `numbers`.\n3. The results of applying `func` to each number are collected in a new list, which is then returned.\n4. Example functions `square` and `double` are defined to demonstrate how `apply_to_list` can be used with different functions.\n5. A list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is created to test `apply_to_list` with both `square` and `double` functions.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nSquared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nDoubled numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```",
