  "prompt": "Define and use an enumeration data type to represent a set of named values.",
  "answer": "**Enumeration Data Type**\n==========================\n\nAn enumeration is a data type that consists of a set of named values. Enumerations are useful when a variable can only take on a specific set of distinct values.\n\n**Example: Days of the Week**\n-----------------------------\n\nHere is an example of an enumeration data type in Python to represent the days of the week:\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass DayOfWeek(Enum):\n    MONDAY = 1\n    TUESDAY = 2\n    WEDNESDAY = 3\n    THURSDAY = 4\n    FRIDAY = 5\n    SATURDAY = 6\n    SUNDAY = 7\n\n# Using the enumeration\nday = DayOfWeek.MONDAY\nprint(day)  # Output: DayOfWeek.MONDAY\nprint(day.name)  # Output: MONDAY\nprint(day.value)  # Output: 1\n\n# Iterating over the enumeration\nfor day in DayOfWeek:\n    print(f\"{day.name}: {day.value}\")\n```\nIn this example, we define an enumeration `DayOfWeek` with seven named values, each representing a day of the week. We can then use these named values in our code, and access their names and values using the `name` and `value` attributes.\n\n**Benefits of Enumerations**\n---------------------------\n\nUsing enumerations provides several benefits, including:\n\n*   **Improved code readability**: Enumerations make it clear what values a variable can take, making the code easier to understand.\n*   **Reduced errors**: By using named values, we can avoid mistakes that can occur when using magic numbers or strings.\n*   **Easier maintenance**: Enumerations make it easier to add or remove values, as we don't have to search for all occurrences of a specific value in the code.\n\n**Example Use Case: Status Codes**\n---------------------------------\n\nHere's an example of using an enumeration to represent status codes in a web application:\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass StatusCode(Enum):\n    SUCCESS = 200\n    NOT_FOUND = 404\n    INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR = 500\n\ndef handle_request(status_code):\n    if status_code == StatusCode.SUCCESS:\n        print(\"Request successful\")\n    elif status_code == StatusCode.NOT_FOUND:\n        print(\"Resource not found\")\n    elif status_code == StatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR:\n        print(\"Internal server error\")\n\n# Using the function\nhandle_request(StatusCode.SUCCESS)  # Output: Request successful\nhandle_request(StatusCode.NOT_FOUND)  # Output: Resource not found\n```\nIn this example, we define an enumeration `StatusCode` with three named values, each representing a common HTTP status code. We can then use these named values in our `handle_request` function to determine how to handle different status codes.",
