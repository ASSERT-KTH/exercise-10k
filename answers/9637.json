  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that transforms another function with multiple arguments into a sequence of single-argument functions, a technique known as currying. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef curry(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses currying to transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The original function with multiple arguments.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A curried version of the original function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a nested function that will be returned by the curry function\n    def curried(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # If the number of arguments passed is equal to the number of arguments required by the original function,\n        # then we can call the original function and return its result\n        if len(args) + len(kwargs) == func.__code__.co_argcount:\n            return func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # If the number of arguments passed is less than the number of arguments required by the original function,\n        # then we need to return another function that takes the remaining arguments\n        else:\n            # Define another nested function that takes the remaining arguments\n            def next_curried(*next_args, **next_kwargs):\n                return curried(*(args + next_args), **dict(kwargs, **next_kwargs))\n            \n            # Return the next_curried function\n            return next_curried\n    \n    # Return the curried function\n    return curried\n\n# Example usage:\ndef add(a, b, c):\n    return a + b + c\n\ncurried_add = curry(add)\nprint(curried_add(1)(2)(3))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `curry` function takes another function `func` as its argument and returns a new function `curried` that applies currying to `func`.\n* Within `curried`, it checks if the number of arguments passed matches the number of arguments `func` requires. If they match, it calls `func` with the provided arguments and returns the result.\n* If the number of arguments passed is less than required, `curried` returns another function `next_curried` that takes additional arguments and recursively calls `curried` with the combined arguments.\n* This process allows the curried function to be called with one argument at a time, until all required arguments are provided, at which point the original function is called with all the arguments.",
