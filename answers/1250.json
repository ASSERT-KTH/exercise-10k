  "answer": "### Closure Function Example\n#### Overview\nA closure is a function that returns another function. The returned function has access to the variables of the outer function.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef outer_function(greeting):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a closure function that takes a name as an argument.\n\n    Args:\n        greeting (str): The greeting to use in the returned function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def inner_function(name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints a greeting message.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name to include in the greeting.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"{greeting}, {name}!\")\n\n    return inner_function\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a closure function with a greeting\n    hello = outer_function(\"Hello\")\n    hi = outer_function(\"Hi\")\n\n    # Use the closure functions\n    hello(\"Alice\")\n    hi(\"Bob\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `outer_function` takes a `greeting` as an argument.\n2. It defines and returns an `inner_function` that takes a `name` as an argument.\n3. The `inner_function` has access to the `greeting` variable from the `outer_function`.\n4. When called, the `inner_function` prints a greeting message using the `greeting` and `name`.\n\n#### Output\n```\nHello, Alice!\nHi, Bob!\n```",
