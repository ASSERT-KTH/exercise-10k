  "prompt": "Create a function called 'calculate_stats' that takes a list of exam scores as input and returns a dictionary containing the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score. The function should also handle cases where the input list is empty.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates and returns statistics for a list of exam scores, handling cases where the input list is empty. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_stats(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and returns the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score from a given list of exam scores.\n    \n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of exam scores.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score. If the input list is empty, it returns None for all values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input list is empty\n    if not scores:\n        # If the list is empty, we return a dictionary with None values for all stats\n        return {\n            'average': None,\n            'highest': None,\n            'lowest': None\n        }\n\n    # Next, we calculate the average score by summing up all scores and dividing by the number of scores\n    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n    # Then, we find the highest score by using the built-in max function\n    highest_score = max(scores)\n\n    # After that, we find the lowest score by using the built-in min function\n    lowest_score = min(scores)\n\n    # Finally, we return a dictionary containing the calculated stats\n    return {\n        'average': average_score,\n        'highest': highest_score,\n        'lowest': lowest_score\n    }\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_stats` first checks if the input list `scores` is empty. If it is, the function returns a dictionary with `None` values for 'average', 'highest', and 'lowest' scores.\n* It then calculates the average score by summing up all scores using `sum(scores)` and dividing by the number of scores `len(scores)`, storing the result in `average_score`.\n* The function uses built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the highest and lowest scores in the list, storing them in `highest_score` and `lowest_score` respectively.\n* Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the calculated 'average', 'highest', and 'lowest' scores.",
