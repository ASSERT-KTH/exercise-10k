  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python function that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef word_scramble_game():\n    # List of words to scramble\n    words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word_to_scramble = random.choice(words)\n\n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = \"\".join(random.sample(word_to_scramble, len(word_to_scramble)))\n\n    # Ask the user to unscramble the word\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    user_answer = input(\"Your answer: \")\n\n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    if user_answer.lower() == word_to_scramble:\n        print(\"Congratulations! You unscrambled the word correctly.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {word_to_scramble}.\")\n\n# Run the game\nword_scramble_game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n------------------------\n\n1. The function `word_scramble_game` chooses a random word from a list of words.\n2. It scrambles the word by randomly rearranging its letters.\n3. The scrambled word is then printed to the console, and the user is prompted to enter their answer.\n4. The user's answer is compared to the original word, and feedback is provided based on whether the answer is correct or not.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n---------------------\n\nTo run the game, simply call the `word_scramble_game` function. The game will choose a random word, scramble it, and ask the user to unscramble it.\n\nNote: This code uses a simple list of words, but you can easily modify it to use a larger dictionary or word list. You can also add additional features, such as keeping track of the user's score or providing hints for difficult words.",
