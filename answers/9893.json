  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        if not guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Convert the input to an integer\n        guess = int(guess)\n\n        # Increment the attempt counter\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `random.randint(1, 10)` function generates a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive).\n2. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. The input is checked to ensure it's a valid integer. If not, the user is asked to try again.\n4. The guess is compared to the number to guess. If it's too low or too high, the user is given a hint.\n5. Once the user correctly guesses the number, the program congratulates them and tells them how many attempts it took.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `guessing_game.py`) and execute it with Python (e.g., `python guessing_game.py`). Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.",
