  "answer": "**Rectangle Area Function**\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be positive numbers.\")\n\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `calculate_rectangle_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be floating-point numbers.\n*   It checks if either the length or width is less than or equal to zero and raises a `ValueError` if so, as the area of a rectangle cannot be calculated with non-positive dimensions.\n*   The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width together.\n*   The `main` function provides an example usage of the `calculate_rectangle_area` function, calculating the area of a rectangle with a length of 5.0 and a width of 3.0, and printing the result.",
