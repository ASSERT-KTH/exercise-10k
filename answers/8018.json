  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score in an exam. The program should have a function to calculate the grade and another function to display the grade. The grade is calculated as follows: score < 40 is F, 40-59 is D, 60-69 is C, 70-79 is B, and 80 or above is A.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score < 40:\n        return 'F'\n    elif score < 60:\n        return 'D'\n    elif score < 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score < 80:\n        return 'B'\n    else:\n        return 'A'\n\n\ndef display_grade(score, grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Display the grade of a student.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n        grade (str): The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    score = int(input(\"Enter the score of the student: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    display_grade(score, grade)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes an integer `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade as a string.\n*   The `display_grade` function takes an integer `score` and a string `grade` as input and prints them to the console.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the score of the student. The `calculate_grade` function is then called to calculate the grade, and the `display_grade` function is called to display the score and grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters a score of 30, the program will output:\n\n    ```\nScore: 30\nGrade: F\n```\n*   If the user enters a score of 75, the program will output:\n\n    ```\nScore: 75\nGrade: B\n```\n*   If the user enters a score of 90, the program will output:\n\n    ```\nScore: 90\nGrade: A\n```",
