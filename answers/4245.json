  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I was thinking of number {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        # Check if the user's guess is too high\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Lower\")\n        # Check if the user's guess is too low\n        else:\n            print(\"Higher\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program enters a loop where it continuously asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.\n4. If the user's guess is not correct, the program checks if it is too high or too low and prints \"Higher\" or \"Lower\" accordingly.\n5. The program continues to ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or type \"quit\" to quit the game.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the script. The program will guide the user through the game, asking for their guess and providing feedback until they correctly guess the number or quit the game.\n\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nLower\nTake a guess: 25\nHigher\nTake a guess: 37\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
