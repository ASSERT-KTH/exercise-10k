  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nThis program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define the questions and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Rome\"],\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": [\"Earth\", \"Saturn\", \"Jupiter\", \"Uranus\"],\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": [\"Ag\", \"Au\", \"Hg\", \"Pb\"],\n    \"What is the largest mammal?\": [\"Blue whale\", \"African elephant\", \"Hippopotamus\", \"Giraffe\"],\n    \"What is the smallest country in the world?\": [\"Vatican City\", \"Monaco\", \"Nauru\", \"Tuvalu\"]\n}\n\nanswers = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\",\n    \"What is the largest mammal?\": \"Blue whale\",\n    \"What is the smallest country in the world?\": \"Vatican City\"\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Ask each question\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion: {question}\")\n        for i, option in enumerate(options):\n            print(f\"{i+1}. {option}\")\n\n        # Get the user's answer\n        user_answer = input(\"Enter the number of your answer: \")\n\n        # Check if the user's answer is correct\n        if options[int(user_answer) - 1] == answers[question]:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {answers[question]}.\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz complete! Your final score is {score}/{len(questions)}.\")\n\n# Run the quiz\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `questions` where each key is a question and each value is a list of possible answers.\n2. The program defines a dictionary `answers` where each key is a question and each value is the correct answer.\n3. The `quiz` function initializes the score to 0 and then asks each question in the `questions` dictionary.\n4. For each question, the program prints the question and the possible answers, and then asks the user to enter the number of their answer.\n5. The program checks if the user's answer is correct by comparing it to the correct answer in the `answers` dictionary. If the answer is correct, the program increments the score and prints a success message. If the answer is incorrect, the program prints an error message with the correct answer.\n6. After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you a series of questions and keep track of your score. For example:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\n1. Paris\n2. London\n3. Berlin\n4. Rome\nEnter the number of your answer: 1\nCorrect!\n\nQuestion: What is the largest planet in our solar system?\n1. Earth\n2. Saturn\n3. Jupiter\n4. Uranus\nEnter the number of your answer: 3\nCorrect!\n\n...\n\nQuiz complete! Your final score is 5/5.\n```",
