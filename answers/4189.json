  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates a weather forecast based on the current temperature and humidity. It uses a simple classification system to determine the forecast.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_weather_forecast(temperature: float, humidity: float) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a weather forecast based on the current temperature and humidity.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n        humidity (float): The current humidity as a percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string describing the weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the temperature ranges for each forecast type\n    if temperature < 0:\n        temperature_forecast = \"Freezing\"\n    elif temperature < 15:\n        temperature_forecast = \"Cold\"\n    elif temperature < 25:\n        temperature_forecast = \"Mild\"\n    elif temperature < 30:\n        temperature_forecast = \"Warm\"\n    else:\n        temperature_forecast = \"Hot\"\n\n    # Define the humidity ranges for each forecast type\n    if humidity < 30:\n        humidity_forecast = \"Dry\"\n    elif humidity < 60:\n        humidity_forecast = \"Moderate\"\n    elif humidity < 80:\n        humidity_forecast = \"Humid\"\n    else:\n        humidity_forecast = \"Very Humid\"\n\n    # Combine the temperature and humidity forecasts\n    forecast = f\"The weather will be {temperature_forecast} and {humidity_forecast}.\"\n\n    return forecast\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    temperature = 22\n    humidity = 50\n    print(generate_weather_forecast(temperature, humidity))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `temperature` and `humidity`.\n2. It uses if-elif-else statements to classify the temperature and humidity into different ranges.\n3. The temperature ranges are:\n\t* Freezing: < 0\u00b0C\n\t* Cold: 0-15\u00b0C\n\t* Mild: 15-25\u00b0C\n\t* Warm: 25-30\u00b0C\n\t* Hot: > 30\u00b0C\n4. The humidity ranges are:\n\t* Dry: < 30%\n\t* Moderate: 30-60%\n\t* Humid: 60-80%\n\t* Very Humid: > 80%\n5. The function combines the temperature and humidity forecasts into a single string.\n6. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with sample temperature and humidity values.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This is a simplified weather forecasting system and does not take into account other factors that can affect the weather, such as wind, atmospheric pressure, and more.\n* The temperature and humidity ranges can be adjusted to suit specific needs or regions.",
