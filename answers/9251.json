  "answer": "**Nested Conditional Statements Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of nested conditional statements to make decisions based on multiple conditions. The program will determine the eligibility of a student to join a university based on their age, GPA, and test scores.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef check_eligibility(age, gpa, test_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student is eligible to join a university based on their age, GPA, and test scores.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The student's age.\n        gpa (float): The student's GPA.\n        test_score (int): The student's test score.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the student is eligible, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age >= 17:  # Check if the student is at least 17 years old\n        if gpa >= 3.0:  # Check if the student's GPA is at least 3.0\n            if test_score >= 80:  # Check if the student's test score is at least 80\n                return True  # The student is eligible\n            else:\n                print(\"Test score is too low. Eligibility denied.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"GPA is too low. Eligibility denied.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Age is too low. Eligibility denied.\")\n    return False  # The student is not eligible\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    age = 20\n    gpa = 3.5\n    test_score = 90\n    if check_eligibility(age, gpa, test_score):\n        print(\"Congratulations, you are eligible to join the university!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you are not eligible to join the university.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `check_eligibility` function takes three arguments: `age`, `gpa`, and `test_score`.\n2. The function uses nested conditional statements to check the eligibility criteria:\n\t* Age: at least 17 years old\n\t* GPA: at least 3.0\n\t* Test score: at least 80\n3. If all conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the student is eligible.\n4. If any condition is not met, the function prints an error message and returns `False`.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `check_eligibility` function with example values.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* A 20-year-old student with a GPA of 3.5 and a test score of 90 is eligible to join the university.\n* A 16-year-old student with a GPA of 3.5 and a test score of 90 is not eligible due to age.\n* A 20-year-old student with a GPA of 2.5 and a test score of 90 is not eligible due to GPA.\n* A 20-year-old student with a GPA of 3.5 and a test score of 70 is not eligible due to test score.",
