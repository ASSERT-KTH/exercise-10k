  "answer": "**Text Analyzer Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program analyzes a piece of text and prints out statistics about the text, such as the number of words and characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a piece of text and returns statistics about the text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The text to analyze.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing statistics about the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    text = text.strip()\n\n    # Calculate the number of characters\n    num_chars = len(text)\n\n    # Calculate the number of words\n    words = text.split()\n    num_words = len(words)\n\n    # Calculate the number of sentences\n    num_sentences = text.count('.') + text.count('!') + text.count('?')\n\n    # Calculate the average word length\n    avg_word_len = sum(len(word) for word in words) / num_words if num_words > 0 else 0\n\n    # Return the statistics\n    return {\n        'num_chars': num_chars,\n        'num_words': num_words,\n        'num_sentences': num_sentences,\n        'avg_word_len': avg_word_len\n    }\n\ndef print_statistics(stats):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out statistics about the text.\n\n    Args:\n        stats (dict): A dictionary containing statistics about the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Text Statistics:\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    print(f\"Number of Characters: {stats['num_chars']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Words: {stats['num_words']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Sentences: {stats['num_sentences']}\")\n    print(f\"Average Word Length: {stats['avg_word_len']:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the text from the user\n    text = input(\"Enter a piece of text: \")\n\n    # Analyze the text\n    stats = analyze_text(text)\n\n    # Print the statistics\n    print_statistics(stats)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a piece of text when prompted.\n3. The program will print out statistics about the text, including the number of characters, words, sentences, and average word length.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that sentences end with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.\n* The average word length is calculated by summing the lengths of all words and dividing by the total number of words. If there are no words, the average word length is 0.",
