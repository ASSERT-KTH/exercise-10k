  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns True if the first is less than or equal to the second, False otherwise",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that compares two numbers and returns True if the first number is less than or equal to the second, and False otherwise. This function will help you simplify comparisons in your code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compare_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function compares two numbers and returns True if the first number is less than or equal to the second number.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number for comparison.\n        num2 (int): The second number for comparison.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if num1 is less than or equal to num2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if both inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be numbers\")\n\n    # Now, we can simply compare the two numbers using the <= operator.\n    # This operator returns True if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.\n    return num1 <= num2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `compare_numbers` takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, which are the numbers to be compared. It first checks if both inputs are numbers, raising a TypeError if not.\n* The comparison is performed using the `<=` operator, which returns True if `num1` is less than or equal to `num2`, and False otherwise.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its purpose, explains the arguments it takes, and describes its return value.\n* Error handling is implemented through an `if` statement that checks the type of the inputs using `isinstance`, ensuring that both `num1` and `num2` are either integers or floats.",
