  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates in a 2D or 3D space.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): Coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (list): Coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    squared_diffs = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n    return math.sqrt(sum(squared_diffs))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = [1, 2, 3]  # coordinates of the first point\n    point2 = [4, 5, 6]  # coordinates of the second point\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two points as input, each represented as a list of coordinates.\n2. It checks if both points have the same number of dimensions. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points using a list comprehension.\n4. It returns the square root of the sum of these squared differences, which represents the distance between the two points.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with two example points.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculating the distance between two cities on a map given their latitude and longitude coordinates.\n* Determining the distance between two objects in a 3D space, such as in computer graphics or physics simulations.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Make sure to handle cases where the input points have different numbers of dimensions.\n* Consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as the `numpy` library, for large-scale calculations.\n* Use this program as a starting point and modify it to suit your specific use case.",
