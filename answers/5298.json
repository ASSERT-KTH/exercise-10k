  "prompt": "Write a program that implements the selection sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. Use a for loop to iterate over the list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that implements the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(numbers):\n    # Loop through the list\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        # Assume the first element is the smallest\n        min_index = i\n        \n        # Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list\n        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):\n            if numbers[j] < numbers[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        \n        # Swap the smallest element with the first element of the unsorted part\n        numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i]\n    \n    return numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", selection_sort(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `selection_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and sorts it in ascending order.\n*   The outer loop (`for i in range(len(numbers))`) iterates over each element in the list.\n*   The inner loop (`for j in range(i+1, len(numbers))`) finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list.\n*   Once the smallest element is found, it is swapped with the first element of the unsorted part (`numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i]`).\n*   The function returns the sorted list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm uses two nested loops to compare and swap elements.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional space to store the temporary swap variable. The input list is sorted in-place, without requiring any additional space that scales with the input size.",
