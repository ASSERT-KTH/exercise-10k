  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns True if the first array is a subset of the second array, and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubset(self, A, B):\n        if len(A) == 0:\n            return True\n\n        for i in A:\n            if i not in B:\n                return False\n\n        return True\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isSubset` that takes two arrays `A` and `B` as input. It checks if all elements of `A` are present in `B` and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We first check if the length of `A` is 0. If it is, we return `True` because an empty set is a subset of any set.\n2. We then iterate over each element `i` in `A`.\n3. For each element `i`, we check if it is not present in `B` using the `not in` operator. If it is not present, we immediately return `False`.\n4. If we have iterated over all elements of `A` and haven't returned `False`, it means that all elements of `A` are present in `B`. In this case, we return `True`.\n\nYou can test this code with the examples you provided:\n```\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.isSubset([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # True\nprint(solution.isSubset([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4, 5]))  # False\n```",
