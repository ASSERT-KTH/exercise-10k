  "prompt": "Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a given string.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    return string.count(char)\n\nstring = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nchar = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n\nprint(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `count_char` that takes a string and a character as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified character.\n\nThe program then asks the user to enter a string and a character, and prints out the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\nYou can also use a loop to count the characters, here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    count = 0\n    for c in string:\n        if c == char:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nstring = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nchar = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n\nprint(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count_char(string, char)} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nThis program uses a loop to iterate over each character in the string. If the character matches the specified character, it increments a counter. At the end of the loop, it returns the counter, which represents the number of occurrences of the character in the string.",
