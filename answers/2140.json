  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a reduction function as input and returns a single value, which is the result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a reduction operation to all elements in a given list, resulting in a single output value. This function will take a list and a reduction function as input and return the result after applying the reduction function to all elements. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef reduce_list(input_list, reduction_function):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a reduction function to all elements in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list of elements to apply the reduction function to.\n        reduction_function (function): A function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not input_list:\n        # If the list is empty, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message\n        raise TypeError(\"reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value\")\n\n    # Initialize the result variable with the first element of the list\n    # This will be used as the initial value for our reduction operation\n    result = input_list[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the rest of the list (from the second element to the end)\n    for element in input_list[1:]:\n        # Apply the reduction function to the current result and the current element\n        # Update the result with the outcome of this operation\n        result = reduction_function(result, element)\n\n    # After iterating over the entire list, return the final result\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a simple reduction function that adds two numbers\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Apply the reduction function to the list\nresult = reduce_list(numbers, add)\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `reduce_list` starts by checking if the `input_list` is empty. If it is, a `TypeError` is raised because there are no elements to apply the reduction function to.\n* It then initializes the `result` variable with the first element of the `input_list`. This serves as the starting point for the reduction operation.\n* The function iterates over the rest of the `input_list` (from the second element to the end), applying the `reduction_function` to the current `result` and each subsequent element, updating `result` with the outcome.\n* Finally, after processing all elements, the function returns the final `result`, which is the outcome of applying the `reduction_function` to all elements in the `input_list`.",
