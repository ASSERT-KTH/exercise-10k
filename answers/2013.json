  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's height and weight as input and returns their BMI using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n/**\n * @file BMI.java\n * @brief Calculates BMI based on height and weight, and determines the corresponding weight category.\n * @author [Your Name]\n * @date [Current Date]\n */\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BMI {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your height in meters: \");\n        double height = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your weight in kilograms: \");\n        double weight = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        double bmi = weight / (height * height);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Your BMI is: \" + bmi);\n\n        if (bmi < 18.5) {\n            System.out.println(\"You are underweight.\");\n        } else if (bmi >= 18.5 && bmi < 25) {\n            System.out.println(\"You are normal weight.\");\n        } else if (bmi >= 25 && bmi < 30) {\n            System.out.println(\"You are overweight.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"You are obese.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that I've left the author name and date blank, as these will vary depending on who is writing the code and when. You can fill these in as needed.",
