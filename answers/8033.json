  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses an if/else statement to determine a student's grade based on their score. The grade is calculated as follows:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the student's grade based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The if/else statement checks the score against the grade ranges and returns the corresponding grade.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function by prompting the user for a score and printing the calculated grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B\n* Enter a score of 92 to get a grade of A\n* Enter a score of 58 to get a grade of F\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input score is a valid number between 0 and 100. You may want to add additional error handling to handle invalid input.",
