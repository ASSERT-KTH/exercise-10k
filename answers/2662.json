  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and two integers as input, and returns the substring starting at the first integer and ending at the second integer.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef substring(s, i, f):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the substring of s starting at index i and ending at index f.\n    \"\"\"\n    return s[i:f+1]\n\n# Example usage:\ns = \"hello\"\ni = 1\nf = 3\nprint(substring(s, i, f))  # Output: \"ell\"\n```\nThis code defines the `substring` function with the specified parameters and return value. The function uses Python's slice notation to extract the desired substring from the input string `s`. The `+1` in the slice notation is used to include the character at index `f` in the substring.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input indices `i` and `f` are valid (i.e., `0 <= i <= f < len(s)`). If the indices are invalid, the function may raise an exception or return an incorrect result.",
