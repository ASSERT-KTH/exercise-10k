  "answer": "**Largest Square Submatrix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a binary matrix, find the size of the largest square submatrix.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where each cell stores the size of the largest square submatrix with the bottom right corner at that cell.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef largest_square_submatrix(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the size of the largest square submatrix in a given binary matrix.\n\n    Args:\n    matrix (list): A 2D list of binary values (0s and 1s).\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The size of the largest square submatrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return 0\n\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    max_size = 0\n\n    # Initialize the first row and column\n    for i in range(rows):\n        dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0]\n        max_size = max(max_size, dp[i][0])\n    for j in range(cols):\n        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j]\n        max_size = max(max_size, dp[0][j])\n\n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            if matrix[i][j] == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1\n                max_size = max(max_size, dp[i][j])\n\n    return max_size\n\n# Example usage\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n]\nprint(\"Size of the largest square submatrix:\", largest_square_submatrix(matrix))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We create a dp table with the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n*   We initialize the first row and column of the dp table by copying the corresponding values from the input matrix.\n*   We fill the rest of the dp table using the following rule: if the current cell in the input matrix is 1, the size of the largest square submatrix with the bottom right corner at that cell is the minimum size of the largest square submatrices with the bottom right corners at the top, left, and top-left cells, plus 1.\n*   We keep track of the maximum size of the largest square submatrix found so far.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(rows \\* cols), where rows and cols are the dimensions of the input matrix.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(rows \\* cols), where rows and cols are the dimensions of the input matrix. We need to store the dp table, which has the same dimensions as the input matrix.",
