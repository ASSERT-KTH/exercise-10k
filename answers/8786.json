  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"The greatest common divisor of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", gcd(num1, num2))\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **User Input**: The program asks the user to input two numbers.\n2. **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and `a % b` until `b` is 0. At this point, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.\n3. **Result Output**: The program prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `12` and `15`, Output: `3`\n* Input: `24` and `30`, Output: `6`\n* Input: `7` and `11`, Output: `1`\n\n### Notes\n\n* The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n* This program uses a simple while loop to implement the Euclidean algorithm.\n* The program assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you will need to modify the program accordingly.",
