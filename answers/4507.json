  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a bank account management program in Python:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the deposit amount is negative.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative\")\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the current balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n        print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Displays the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n                account.deposit(amount)\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            try:\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Program Explanation\n\n*   The program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n*   The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` instance with an initial balance and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with their account.\n*   The program handles invalid user inputs and provides informative error messages.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to deposit $500.\n3.  Choose option 2 to withdraw $200.\n4.  Choose option 3 to check the current balance.\n5.  Choose option 4 to exit the program.\n\nThis program demonstrates basic bank account management functionality and can be extended to include additional features, such as multiple account types, transaction history, or user authentication.",
