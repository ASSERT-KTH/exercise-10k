  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given integers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code (Python)\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers, `num1` and `num2`, as input and returns their LCM.\n2. The GCD of `num1` and `num2` is calculated using the `math.gcd` function.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n4. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated by calculating the LCM of 12 and 15.\n\n### Running the Program\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `lcm_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python lcm_calculator.py`). The output will display the LCM of the two example numbers.",
