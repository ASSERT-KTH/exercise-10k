  "answer": "**Minimum Window Substring Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using a sliding window approach with the help of two pointers. The idea is to maintain a window of characters in `s` that contains all characters of `t`. We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end of the window.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`.\n    \n    Args:\n    s (str): The string to search for the minimum window.\n    t (str): The string containing the characters to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. If no such window exists, returns an empty string.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Base case: If `t` is longer than `s`, return an empty string\n    if len(t) > len(s):\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Create a counter for the characters in `t`\n    t_count = Counter(t)\n    \n    # Initialize the required character count to the length of `t`\n    required = len(t_count)\n    \n    # Initialize the left and right pointers\n    left = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the minimum window substring and its length\n    min_window = \"\"\n    min_window_len = float('inf')\n    \n    # Initialize the formed character count to 0\n    formed = 0\n    \n    # Create a counter for the characters in the window\n    window_counts = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the string `s` with the right pointer\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        # Add the character at the right pointer to the window counts\n        character = s[right]\n        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1\n        \n        # If the character is in `t` and its count in the window is equal to its count in `t`, increment the formed count\n        if character in t_count and window_counts[character] == t_count[character]:\n            formed += 1\n        \n        # While the window contains all characters of `t` and the left pointer is less than the right pointer\n        while left <= right and formed == required:\n            # Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller\n            if right - left + 1 < min_window_len:\n                min_window = s[left:right + 1]\n                min_window_len = right - left + 1\n            \n            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window counts\n            character = s[left]\n            window_counts[character] -= 1\n            \n            # If the character is in `t` and its count in the window is less than its count in `t`, decrement the formed count\n            if character in t_count and window_counts[character] < t_count[character]:\n                formed -= 1\n            \n            # Move the left pointer to the right\n            left += 1\n    \n    # Return the minimum window substring\n    return min_window\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"ADOBECODEBANC\"\nt = \"ABC\"\nprint(min_window(s, t))  # Output: \"BANC\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We create a counter `t_count` to store the count of each character in `t`.\n2.  We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end of the window.\n3.  We create a counter `window_counts` to store the count of each character in the window.\n4.  We iterate over the string `s` with the `right` pointer, adding characters to the window and updating the `formed` count.\n5.  When the window contains all characters of `t`, we update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller.\n6.  We remove characters from the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right and update the `formed` count accordingly.\n7.  Finally, we return the minimum window substring.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(|s| + |t|), where |s| and |t| are the lengths of the strings `s` and `t`, respectively.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(|t|), where |t| is the length of the string `t`.",
