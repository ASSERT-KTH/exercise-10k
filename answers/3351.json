  "answer": "**Bank Account Manager Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a for loop to manage a list of bank accounts and perform transactions such as deposit, withdraw, and check balance.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder, balance=0):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_holder = account_holder\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f} into account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f} from account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Account {self.account_number} balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a list of bank accounts\n    accounts = [\n        BankAccount(\"12345\", \"John Doe\", 1000),\n        BankAccount(\"67890\", \"Jane Smith\", 500),\n        BankAccount(\"11111\", \"Bob Johnson\", 2000)\n    ]\n\n    # Manage accounts using a for loop\n    for account in accounts:\n        print(f\"\\nAccount Number: {account.account_number}, Account Holder: {account.account_holder}\")\n        account.check_balance()\n\n        # Perform transactions\n        while True:\n            print(\"\\n1. Deposit\")\n            print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n            print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n            print(\"4. Next Account\")\n            choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n            if choice == \"1\":\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n                account.deposit(amount)\n            elif choice == \"2\":\n                amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n                account.withdraw(amount)\n            elif choice == \"3\":\n                account.check_balance()\n            elif choice == \"4\":\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Select an account by entering the corresponding number.\n3. Choose a transaction option:\n\t* Deposit: Enter the amount to deposit.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the amount to withdraw.\n\t* Check Balance: View the current balance.\n\t* Next Account: Move to the next account.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each account.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would likely use a more robust interface, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface.",
