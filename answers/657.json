The tournament consists of a series of matches, and the winner of the tournament is the first player to win a specified number of matches.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)\"\"\"\n    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of a match\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'Tie'\n    elif (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper'):\n        return 'User'\n    else:\n        return 'Computer'\n\ndef play_tournament(num_matches_to_win):\n    \"\"\"Plays a tournament of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_wins = 0\n    computer_wins = 0\n\n    while user_wins < num_matches_to_win and computer_wins < num_matches_to_win:\n        print(\"\\n1. Rock\")\n        print(\"2. Paper\")\n        print(\"3. Scissors\")\n        user_choice_index = input(\"Enter the number of your choice: \")\n        user_choice = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'][int(user_choice_index) - 1]\n\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nUser choice: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer choice: {computer_choice}\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'Tie':\n            print(f\"It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'User':\n            print(f\"User wins this round!\")\n            user_wins += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Computer wins this round!\")\n            computer_wins += 1\n\n        print(f\"Score - User: {user_wins}, Computer: {computer_wins}\")\n\n    if user_wins == num_matches_to_win:\n        print(\"\\nUser wins the tournament!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nComputer wins the tournament!\")\n\ndef main():\n    num_matches_to_win = int(input(\"Enter the number of matches to win the tournament: \"))\n    play_tournament(num_matches_to_win)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `main` function. The program will prompt the user to enter the number of matches to win the tournament, and then it will start the tournament. The user will be prompted to enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for each match, and the program will display the computer's choice and the winner of each match. The tournament will continue until either the user or the computer wins the specified number of matches.",
