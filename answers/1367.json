Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4): \")\n\n        if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                print(num1, \"+\", num2, \"=\", add(num1, num2))\n\n            elif choice == '2':\n                print(num1, \"-\", num2, \"=\", subtract(num1, num2))\n\n            elif choice == '3':\n                print(num1, \"*\", num2, \"=\", multiply(num1, num2))\n\n            elif choice == '4':\n                try:\n                    print(num1, \"/\", num2, \"=\", divide(num1, num2))\n                except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n                    print(str(e))\n\n            next_calculation = input(\"Let's do next calculation?

It presents the user with a menu of options and asks for their choice.\n- Based on the user's choice, the program asks for two numbers, performs the chosen operation, and displays the result.\n- The program continues to prompt the user for calculations until they choose to stop.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).\n3. Enter the two numbers you want to operate on.\n4. The program will display the result of the operation.\n5. You can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.",
