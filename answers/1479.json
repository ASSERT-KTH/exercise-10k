  "prompt": "Write a program that declares and initializes an enumeration variable, then prints its value.",
  "answer": "Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define an enumeration class\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Color(Enum):\n    RED = 1\n    GREEN = 2\n    BLUE = 3\n\n# Declare and initialize an enumeration variable\ncolor = Color.GREEN\n\n# Print the value of the enumeration variable\nprint(color.value)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We import the `Enum` class from the `enum` module, which allows us to define enumerations.\n2.  We define an enumeration class called `Color` with three enumeration constants: `RED`, `GREEN`, and `BLUE`. Each constant has a value associated with it (1, 2, and 3, respectively).\n3.  We declare a variable `color` and initialize it with the `GREEN` enumeration constant.\n4.  Finally, we print the value of the `color` variable using the `value` attribute, which outputs `2` (the value associated with `GREEN`).",
