  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints out all numbers from 1 to the given number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out all numbers from 1 to the given number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(i)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n\n    # Validate user input\n    if num <= 0:\n        print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n    else:\n        print_numbers(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `print_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n2. Inside the loop, it prints each number in the range.\n3. The `main` function gets user input and validates it to ensure it's a positive integer.\n4. If the input is valid, it calls the `print_numbers` function to print the numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a positive integer. For example, if you enter `5`, it will print:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
