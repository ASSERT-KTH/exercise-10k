  "answer": "**Accessing a Dictionary Value by Key**\n======================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that demonstrates how to access a value in a dictionary by its key.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary\nmy_dict = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n}\n\n# Function to access a dictionary value by key\ndef access_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Access a value in a dictionary by its key.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key (str): The key of the value to access.\n\n    Returns:\n        The value associated with the given key if it exists, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dictionary.get(key)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    key = \"name\"\n    value = access_dict_value(my_dict, key)\n    \n    if value is not None:\n        print(f\"The value for key '{key}' is: {value}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Key '{key}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   We define a dictionary `my_dict` with some example key-value pairs.\n*   The `access_dict_value` function takes a dictionary and a key as input and uses the `get` method to access the value associated with the given key.\n*   If the key exists in the dictionary, the `get` method returns its value; otherwise, it returns `None` by default.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `access_dict_value` function to access a value in the dictionary.\n\n**Alternative Approach**\n-----------------------\n\nYou can also access a dictionary value by its key using square brackets `[]`, like this: `my_dict[\"name\"]`. However, this approach raises a `KeyError` if the key does not exist in the dictionary. The `get` method is generally safer and more convenient for accessing dictionary values.",
