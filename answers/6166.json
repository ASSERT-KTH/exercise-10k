  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n\nHere's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Check for negative numbers\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It uses recursion to calculate the factorial. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.\n*   The function raises a `ValueError` if the input number is negative, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function by calculating the factorial of the number 5.",
