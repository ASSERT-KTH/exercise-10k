  "answer": "**Calculating the Surface Area of a Cube**\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula for the surface area of a cube is `6 * (side_length)^2`, where `side_length` is the length of one side of the cube.\n\n### Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be greater than zero.\")\n\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_surface_area` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the calculated surface area.\n2. The function first checks if the side length is greater than zero. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The surface area is calculated using the formula `6 * (side_length)^2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_surface_area` function. It prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube, calculates the surface area, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Enter the side length of the cube: `5`\n* The surface area of the cube is: `150.00`",
