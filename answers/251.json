  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef concat(a, b):\n    result = []\n    while len(a) > 0:\n        result += [a[0]]\n        a = a[1:]\n    while len(b) > 0:\n        result += [b[0]]\n        b = b[1:]\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(concat(a, b))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\nThis code defines a function `concat` that takes two arrays `a` and `b` as input, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays. The function uses two loops to iterate over the elements of the input arrays, and uses the `+=` operator to append each element to the `result` list. The function returns the `result` list when both loops have finished. The test case demonstrates the function's behavior with two example input arrays.",
