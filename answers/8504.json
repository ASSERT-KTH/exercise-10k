  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    reversed_s = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):\n        reversed_s += s[i]\n    return reversed_s\n\ndef main():\n    str = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    reversed_str = reverse_string(str)\n    print(\"Reversed string: \", reversed_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've followed the specification exactly, including the variable names and the way the `main` function is defined. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything!",
