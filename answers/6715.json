  "answer": "**File Input Processor Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program reads input from a file, processes it, and prints the results.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.x\n* Input file with text data (e.g., `input.txt`)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef process_file(input_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads input from a file, processes it, and prints the results.\n\n    Args:\n        input_file (str): Path to the input file\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n            # Read the file line by line\n            lines = file.readlines()\n\n            # Process each line (e.g., strip whitespace, convert to uppercase)\n            processed_lines = [line.strip().upper() for line in lines]\n\n            # Print the processed lines\n            for line in processed_lines:\n                print(line)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{input_file}' not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef main():\n    input_file = 'input.txt'  # Replace with your input file path\n    process_file(input_file)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `process_file` function takes an input file path as an argument.\n2. It attempts to open the file in read mode (`'r'`) using a `with` statement, which ensures the file is properly closed after reading.\n3. The file is read line by line using the `readlines()` method.\n4. Each line is processed using a list comprehension, which strips whitespace and converts the text to uppercase.\n5. The processed lines are printed to the console.\n6. The `main` function sets the input file path and calls the `process_file` function.\n7. Error handling is implemented to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nCreate a file named `input.txt` with the following content:\n```\nhello world\nthis is a test\npython programming\n```\nRun the program, and it will print the processed lines:\n```\nHELLO WORLD\nTHIS IS A TEST\nPYTHON PROGRAMMING\n```",
