  "answer": "### Filtering Students by Age\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that filters students in a dictionary based on their age.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with student information\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": {\"age\": 20, \"grade\": 3.5},\n    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 22, \"grade\": 3.8},\n    \"Bob\": {\"age\": 19, \"grade\": 3.2},\n    \"Emma\": {\"age\": 21, \"grade\": 3.6},\n    \"Michael\": {\"age\": 23, \"grade\": 3.9},\n}\n\n# Function to filter students by age\ndef filter_students_by_age(students, min_age=None, max_age=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter students in a dictionary based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n    - students (dict): Dictionary with student information.\n    - min_age (int, optional): Minimum age to filter by. Defaults to None.\n    - max_age (int, optional): Maximum age to filter by. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n    - dict: Dictionary with filtered student information.\n    \"\"\"\n    filtered_students = {}\n    for name, info in students.items():\n        if (min_age is None or info[\"age\"] >= min_age) and (max_age is None or info[\"age\"] <= max_age):\n            filtered_students[name] = info\n    return filtered_students\n\n# Example usage\nprint(\"All Students:\")\nfor name, info in students.items():\n    print(f\"{name}: {info}\")\n\n# Filter students by age\nmin_age = 20\nmax_age = 22\nfiltered_students = filter_students_by_age(students, min_age, max_age)\n\nprint(f\"\\nStudents between {min_age} and {max_age} years old:\")\nfor name, info in filtered_students.items():\n    print(f\"{name}: {info}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  Define a dictionary `students` with student names as keys and dictionaries containing their age and grade as values.\n2.  Create a function `filter_students_by_age` that takes the `students` dictionary and optional `min_age` and `max_age` parameters.\n3.  Inside the function, iterate through the `students` dictionary and check if each student's age falls within the specified range (if `min_age` and `max_age` are provided).\n4.  If the student's age meets the criteria, add them to the `filtered_students` dictionary.\n5.  Return the `filtered_students` dictionary.\n6.  In the example usage, print all students and then filter students between 20 and 22 years old using the `filter_students_by_age` function.",
