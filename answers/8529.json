  "answer": "**Triangle Perimeter Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): Length of side a\n        b (float): Length of side b\n        c (float): Length of side c\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Perimeter of the triangle\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the sides can form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"The sides cannot form a valid triangle\")\n\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = a + b + c\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    a = 3  # Length of side a\n    b = 4  # Length of side b\n    c = 5  # Length of side c\n\n    try:\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the triangle is: {perimeter}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_perimeter` function takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.\n2. The function first checks if the sides can form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. If this condition is not met, a `ValueError` is raised.\n3. If the sides can form a valid triangle, the function calculates the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_perimeter` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the perimeter of a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5.\n* Calculate the perimeter of a triangle with sides of length 10, 20, and 30.\n* Attempt to calculate the perimeter of a triangle with sides of length 1, 2, and 5 (this should raise a `ValueError` because the sides cannot form a valid triangle).",
