  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane given their coordinates. It uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding coordinates.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It calculates the differences between the corresponding coordinates using `x2 - x1` and `y2 - y1`.\n3. It squares these differences using `**2`.\n4. It sums these squared differences using `+`.\n5. It takes the square root of the sum using `math.sqrt`.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_distance` with example points.\n7. The distance is printed to the console with two decimal places using `:.2f`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two cities on a map given their latitude and longitude coordinates.\n* Determine the distance between two objects in a game or simulation.\n* Measure the distance between two points in a graphical user interface (GUI).",
