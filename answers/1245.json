  "answer": "**Higher-Order Function: Apply Function to List of Numbers**\n\n### Overview\nThe following code defines a higher-order function `apply_to_list` that takes a function and a list of numbers as arguments. It applies the provided function to each number in the list and returns the resulting list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef apply_to_list(func, numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to apply to the list of numbers.\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to apply the function to.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of results after applying the function to each number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [func(num) for num in numbers]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef square(x):\n    \"\"\"Returns the square of a number.\"\"\"\n    return x ** 2\n\ndef double(x):\n    \"\"\"Returns the double of a number.\"\"\"\n    return x * 2\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nsquared_numbers = apply_to_list(square, numbers)\nprint(\"Squared numbers:\", squared_numbers)\n\ndoubled_numbers = apply_to_list(double, numbers)\nprint(\"Doubled numbers:\", doubled_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `apply_to_list` function takes two arguments: `func` (the function to apply) and `numbers` (the list of numbers).\n*   It uses a list comprehension to apply the provided function `func` to each number `num` in the `numbers` list.\n*   The results are collected in a new list, which is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we define two simple functions: `square` and `double`.\n*   We then create a list of numbers and apply these functions to the list using the `apply_to_list` function.\n*   The resulting lists of squared and doubled numbers are printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSquared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nDoubled numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```",
