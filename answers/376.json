  "prompt": "Create a function called 'calculate_grade' that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns their corresponding grade. The grade scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that determines a student's grade based on their score, handling both valid and invalid score ranges. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the score is within the valid range of 0 to 100\n    if not 0 <= score <= 100:\n        # If the score is not within the valid range, we return an error message\n        return \"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\"\n\n    # If the score is 90 or above, the student gets an A\n    if score >= 90:\n        # We return the grade 'A'\n        return 'A'\n\n    # If the score is 80 or above but less than 90, the student gets a B\n    elif score >= 80:\n        # We return the grade 'B'\n        return 'B'\n\n    # If the score is 70 or above but less than 80, the student gets a C\n    elif score >= 70:\n        # We return the grade 'C'\n        return 'C'\n\n    # If the score is 60 or above but less than 70, the student gets a D\n    elif score >= 60:\n        # We return the grade 'D'\n        return 'D'\n\n    # If the score is less than 60, the student gets an F\n    else:\n        # We return the grade 'F'\n        return 'F'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_grade` function first checks if the input `score` is within the valid range of 0 to 100. If not, it returns an error message.\n* The function then uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine the grade based on the `score`. For example, if the `score` is 90 or above, it returns 'A'.\n* Each `elif` statement checks for a specific grade range, ensuring that the function returns the correct grade for the given `score`.\n* If the `score` is less than 60, the function returns 'F' as the grade.",
