  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a function as input, and returns the result of applying the function to all elements in the list.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a given function to all elements in a list and returns the results. This will help you understand how to process list elements using a custom function. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef apply_function(lst, func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to all elements in a list and returns the results.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        func (function): The function to be applied to each element in the list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the results of applying the function to each element in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of applying the function to each element\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Apply the function to the current element and append the result to the result list\n        result.append(func(element))\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nprint(apply_function(numbers, square))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes two parameters: `lst` (the input list) and `func` (the function to be applied). It initializes an empty list `result` to store the outcomes of applying `func` to each element in `lst`.\n* The function iterates over each `element` in `lst` using a for loop. For each `element`, it applies `func` and appends the result to the `result` list.\n* After processing all elements, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the results of applying `func` to each element in the input list.\n* In the example usage, a list of numbers and a function `square` (which calculates the square of a number) are provided. The `apply_function` is then called with these inputs, and it returns a new list containing the squares of the original numbers.",
