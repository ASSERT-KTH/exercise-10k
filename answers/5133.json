  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given integer is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given integer is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `False`, as prime numbers are greater than 1.\n3. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`). If so, it returns `False`, as `n` is not prime.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `is_prime` function by prompting the user to enter a number and then checking if it's prime.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a trial division method, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized integers. For larger integers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.\n* The `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` expression is used to optimize the loop by only checking up to the square root of `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` would have already been checked as a smaller factor.",
