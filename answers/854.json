  "answer": "### Tail Recursive Factorial Function\n#### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given integer using tail recursion. Tail recursion is a form of recursion where the last operation performed by the function is the recursive call.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n, accumulator=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using tail recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n    accumulator (int): The accumulator for the factorial calculation. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return the accumulator\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return accumulator\n    # Recursive case: call the function with n-1 and the accumulator multiplied by n\n    else:\n        return factorial(n-1, accumulator * n)\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes two parameters: `n` (the number to calculate the factorial of) and `accumulator` (the accumulator for the factorial calculation).\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns the `accumulator`.\n*   In the recursive case, the function calls itself with `n-1` and the `accumulator` multiplied by `n`.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `factorial` function by calculating the factorial of 5.\n\nNote that while this function uses tail recursion, Python does not optimize for tail recursion, so it may still cause a stack overflow for large values of `n`.",
