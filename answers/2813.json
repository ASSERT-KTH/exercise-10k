  "answer": "### Color Mixing Program\n#### Description\nThis program asks the user for two colors and prints out the resulting color when they are mixed. It uses a dictionary to map color combinations to their resulting colors.\n\n#### Code\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to map color combinations to their resulting colors\ncolor_mixing = {\n    (\"red\", \"blue\"): \"purple\",\n    (\"blue\", \"red\"): \"purple\",\n    (\"red\", \"yellow\"): \"orange\",\n    (\"yellow\", \"red\"): \"orange\",\n    (\"blue\", \"yellow\"): \"green\",\n    (\"yellow\", \"blue\"): \"green\",\n}\n\ndef get_color(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Get a color from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        color = input(prompt).lower()\n        if color in [\"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\"]:\n            return color\n        print(\"Invalid color. Please enter 'red', 'blue', or 'yellow'.\")\n\ndef mix_colors(color1, color2):\n    \"\"\"Mix two colors and return the resulting color.\"\"\"\n    return color_mixing.get((color1, color2), \"unknown\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get two colors from the user\n    color1 = get_color(\"Enter the first color (red, blue, or yellow): \")\n    color2 = get_color(\"Enter the second color (red, blue, or yellow): \")\n\n    # Mix the colors and print the resulting color\n    resulting_color = mix_colors(color1, color2)\n    print(f\"When you mix {color1} and {color2}, you get {resulting_color}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n* Run the program and enter \"red\" and \"blue\" to get \"purple\".\n* Run the program and enter \"yellow\" and \"blue\" to get \"green\".\n* Run the program and enter \"red\" and \"yellow\" to get \"orange\".\n\n#### Notes\n* This program only supports mixing of primary colors (red, blue, and yellow).\n* The program uses a dictionary to map color combinations to their resulting colors. This makes it easy to add or modify color combinations in the future.\n* The `get_color` function ensures that the user enters a valid color.\n* The `mix_colors` function returns the resulting color when two colors are mixed. If the color combination is not found in the dictionary, it returns \"unknown\".",
