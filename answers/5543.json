  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10 using nested for loops.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specifications, here is the code:\n\n```python\nfor x in range(1, 11):\n    for y in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{x} * {y} = {x * y}\")\n    print()  # empty print statement to print a newline\n```\n\nThis code will print the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns. The `print()` statement inside the inner loop prints the multiplication operation and its result for each cell in the table. The empty `print()` statement after the inner loop prints a newline to separate each row of the table.",
