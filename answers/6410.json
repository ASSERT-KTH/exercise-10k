  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a day of the week as input and prints out the corresponding day of the week. Use if/else statements to determine the day.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_day_of_week(day):\n    \"\"\"Prints the corresponding day of the week based on the input.\"\"\"\n    if day == \"monday\":\n        print(\"Monday\")\n    elif day == \"tuesday\":\n        print(\"Tuesday\")\n    elif day == \"wednesday\":\n        print(\"Wednesday\")\n    elif day == \"thursday\":\n        print(\"Thursday\")\n    elif day == \"friday\":\n        print(\"Friday\")\n    elif day == \"saturday\":\n        print(\"Saturday\")\n    elif day == \"sunday\":\n        print(\"Sunday\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid day of the week. Please enter a day between monday and sunday.\")\n\ndef main():\n    day = input(\"Enter a day of the week (in lowercase): \").lower()\n    print_day_of_week(day)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program will ask the user to enter a day of the week and then print it out. If the user enters an invalid day, it will print an error message.\n\nHowever, please note that using if/else statements for this purpose is not the most efficient way. A better approach would be to use a dictionary to map the input to the corresponding day of the week. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ndef print_day_of_week(day):\n    days = {\n        \"monday\": \"Monday\",\n        \"tuesday\": \"Tuesday\",\n        \"wednesday\": \"Wednesday\",\n        \"thursday\": \"Thursday\",\n        \"friday\": \"Friday\",\n        \"saturday\": \"Saturday\",\n        \"sunday\": \"Sunday\"\n    }\n    print(days.get(day.lower(), \"Invalid day of the week. Please enter a day between monday and sunday.\"))\n\ndef main():\n    day = input(\"Enter a day of the week (in any case): \")\n    print_day_of_week(day)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version of the program will achieve the same result but with more concise and efficient code.",
