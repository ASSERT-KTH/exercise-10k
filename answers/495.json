  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of pairs as input, and returns two separate lists containing the first and second elements of each pair.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef separate(x):\n    first = [i[0] for i in x]\n    second = [i[1] for i in x]\n    return first, second\n\npairs = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]\nfirst, second = separate(pairs)\nprint(first)  # [1, 3, 5]\nprint(second)  # [2, 4, 6]\n```\nThis code defines the `separate` function, uses it to process the `pairs` list, and prints the resulting lists `first` and `second`.",
