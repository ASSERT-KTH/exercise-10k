  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return \"List is empty\"\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    \n    return average\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"The average of the list is:\", calculate_average(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of those numbers.\n2. **Error Handling**: The function checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns a message indicating that the list is empty.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The function uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The function calculates the average by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of numbers in the list.\n5. **Example Usage**: The program demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with a sample list of numbers and prints the calculated average.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always validate user input to prevent errors. In this case, the program checks if the input list is empty.\n* Use built-in functions like `sum` to simplify calculations and improve code readability.\n* Consider adding more error handling to make the program more robust. For example, you could check if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are numbers.",
