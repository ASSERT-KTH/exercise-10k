  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out whether they are eligible to vote or not. The voting age is 18. If the user is 18 or older, print 'You are eligible to vote.' Otherwise, print 'You are not eligible to vote.'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for their age and prints whether they are eligible to vote.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the user's age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Check if the user is eligible to vote\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_voting_eligibility()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your age when prompted.\n3. The program will print whether you are eligible to vote based on your age.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `check_voting_eligibility` that asks the user for their age.\n2. It uses a `try-except` block to ensure the input is a whole number. If not, it prompts the user to try again.\n3. Once it has a valid age, it checks if the age is 18 or older.\n4. Based on the age, it prints whether the user is eligible to vote.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block calls the `check_voting_eligibility` function when the program is run directly.",
