  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a simple bank, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that simulates a bank account:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1.  **BankAccount class**: This class represents a bank account. It has methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n2.  **`__init__` method**: Initializes the bank account with an initial balance (default is 0).\n3.  **`deposit` method**: Adds the specified amount to the balance if it's positive.\n4.  **`withdraw` method**: Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if it's positive and doesn't exceed the current balance.\n5.  **`check_balance` method**: Displays the current balance.\n6.  **`main` function**: Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with their bank account. It creates a `BankAccount` instance and allows users to deposit, withdraw, check their balance, or quit the program.\n\n### Example usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to deposit money into your account. Enter a positive amount when prompted.\n3.  Choose option 2 to withdraw money from your account. Enter a positive amount that doesn't exceed your current balance when prompted.\n4.  Choose option 3 to check your current balance.\n5.  Choose option 4 to quit the program.",
