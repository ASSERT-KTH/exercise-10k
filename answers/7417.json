  "prompt": "Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score as an argument and returns the corresponding grade. The grade is calculated based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not a number or is not within the valid range of 0 to 100.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that calculates a student's grade based on their score, handling various input scenarios and returning the corresponding grade. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade for the given score.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input score is not a number\n    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input score must be a number.\")\n\n    # Then, we check if the input score is not within the valid range of 0 to 100\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n\n    # Now, we calculate the grade based on the given scale\n    # If the score is between 90 and 100, the grade is A\n    if 90 <= score <= 100:\n        return \"A\"\n    \n    # If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B\n    elif 80 <= score < 90:\n        return \"B\"\n    \n    # If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C\n    elif 70 <= score < 80:\n        return \"C\"\n    \n    # If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D\n    elif 60 <= score < 70:\n        return \"D\"\n    \n    # If the score is below 60, the grade is F\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_grade(95))  # Output: A\nprint(calculate_grade(85))  # Output: B\nprint(calculate_grade(75))  # Output: C\nprint(calculate_grade(65))  # Output: D\nprint(calculate_grade(55))  # Output: F\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_grade` first checks if the input `score` is not a number using `isinstance(score, (int, float))`, raising a `TypeError` if it's not.\n* It then checks if the `score` is within the valid range of 0 to 100, raising a `ValueError` if it's not.\n* The function calculates the grade based on the given scale using if-elif-else statements, returning the corresponding grade as a string (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F').\n* Example use cases are provided to demonstrate the function's usage, such as `print(calculate_grade(95))` to test the function with a score of 95.",
