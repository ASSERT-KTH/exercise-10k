  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the minimum value:\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the minimum value in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum value in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"List cannot be empty\")\n\n    return min(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]\nprint(find_minimum(numbers))  # Output: 7\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function called `find_minimum` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n- We check if the list is empty. If it is, we raise a `ValueError` because we can't find the minimum value of an empty list.\n- We use the built-in `min` function to find the minimum value in the list.\n- We include a docstring to explain what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.\n- We provide an example usage of the function with a list of numbers and print the result.",
