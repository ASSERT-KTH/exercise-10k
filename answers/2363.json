  "answer": "**Subtraction Quiz Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program will ask the user a series of subtraction questions and keep track of the score. The program will generate random numbers for the subtraction questions and check if the user's answer is correct.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef subtraction_quiz(num_questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ask the user a series of subtraction questions and keep track of the score.\n\n    Args:\n        num_questions (int): The number of questions to ask.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for i in range(num_questions):\n        num1 = random.randint(1, 100)\n        num2 = random.randint(1, num1)  # Ensure num2 is less than or equal to num1\n        correct_answer = num1 - num2\n\n        user_answer = input(f\"What is {num1} - {num2}? \")\n        try:\n            user_answer = int(user_answer)\n            if user_answer == correct_answer:\n                print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n                score += 1\n            else:\n                print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {correct_answer}.\\n\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's not a valid answer. The correct answer is {correct_answer}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! You scored {score} out of {num_questions}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    num_questions = int(input(\"How many questions would you like to answer? \"))\n    subtraction_quiz(num_questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of questions you would like to answer when prompted.\n3. Answer each subtraction question to the best of your ability.\n4. The program will keep track of your score and display it at the end of the quiz.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `subtraction_quiz` function takes an integer `num_questions` as input, which specifies the number of questions to ask.\n* The `random.randint` function is used to generate random numbers for the subtraction questions.\n* The program checks if the user's answer is correct and increments the score if it is.\n* The program handles invalid input (e.g., non-integer answers) by displaying an error message and moving on to the next question.",
