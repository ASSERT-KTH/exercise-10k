  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a math operation and two numbers as input. Use if/else statements to perform the correct operation and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs basic math operations based on user input.\n\n```python\ndef math_operation():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the math operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform math operation\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid math operation.\")\n\n# Call the function\nmath_operation()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **User Input**: The program starts by asking the user to input two numbers and a math operation.\n2. **Operation Selection**: The program uses if/else statements to select the correct math operation based on the user's input.\n3. **Math Operation**: The program performs the selected math operation and stores the result in the `result` variable.\n4. **Result Printing**: The program prints the result of the math operation.\n5. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling for division by zero and invalid math operations.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Addition: `Enter the first number: 10`, `Enter the math operation: +`, `Enter the second number: 5`\n* Subtraction: `Enter the first number: 15`, `Enter the math operation: -`, `Enter the second number: 3`\n* Multiplication: `Enter the first number: 4`, `Enter the math operation: *`, `Enter the second number: 9`\n* Division: `Enter the first number: 12`, `Enter the math operation: /`, `Enter the second number: 4`",
