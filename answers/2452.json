  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    flat_list = []\n    for element in nested_list:\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))\n        else:\n            flat_list.append(element)\n    return flat_list\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7, [8, 9]]\nprint(flatten_list(numbers))\n```\nThis code defines a recursive function `flatten_list` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists. The function uses a loop to iterate over each element in the input list, and checks if the element is a list or not. If it's a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten the sublist. If it's not a list, it appends the element to the output list.\n\nThe code also defines a list of lists `numbers` and calls the `flatten_list` function with this list as an argument, printing the result to the console. The output should be a new list containing all elements from the sublists, in the correct order.",
