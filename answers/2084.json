  "answer": "**Distance Calculator in 2D Plane**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        x1 (float): x-coordinate of the first point\n        y1 (float): y-coordinate of the first point\n        x2 (float): x-coordinate of the second point\n        y2 (float): y-coordinate of the second point\n\n    Returns:\n        float: distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    x1, y1 = 1, 2\n    x2, y2 = 4, 6\n    distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n    print(f\"The distance between ({x1}, {y1}) and ({x2}, {y2}) is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes four arguments: the x and y coordinates of the two points.\n2. It uses the Euclidean distance formula: `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)` to calculate the distance.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`).\n2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`).\n3. The program will output the distance between the two points.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` module for the `sqrt` function. Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run this program.",
