  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades. The function should take a list of grades as input, calculate the average, and return the average grade. If the list is empty, return a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades, addressing your request for a comprehensive solution. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade if the list is not empty, otherwise a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the list is empty\n    if not grades:\n        # If the list is empty, we return a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate\n        return \"There are no grades to calculate.\"\n\n    # If the list is not empty, we calculate the sum of all grades\n    # We use the built-in sum function in Python to calculate the sum of all elements in the list\n    total_grades = sum(grades)\n    \n    # Then, we calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades\n    # We use the len function to get the number of elements in the list\n    average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the average grade\n    return average_grade\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = [90, 85, 95, 88, 92]\nprint(calculate_average_grade(grades))  # Output: 90.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average_grade` takes a list of grades as input and first checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns a message indicating that there are no grades to calculate.\n* If the list is not empty, it calculates the sum of all grades using the built-in `sum` function and stores it in the `total_grades` variable.\n* Then, it calculates the average grade by dividing the sum of grades (`total_grades`) by the number of grades, obtained using the `len` function, and stores it in the `average_grade` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated `average_grade`.",
