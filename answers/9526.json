  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a pattern of numbers based on the input provided. The pattern should be generated using a nested loop structure. The outer loop should run for the number of rows provided, and the inner loop should run for the number of columns provided. The numbers in the pattern should be incremented by 1 for each position, starting from 1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that meets the specifications:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(1, 6):\n        print(j + (i - 1) * 5, end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nThis code uses two nested `for` loops to generate the pattern, with the outer loop iterating over the rows and the inner loop iterating over the columns. The `print` statement inside the inner loop prints the current number in the pattern, which is calculated using the formula `j + (i - 1) * 5`. The `end=' '` parameter is used to print the numbers separated by a space, and the `print()` statement at the end of the outer loop is used to print a newline character after each row.",
