  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array and a number of positions as input and returns a new array containing the same elements, but rotated by the specified number of positions.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that satisfies the given specification:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates the input list by k positions to the right.\n\n    :param nums: The input list to be rotated.\n    :param k: The number of positions to rotate the list.\n    :return: None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the effective number of rotations, considering the length of the list\n    k = k % len(nums)\n    \n    # Reverse the entire list\n    nums.reverse()\n    \n    # Reverse the first k elements\n    nums[:k] = nums[:k][::-1]\n    \n    # Reverse the rest of the list (from index k to the end)\n    nums[k:] = nums[k:][::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nk = 3\nrotate(nums, k)\nprint(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `rotate` that takes a list `nums` and an integer `k` as input, and rotates the list `nums` to the right by `k` positions. The rotation is done in-place, modifying the original list. The example usage at the end demonstrates the function's behavior with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, resulting in the rotated list `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.",
