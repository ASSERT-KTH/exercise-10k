  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to find the maximum number correctly even if it appears multiple times in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef max_number(numbers):\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number > max_num:\n            max_num = number\n    return max_num\n\ndef main():\n    print(max_number([10, 5, 8, 22, 6, 12, 15]))\n    print(max_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n    print(max_number([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]))\n    print(max_number([10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to write this code. The `max_number` function iterates through the list of numbers, keeping track of the maximum number found so far, and returns the maximum number at the end. The `main` function tests the `max_number` function with four different examples, and the code is wrapped in an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.",
