  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer grade as input and outputs whether it is passing or failing based on the following conditions: grade 70 and above is passing, below 70 is failing. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a grade is passing or failing.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (int): The grade to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: \"Passing\" if the grade is 70 or above, \"Failing\" otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade >= 70:\n        return \"Passing\"\n    else:\n        return \"Failing\"\n\n# Example usage:\ngrade = int(input(\"Enter your grade: \"))\nresult = check_grade(grade)\nprint(f\"Your grade is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. We define a function `check_grade` that takes an integer `grade` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if the `grade` is greater than or equal to 70.\n3. If the condition is true, we return the string \"Passing\".\n4. If the condition is false, we return the string \"Failing\" using the `else` clause.\n5. In the example usage, we take an integer input from the user, pass it to the `check_grade` function, and print the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Define the function `check_grade` with an integer parameter `grade`.\n2. Use an `if` statement to check the condition `grade >= 70`.\n3. Return \"Passing\" if the condition is true, and \"Failing\" otherwise.\n4. Take an integer input from the user and pass it to the `check_grade` function.\n5. Print the result returned by the function.\n\n### Advice:\n\n* Always validate user input to ensure it meets the expected format and range.\n* Consider adding error handling to handle unexpected input or edge cases.\n* Use descriptive variable names and comments to improve code readability and maintainability.",
