  "prompt": "Create a simple program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the specified operation. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not supported.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If division by zero is attempted.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'add':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtract':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiply':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'divide':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Available operations:\")\n    print(\"1. Add\")\n    print(\"2. Subtract\")\n    print(\"3. Multiply\")\n    print(\"4. Divide\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter the number of your chosen operation: \")\n\n    operations = {\n        '1': 'add',\n        '2': 'subtract',\n        '3': 'multiply',\n        '4': 'divide'\n    }\n\n    if choice in operations:\n        try:\n            result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operations[choice])\n            print(f\"The result of the operation is {result}\")\n        except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n            print(str(e))\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. The `arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the specified operation, and returns the result.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an operation.\n3. Based on the user's choice, it calls the `arithmetic_operation` function with the chosen operation and prints the result.\n4. It handles invalid operations and division by zero by raising exceptions.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Adding two numbers: Input `10` and `5` as the numbers, and choose `Add` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 15.0`.\n* Subtracting two numbers: Input `10` and `5` as the numbers, and choose `Subtract` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 5.0`.\n* Multiplying two numbers: Input `10` and `5` as the numbers, and choose `Multiply` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 50.0`.\n* Dividing two numbers: Input `10` and `2` as the numbers, and choose `Divide` as the operation. The output will be `The result of the operation is 5.0`.",
