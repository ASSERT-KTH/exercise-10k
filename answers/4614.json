  "answer": "**Triangle Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. It uses the formula: `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers.\")\n\n    area = (base * height) / 2\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two arguments: `base` and `height`.\n2. It checks if both `base` and `height` are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_triangle_area` function.\n5. It prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.\n6. It calls the `calculate_triangle_area` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6:\n    + Input: `base = 5`, `height = 6`\n    + Output: `The area of the triangle is: 15.00`\n* Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 and a height of 8:\n    + Input: `base = 10`, `height = 8`\n    + Output: `The area of the triangle is: 40.00`",
