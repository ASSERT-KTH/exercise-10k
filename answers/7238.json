  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop, then prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    // Using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n        cout << i << endl;\n    }\n\n    // Using a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1\n    int j = 10;\n    while (j >= 1) {\n        cout << j << endl;\n        j--;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified in the breakdown:\n\n1. It includes the necessary header file `iostream` and uses the `std` namespace.\n2. It defines the `main` function as the entry point of the program.\n3. It uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.\n4. It uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 to 1.\n5. It returns an integer value (0) to indicate successful execution.\n\nWhen run, this program will print the numbers from 1 to 10, followed by the numbers from 10 to 1, as described in the specification.",
