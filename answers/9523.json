  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take two numbers and an operator as input and then call the corresponding function to perform the operation.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# Define a function for addition\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Define a function for subtraction\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Define a function for multiplication\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\n# Define a function for division\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\n# Define a main function to handle user input and call the corresponding function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1.

These functions take two numbers as input and return the result of the operation.\n*   In the `divide` function, we check if the second number is zero to prevent division by zero errors. If it is, we raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   The `main` function serves as the program's entry point. It displays a menu for the user to select an arithmetic operation and prompts them to enter two numbers.\n*   Based on the user's choice, the `main` function calls the corresponding arithmetic function and prints the result. If the user attempts to divide by zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and displays an error message.\n*   Finally, we use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display a menu with options for basic arithmetic operations. You can select an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.). Then, you will be prompted to enter two numbers. The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.\n\nFor example, if you choose addition and enter 5 and 3, the program will output: `5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0`",
