  "prompt": "Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    if 0 <= score <= 100:\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to enter a score, checks if the score is valid (between 0 and 100), and then calls the `calculate_grade` function to determine the grade.\n*   The program handles invalid scores by displaying an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Enter a score of 92: The output will be \"The student's grade is: A\"\n*   Enter a score of 85: The output will be \"The student's grade is: B\"\n*   Enter a score of 75: The output will be \"The student's grade is: C\"\n*   Enter a score of 65: The output will be \"The student's grade is: D\"\n*   Enter a score of 55: The output will be \"The student's grade is: F\"\n*   Enter a score of 105: The output will be \"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\"",
