  "answer": "**Minimum Number of Coins Problem**\n=====================================\n\n**Problem Statement**\n--------------------\n\nGiven a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the change.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming.\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `amount + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make `i` units of change.\n2. Initialize `dp[0] = 0`, since we need 0 coins to make 0 units of change.\n3. For each coin denomination `c`:\n   1. For each amount `i` from `c` to `amount`:\n      1. If `dp[i - c]` is not null and `dp[i - c] + 1` is less than `dp[i]`, update `dp[i] = dp[i - c] + 1`.\n4. Return `dp[amount]`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change.\n\n    Args:\n    coins (list): A list of coin denominations.\n    amount (int): The target amount.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize dp array\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # We need 0 coins to make 0 units of change\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for c in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from c to amount\n        for i in range(c, amount + 1):\n            # Update dp[i] if we can make i units of change with fewer coins\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)\n\n    # Return the minimum number of coins needed\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n# Example usage\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `min_coins` function takes a list of coin denominations and a target amount as input.\n*   It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount.\n*   The function then iterates over each coin denomination and updates the `dp` array accordingly.\n*   Finally, it returns the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount, or -1 if it's not possible to make the change.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the target amount and len(coins) is the number of coin denominations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(amount), since we need to store the `dp` array of size `amount + 1`.",
