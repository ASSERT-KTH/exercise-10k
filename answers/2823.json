  "prompt": "Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that will determine whether a given year is a leap year or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the given year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n1. The program first defines a helper function `is_leap_year(year)` that checks whether a year is a leap year according to the given rules.\n2. The `main()` function asks the user to enter a year, and then calls `is_leap_year(year)` to determine whether the given year is a leap year.\n3. Finally, the program prints out whether the given year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Explanation of the rules\n- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n- However, years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless...\n- They are also divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years.\n\n### Example use cases\n- The year 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400.\n- The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n- The year 2020 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.\n- The year 2021 is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 4.",
