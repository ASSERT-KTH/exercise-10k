  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that are both even and greater than 5.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef new_list(numbers):\n    new_numbers = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > 5 and num % 2 == 0:\n            new_numbers.append(num)\n    return new_numbers\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20]\n    print(new_list(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, defining the `new_list` function and the `main` function, and using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly. The `new_list` function filters the input list to include only numbers that are both even and greater than 5, and the `main` function demonstrates its usage with a sample list.",
