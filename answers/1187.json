  "answer": "**Book Price Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the price of a book after applying a discount. The program takes two inputs:\n\n* `original_price`: the original price of the book\n* `discount_percentage`: the discount percentage to be applied\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_book_price(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the price of a book after applying a discount.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the book.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage to be applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The price of the book after applying the discount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if original_price < 0 or discount_percentage < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Original price and discount percentage cannot be negative\")\n\n    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage\n    price_after_discount = original_price - discount_amount\n\n    return price_after_discount\n\n\ndef main():\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price of the book: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    try:\n        price_after_discount = calculate_book_price(original_price, discount_percentage)\n        print(f\"The price of the book after applying a {discount_percentage}% discount is: ${price_after_discount:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_book_price` function takes two arguments: `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n2. It checks if the `original_price` and `discount_percentage` are non-negative. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the `original_price` by the `discount_percentage` divided by 100.\n4. It calculates the price after discount by subtracting the discount amount from the `original_price`.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to input the `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n6. It calls the `calculate_book_price` function with the user input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the original price of the book: 100\nEnter the discount percentage: 20\nThe price of the book after applying a 20.0% discount is: $80.00\n```",
