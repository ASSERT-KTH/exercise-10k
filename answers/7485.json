  "answer": "**Set Intersection Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the intersection of two sets, which is a set containing all elements that are present in both sets.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef set_intersection(set1, set2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the intersection of two sets.\n\n    Args:\n        set1 (set): The first set.\n        set2 (set): The second set.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: The intersection of set1 and set2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set1 & set2\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n    intersection = set_intersection(set1, set2)\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `set_intersection` function takes two sets as input and returns their intersection using the `&` operator.\n*   In the `main` function, we define two example sets `set1` and `set2`.\n*   We call the `set_intersection` function with these sets and print the result.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nIntersection: {4, 5}\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This program assumes that the input sets are valid Python sets. If you need to work with other data structures or types, you may need to modify the code accordingly.\n*   The `&` operator is used for set intersection in Python, which is a concise and efficient way to find the common elements between two sets.",
