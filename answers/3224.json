  "answer": "**Binary Search Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It works by dividing the list in half and repeatedly searching for the element in one of the two halves until it is found.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted list using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Algorithm Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the sorted list, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n3.  Compare the middle element `sorted_list[mid]` with the target element `target`.\n    *   If they are equal, return the middle index `mid`.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until `low` is greater than `high`.\n5.  If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case time complexity: O(1) when the target element is at the middle index.\n*   Average-case time complexity: O(log n) when the target element is randomly located in the list.\n*   Worst-case time complexity: O(log n) when the target element is at the first or last index.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the target element.",
