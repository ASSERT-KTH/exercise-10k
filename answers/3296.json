  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the GCD of two numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a for loop.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the smaller number\n    smaller_num = min(num1, num2)\n\n    # Initialize GCD as 1\n    gcd = 1\n\n    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to the smaller number\n    for i in range(2, smaller_num + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of both numbers\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:\n            # Update GCD\n            gcd = i\n\n    return gcd\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {calculate_gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works by iterating through all numbers from 2 to the smaller of the two input numbers, and checking if each number is a divisor of both input numbers. If it is, the program updates the GCD to that number. The GCD is then returned as the result.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple and inefficient way to calculate the GCD, especially for large numbers. A more efficient way would be to use the Euclidean algorithm or the `math.gcd()` function in Python.",
