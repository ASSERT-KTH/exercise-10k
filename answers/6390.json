  "answer": "**Odd-Even Number Classifier Program**\n\nThis program takes an array of integers as input, classifies each number as odd or even, and prints out the corresponding numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef classify_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify numbers as odd or even and print out the corresponding numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    odd_numbers = []\n    even_numbers = []\n\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # If the remainder of num divided by 2 is 0, it's even\n            even_numbers.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, it's odd\n            odd_numbers.append(num)\n\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n    print(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    classify_numbers(numbers)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `classify_numbers` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It initializes two empty lists, `odd_numbers` and `even_numbers`, to store the classified numbers.\n3. It iterates over each number in the input list.\n4. For each number, it checks whether the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0 using the modulus operator (`%`).\n5. If the remainder is 0, it appends the number to the `even_numbers` list. Otherwise, it appends the number to the `odd_numbers` list.\n6. Finally, it prints out the even numbers and odd numbers.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to use if-else statements to classify numbers as odd or even and store them in separate lists. You can modify the `main` function to test the program with different input arrays.",
