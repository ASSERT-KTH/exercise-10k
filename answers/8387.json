  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the nth Pell number using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef pell_number(n):\n    # Create a list to store the Pell numbers\n    pell = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Initialize the first two Pell numbers\n    if n >= 0:\n        pell[0] = 0\n    if n >= 1:\n        pell[1] = 1\n\n    # Calculate the remaining Pell numbers\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        pell[i] = 2 * pell[i - 1] + pell[i - 2]\n\n    # Return the nth Pell number\n    return pell[n]\n\n# Test the function\nn = int(input(\"Enter the value of n: \"))\nprint(f\"The {n}th Pell number is: {pell_number(n)}\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `pell_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Pell number.\n*   It initializes a list `pell` of size `n + 1` to store the Pell numbers.\n*   The first two Pell numbers are initialized: `pell[0] = 0` and `pell[1] = 1`.\n*   The function then uses a loop to calculate the remaining Pell numbers based on the recurrence relation: `pell[i] = 2 * pell[i - 1] + pell[i - 2]`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `n`th Pell number, which is stored in `pell[n]`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the input number.\n*   This is because the program uses a single loop to calculate the Pell numbers up to the `n`th number.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the input number.\n*   This is because the program uses a list of size `n + 1` to store the Pell numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   To calculate the 5th Pell number, you can call the `pell_number` function with `n = 5`. The output will be `29`.\n*   To calculate the 10th Pell number, you can call the `pell_number` function with `n = 10`. The output will be `2378`.",
