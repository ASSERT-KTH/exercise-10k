  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the discount amount based on the total price of an item. The discount rules are as follows:\n\n* If the total price is above $100, a 10% discount is applied.\n* If the total price is between $50 and $100, a 5% discount is applied.\n* If the total price is below $50, no discount is applied.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(total_price):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the discount amount based on the total price.\n\n    Args:\n        total_price (float): The total price of the item.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discount amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if total_price > 100:\n        discount_percentage = 0.10\n    elif 50 <= total_price <= 100:\n        discount_percentage = 0.05\n    else:\n        discount_percentage = 0.00\n\n    discount_amount = total_price * discount_percentage\n    return discount_amount\n\ndef main():\n    total_price = float(input(\"Enter the total price: $\"))\n    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_price)\n    print(f\"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Price after discount: ${total_price - discount_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the total price is $120, the discount amount will be $12.00 (10% of $120), and the price after discount will be $108.00.\n* If the total price is $75, the discount amount will be $3.75 (5% of $75), and the price after discount will be $71.25.\n* If the total price is $30, the discount amount will be $0.00 (no discount), and the price after discount will be $30.00.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `discount_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program by typing `python discount_calculator.py`.\n4. Enter the total price when prompted, and the program will calculate and display the discount amount and the price after discount.",
