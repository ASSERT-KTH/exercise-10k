Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences, where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`.\n2.  Fill the 2D array using dynamic programming:\n\n    *   If `str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]`, it means the current characters match, so the length of the common subsequence increases by 1.\n    *   Otherwise, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum of the lengths without considering the current characters in either `str1` or `str2`.\n3.  Reconstruct the longest common subsequence from the 2D array:\n\n    *   Start from the bottom-right corner of the 2D array and move diagonally up-left if the current characters match.\n    *   If the characters do not match, move up or left depending on which direction has a longer common subsequence.\n4.  Return the longest common subsequence as a string by joining the characters in the `lcs` list in reverse order.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings, and a space complexity of O(m \\* n) due to the 2D array.",
