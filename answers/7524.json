  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in three subjects: math, science, and english. The program should define a function to calculate the average score and another function to determine the grade based on the average score. The grade should be determined as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the average score\ndef average(score1, score2, score3):\n    avg = (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3\n    return avg\n\n# Define a function to calculate the grade based on the average score\ndef grade(avg):\n    # Check the average score and return the corresponding grade\n    if avg >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif avg >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif avg >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif avg >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user to enter their scores\n    score1 = float(input(\"Enter your math score: \"))\n    score2 = float(input(\"Enter your science score: \"))\n    score3 = float(input(\"Enter your english score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the average score\n    avg = average(score1, score2, score3)\n\n    # Calculate the grade based on the average score\n    grade1 = grade(avg)\n\n    # Print the average score and grade\n    print(\"Your average score is: {:.2f}\".format(avg))\n    print(\"Your grade is: {}\".format(grade1))\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code defines the `average` function to calculate the average score, the `grade` function to calculate the grade based on the average score, and the `main` function to handle user input, calculate the average score and grade, and print the results. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block calls the `main` function when the script is run directly.",
