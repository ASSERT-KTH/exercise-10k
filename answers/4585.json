  "answer": "**Function to Find Maximum Value in a List**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_max_value(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the maximum value in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        max_value (float): The maximum value in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    max_value = max(numbers)\n    return max_value\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmax_value = find_max_value(numbers)\nprint(\"Maximum value:\", max_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `find_max_value` takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   It checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The built-in `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list.\n*   The maximum value is returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, a list of numbers is created, and the `find_max_value` function is called with this list as input. The maximum value is then printed.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Always check for potential errors, such as an empty input list.\n*   Use built-in functions like `max` when possible, as they are often more efficient and easier to read.\n*   Include docstrings to provide documentation for your functions, including descriptions, argument explanations, return values, and raised exceptions.",
