  "answer": "**Sequence Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is part of a simple sequence, such as even numbers, multiples of 3, or multiples of a user-defined number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_even(number):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is even.\"\"\"\n    return number % 2 == 0\n\ndef is_multiple_of_3(number):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a multiple of 3.\"\"\"\n    return number % 3 == 0\n\ndef is_multiple_of_n(number, n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a multiple of n.\"\"\"\n    return number % n == 0\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Sequence Checker Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    print(f\"Is {num} even? {is_even(num)}\")\n    print(f\"Is {num} a multiple of 3? {is_multiple_of_3(num)}\")\n\n    n = int(input(\"Enter a number to check for multiples (or 0 to skip): \"))\n    if n != 0:\n        print(f\"Is {num} a multiple of {n}? {is_multiple_of_n(num, n)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Check if a number is even:\n\t* Input: `10`\n\t* Output: `Is 10 even? True`\n2. Check if a number is a multiple of 3:\n\t* Input: `9`\n\t* Output: `Is 9 a multiple of 3? True`\n3. Check if a number is a multiple of a user-defined number:\n\t* Input: `12`, `4`\n\t* Output: `Is 12 a multiple of 4? True`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines three functions: `is_even`, `is_multiple_of_3`, and `is_multiple_of_n`.\n2. Each function takes a number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number meets the sequence condition.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and then checks the number against the even and multiple of 3 sequences.\n4. The user is also asked to enter a number to check for multiples (or 0 to skip).\n5. The program prints the results of each sequence check.\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the program to check for additional sequences by adding new functions and calling them in the `main` function.\n* You can also use this program as a starting point to create more complex sequence checkers, such as checking for prime numbers or Fibonacci numbers.",
