  "prompt": "Write a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (integer, float, character, string) and then prints their values. Use meaningful variable names and include comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I can help you write the code. Here is the code in Python:\n```\n# Declaration and Initialization\nintegerVariable = 10\nfloatVariable = 3.14159\ncharVariable = 'A'\nstringVariable = \"This is a string variable\"\n\n# Printing the Values\nprint(integerVariable)\nprint(floatVariable)\nprint(charVariable)\nprint(stringVariable)\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified:\n\n1. It declares and initializes four variables with different data types:\n\t* `integerVariable` is an integer with value 10.\n\t* `floatVariable` is a floating-point number with value 3.14159.\n\t* `charVariable` is a character with value 'A'.\n\t* `stringVariable` is a string with value \"This is a string variable\".\n2. It prints the values of the four variables using the `print()` statement.\n\nNote that in Python, the `char` data type is not explicitly defined, and single characters are represented as strings. Therefore, `charVariable` is a string containing a single character 'A'.",
