  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a character as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint count(char string[], char ch) {\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(string); i++) {\n        if (string[i] == ch) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char string[] = \"hello\";\n    char ch = 'l';\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count(string, ch));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code defines a function `count` that takes a string and a character as input, iterates over the string, and counts the number of occurrences of the character. The `main` function creates a string and a character, calls the `count` function, and prints the result to the console.",
