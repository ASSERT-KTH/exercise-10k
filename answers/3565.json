  "answer": "**Filtering a Dictionary**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python function that filters a dictionary based on a given condition and returns the filtered dictionary.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_dict(input_dict, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a dictionary based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The filtered dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if condition(key, value)}\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a sample dictionary\n    sample_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3, \"d\": 4}\n\n    # Define a condition function\n    def condition(key, value):\n        return value > 2\n\n    # Filter the dictionary\n    filtered_dict = filter_dict(sample_dict, condition)\n\n    # Print the filtered dictionary\n    print(filtered_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `filter_dict` function takes two arguments: `input_dict` (the dictionary to be filtered) and `condition` (a function that defines the filtering condition).\n*   The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs for which the `condition` function returns `True`.\n*   The `condition` function is defined separately and should take two arguments (key and value) and return a boolean value indicating whether the key-value pair should be included in the filtered dictionary.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than a certain threshold.\n*   Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the key matches a certain pattern.\n*   Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is of a certain data type.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   When defining the `condition` function, make sure it is concise and readable.\n*   Use meaningful variable names and include comments to explain the purpose of the `condition` function.\n*   Consider using lambda functions for simple conditions, but be aware that they can be less readable for complex conditions.",
