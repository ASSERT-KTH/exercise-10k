  "answer": "**Character Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the first occurrence of a given character in a string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first occurrence of a given character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the character. Returns -1 if the character is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return string.index(char)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\ndef main():\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n\n    index = find_first_occurrence(string, char)\n\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"The first occurrence of '{char}' is at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_first_occurrence` function takes a string and a character as input.\n2. It uses the `index` method of the string to find the first occurrence of the character.\n3. If the character is found, the `index` method returns its index.\n4. If the character is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a string and a character.\n6. It calls the `find_first_occurrence` function and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `string = \"hello\", char = \"l\"`\n  Output: `The first occurrence of 'l' is at index 2.`\n* Input: `string = \"hello\", char = \"x\"`\n  Output: `The character 'x' is not found in the string.`",
