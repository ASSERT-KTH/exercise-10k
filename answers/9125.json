  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input, then performs the specified operation on the numbers and prints the result. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the specified arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        'addition': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtraction': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiplication': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'division': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is supported\n    if operation not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\")\n\n    # Perform the operation and return the result\n    return operations[operation](num1, num2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operation from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Available operations:\")\n    print(\"1.
