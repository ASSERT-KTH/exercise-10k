Run the program and choose option 1 to add a student. Enter the student's name, age, and grade.\n2.  Choose option 4 to display all student records and verify that the added student appears in the list.\n3.  Choose option 3 to update a student's record. Enter the student's name and new age or grade (or both).\n4.  Choose option 2 to remove a student record. Enter the student's name to delete their record.\n5.  Choose option 5 to exit the system.",
