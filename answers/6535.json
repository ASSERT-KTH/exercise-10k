  "answer": "### Calculating Average Grade\n#### Function Description\nThe `calculate_average_grade` function takes a list of students as input, where each student is represented by a dictionary containing their name and grades. The function calculates the average grade for each student and returns a dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student in the list.\n\n    Args:\n    students (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a student's name and grades.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary with student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grades = {}\n    for student in students:\n        name = student['name']\n        grades = student['grades']\n        average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n        average_grades[name] = average_grade\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = [\n    {'name': 'John', 'grades': [90, 80, 70]},\n    {'name': 'Alice', 'grades': [95, 85, 75]},\n    {'name': 'Bob', 'grades': [92, 82, 72]}\n]\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grade(students)\nfor name, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n    print(f\"{name}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n2. Iterate over the list of students.\n3. For each student, extract their name and grades from the dictionary.\n4. Calculate the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n5. Store the average grade in the `average_grades` dictionary with the student's name as the key.\n6. Return the `average_grades` dictionary.\n\n#### Example Output\n```\nJohn: 80.00\nAlice: 85.00\nBob: 82.00\n```",
