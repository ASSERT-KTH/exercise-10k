  "prompt": "Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the screen.",
  "answer": "**Hello World Program**\n========================\n\nBelow is a simple program written in Python that prints 'Hello, World!' to the screen.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints 'Hello, World!' to the screen.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `main` function is defined, which contains the `print` statement.\n2. The `print` function is used to output 'Hello, World!' to the screen.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `hello.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python hello.py`). The output will be:\n```\nHello, World!\n```",
