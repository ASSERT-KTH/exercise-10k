  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input, checks if it contains any digits, and if not, reverses the string. The program should print 'Invalid input' if the string contains digits and the reversed string otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef check(s):\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i].isdigit():\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n    print(s[::-1])\n\ns = input()\ncheck(s)\n```\nThis code defines a function `check` that takes a string `s` as input, checks each character to see if it's a digit, and prints the reversed string if no digits are found. The program then reads a string from the user using the `input` function and passes it to the `check` function.",
