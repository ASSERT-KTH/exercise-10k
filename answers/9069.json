  "answer": "**Temperature Alert Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks the temperature and sends an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_temperature(temperature, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the temperature and sends an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature.\n        threshold (float): The temperature threshold.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature > threshold:\n        print(f\"Temperature alert: {temperature}\u00b0C exceeds the threshold of {threshold}\u00b0C\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Temperature is within normal range: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the temperature and threshold\n    temperature = 35.0  # Current temperature in \u00b0C\n    threshold = 30.0  # Temperature threshold in \u00b0C\n\n    # Check the temperature and send an alert if necessary\n    check_temperature(temperature, threshold)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_temperature` function takes two arguments: `temperature` and `threshold`.\n2. It uses an `if` statement to check if the temperature exceeds the threshold.\n3. If the temperature exceeds the threshold, it prints an alert message.\n4. If the temperature is within the normal range, it prints a message indicating that the temperature is within the normal range.\n5. The `main` function defines the temperature and threshold, and calls the `check_temperature` function.\n6. The program uses a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the program is run directly.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking the temperature in a server room and sending an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold to prevent overheating.\n* Monitoring the temperature in a greenhouse and sending an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold to prevent damage to plants.\n* Checking the temperature in a vehicle and sending an alert if it exceeds a certain threshold to prevent engine damage.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `temperature_alert.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python temperature_alert.py`). You can modify the `temperature` and `threshold` values in the `main` function to test different scenarios.",
