  "answer": "**Password Generator Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random password meeting the specified requirements.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length=8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password of the specified length.\n    The password will contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define character sets\n    uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase\n    lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase\n    digits = string.digits\n\n    # Ensure password has at least one character from each set\n    password = [random.choice(uppercase), random.choice(lowercase), random.choice(digits)]\n\n    # Fill the rest of the password with random characters\n    all_characters = uppercase + lowercase + digits\n    for _ in range(length - 3):\n        password.append(random.choice(all_characters))\n\n    # Shuffle the password to avoid the first three characters always being in the same character set\n    random.shuffle(password)\n\n    # Join the password list into a single string\n    return ''.join(password)\n\ndef main():\n    # Generate and print a password of the default length (8)\n    print(\"Generated Password:\", generate_password())\n\n    # Generate and print a password of a custom length\n    custom_length = 12\n    print(f\"Generated Password ({custom_length} characters):\", generate_password(custom_length))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `generate_password` function takes an optional `length` parameter, defaulting to 8.\n2. It defines the character sets for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.\n3. The function ensures the password has at least one character from each set by selecting one random character from each set.\n4. The rest of the password is filled with random characters from the combined set of all characters.\n5. The password list is shuffled to avoid the first three characters always being in the same character set.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates generating passwords of the default length and a custom length.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nGenerated Password: G4kJP8dL\nGenerated Password (12 characters): 4S8dLpM2aB9eK\n```",
