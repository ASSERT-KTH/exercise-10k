  "answer": "**Structured Data Reader and Writer**\n=====================================\n\nThis program reads and writes data in a structured format using JSON. It includes two main functions: `read_data` and `write_data`.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef read_data(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from a JSON file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): Path to the JSON file.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The data read from the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            data = json.load(file)\n            return data\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n        return None\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        print(f\"Invalid JSON format: {file_path}\")\n        return None\n\ndef write_data(file_path, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes data to a JSON file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): Path to the JSON file.\n        data (dict): The data to be written.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:\n            json.dump(data, file, indent=4)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error writing data: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = \"data.json\"\n    data = {\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"age\": 30,\n        \"city\": \"New York\"\n    }\n\n    # Write data to file\n    write_data(file_path, data)\n\n    # Read data from file\n    read_data_from_file = read_data(file_path)\n    print(read_data_from_file)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `read_data` function takes a file path as input and returns the data read from the file.\n2. It uses the `json.load` function to parse the JSON data from the file.\n3. The `write_data` function takes a file path and data as input and writes the data to the file.\n4. It uses the `json.dump` function to serialize the data to JSON format.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `write_data` and `read_data` functions to write and read data to and from a file.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle exceptions properly when working with files and JSON data.\n* Use the `indent` parameter when writing JSON data to pretty-print the output.\n* Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as logging, in a production environment.",
