  "answer": "**Sports Team Roster Management Program**\n======================================\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program manages a sports team roster and determines player positions based on their skills and preferences. The program uses conditional statements to assign players to positions.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, name, skills, preference):\n        self.name = name\n        self.skills = skills\n        self.preference = preference\n        self.position = None\n\n    def assign_position(self):\n        if self.skills['speed'] > 7 and self.preference == 'offense':\n            self.position = 'Running Back'\n        elif self.skills['strength'] > 7 and self.preference == 'offense':\n            self.position = 'Tight End'\n        elif self.skills['agility'] > 7 and self.preference == 'defense':\n            self.position = 'Cornerback'\n        elif self.skills['intelligence'] > 7 and self.preference == 'defense':\n            self.position = 'Safety'\n        else:\n            self.position = 'Lineman'\n\nclass Team:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.players = []\n\n    def add_player(self, player):\n        self.players.append(player)\n\n    def display_roster(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} Roster:\")\n        for player in self.players:\n            print(f\"{player.name} - {player.position}\")\n\ndef main():\n    team = Team(\"Lions\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\n1. Add Player\")\n        print(\"2. Display Roster\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter player name: \")\n            speed = int(input(\"Enter player speed (1-10): \"))\n            strength = int(input(\"Enter player strength (1-10): \"))\n            agility = int(input(\"Enter player agility (1-10): \"))\n            intelligence = int(input(\"Enter player intelligence (1-10): \"))\n            preference = input(\"Enter player preference (offense/defense): \")\n            player = Player(name, {'speed': speed, 'strength': strength, 'agility': agility, 'intelligence': intelligence}, preference)\n            player.assign_position()\n            team.add_player(player)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            team.display_roster()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to add a player.\n2. Enter the player's name, skills, and preference.\n3. The program will assign the player to a position based on their skills and preference.\n4. Select option 2 to display the team roster and view the player's assigned position.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 to add more players and manage the team roster.\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `Player` class represents a player with attributes for name, skills, preference, and position.\n* The `assign_position` method uses conditional statements to determine the player's position based on their skills and preference.\n* The `Team` class represents a team with attributes for name and players.\n* The `add_player` method adds a player to the team roster.\n* The `display_roster` method displays the team roster with player names and positions.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface to add players, display the roster, and exit the program.",
