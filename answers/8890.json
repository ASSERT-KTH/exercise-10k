  "answer": "**Cylinder Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is `V = \u03c0r\u00b2h`, where `V` is the volume, `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, `r` is the radius, and `h` is the height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cylinder: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cylinder: \"))\n\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cylinder is: {volume:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_cylinder_volume` that takes the radius and height as input and returns the volume.\n2. The function checks if the radius and height are non-negative, raising a `ValueError` if either is negative.\n3. The function calculates the volume using the formula `V = \u03c0r\u00b2h` and returns the result.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage, prompting the user for the radius and height, calculating the volume, and printing the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nRun the program and enter the radius and height of a cylinder when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the radius of the cylinder: 5\nEnter the height of the cylinder: 10\nThe volume of the cylinder is: 785.40\n```",
