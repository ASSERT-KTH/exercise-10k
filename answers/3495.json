  "answer": "**Meter to Feet Converter Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a length in meters as input and returns its equivalent length in feet. It uses the conversion factor of 1 meter = 3.28084 feet.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef meters_to_feet(meters):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a length in meters to feet.\n\n    Args:\n        meters (float): The length in meters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The equivalent length in feet.\n    \"\"\"\n    conversion_factor = 3.28084  # 1 meter = 3.28084 feet\n    feet = meters * conversion_factor\n    return feet\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length in meters from the user\n    meters = float(input(\"Enter a length in meters: \"))\n\n    # Convert the length to feet\n    feet = meters_to_feet(meters)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{meters} meters is equivalent to {feet:.2f} feet.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a length in meters when prompted (e.g., 5).\n3. The program will print the equivalent length in feet (e.g., 5 meters is equivalent to 16.40 feet.).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple conversion factor to convert meters to feet.\n* The result is printed with two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.\n* The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the program's entry point and a separate function `meters_to_feet` to perform the conversion.",
