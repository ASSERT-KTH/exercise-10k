  "prompt": "Write a program to find the maximum value in a list of integers. The program should take a list of integers as input, iterate through the list, and return the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Create a list of integers\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]\n\n# Define a variable to store the maximum value\nmax_value = numbers[0]\n\n# Iterate through the list of numbers\nfor number in numbers:\n    # Check if each number is greater than the current max_value\n    if number > max_value:\n        # If it is, update max_value to be the current number\n        max_value = number\n\n# Print the maximum value\nprint(max_value)\n```\nThis code should output `19`, which is the maximum value in the list. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
