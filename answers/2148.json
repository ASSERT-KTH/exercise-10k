  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two command line arguments, a name and an age, and prints out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes two command line arguments, a name and an age, and prints out a greeting message:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if the user provided exactly two command line arguments\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python greeting.py <name> <age>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    name = sys.argv[1]\n    age = sys.argv[2]\n\n    # Print out a greeting message\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file called `greeting.py` and then run it from the command line like this:\n```bash\npython greeting.py John 30\n```\nThis will print out the message:\n```\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```\nNote: This program does not validate if the age provided is a valid number. If you want to add that validation, you can use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` exception that is raised when the `int()` function is called with a non-numeric string. Here is an updated version of the program with age validation:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if the user provided exactly two command line arguments\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python greeting.py <name> <age>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    name = sys.argv[1]\n    age = sys.argv[2]\n\n    # Validate if the age is a valid number\n    try:\n        age = int(age)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Age must be a valid number\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Print out a greeting message\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
