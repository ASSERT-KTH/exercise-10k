  "answer": "**Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates games of Rock-Paper-Scissors using a while loop. The user can choose to play multiple games or quit the program.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = 'y'\n    user_wins = 0\n    computer_wins = 0\n    ties = 0\n\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \")\n\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n            ties += 1\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win this round.\")\n            user_wins += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins this round.\")\n            computer_wins += 1\n\n        print(f\"\\nScore - You: {user_wins}, Computer: {computer_wins}, Ties: {ties}\")\n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (y/n): \")\n\n    print(\"\\nThanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner of the round will be determined.\n4. The current score will be displayed.\n5. Choose to play again by entering 'y' or quit by entering 'n'.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to simulate the computer's choices. The user's input is validated to ensure it is one of the allowed choices.",
