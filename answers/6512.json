  "answer": "**Set Operations Program**\n================================\n\nThis program performs basic set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\nclass SetOperations:\n    def __init__(self, set1, set2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the SetOperations class with two sets.\n\n        Args:\n            set1 (set): The first set.\n            set2 (set): The second set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.set1 = set1\n        self.set2 = set2\n\n    def union(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the union of the two sets.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The union of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.union(self.set2)\n\n    def intersection(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the intersection of the two sets.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The intersection of the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.set1.intersection(self.set2)\n\n    def difference(self, set1_first=True):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the difference between the two sets.\n\n        Args:\n            set1_first (bool, optional): Whether to calculate set1 - set2 (True) or set2 - set1 (False). Defaults to True.\n\n        Returns:\n            set: The difference between the two sets.\n        \"\"\"\n        if set1_first:\n            return self.set1.difference(self.set2)\n        else:\n            return self.set2.difference(self.set1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create two sets\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    # Create a SetOperations object\n    set_ops = SetOperations(set1, set2)\n\n    # Perform set operations\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Union:\", set_ops.union())\n    print(\"Intersection:\", set_ops.intersection())\n    print(\"Difference (Set 1 - Set 2):\", set_ops.difference())\n    print(\"Difference (Set 2 - Set 1):\", set_ops.difference(set1_first=False))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Output**\n----------------\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nSet 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nIntersection: {3, 4}\nDifference (Set 1 - Set 2): {1, 2}\nDifference (Set 2 - Set 1): {5, 6}\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `SetOperations` class is initialized with two sets, `set1` and `set2`.\n2. The `union` method calculates the union of the two sets using the `union` method of the `set` class.\n3. The `intersection` method calculates the intersection of the two sets using the `intersection` method of the `set` class.\n4. The `difference` method calculates the difference between the two sets using the `difference` method of the `set` class. It takes an optional `set1_first` argument to specify whether to calculate `set1 - set2` or `set2 - set1`.\n5. In the `main` function, two sets are created, and a `SetOperations` object is created with these sets.\n6. The set operations are performed, and the results are printed to the console.",
