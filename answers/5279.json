  "answer": "**Bus Fare Calculator Program**\n\n### Program Overview\n\nThis program calculates the bus fare based on the distance traveled using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bus_fare(distance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the bus fare based on the distance traveled.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled in kilometers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Bus fare.\n    \"\"\"\n    if distance <= 5:\n        # For distances up to 5 km, the fare is $2\n        return 2.0\n    elif distance <= 10:\n        # For distances between 5 km and 10 km, the fare is $3\n        return 3.0\n    elif distance <= 20:\n        # For distances between 10 km and 20 km, the fare is $5\n        return 5.0\n    else:\n        # For distances above 20 km, the fare is $7\n        return 7.0\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Bus Fare Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n    \n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: \"))\n    \n    fare = calculate_bus_fare(distance)\n    \n    print(f\"The bus fare for {distance} km is: ${fare:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance traveled in kilometers when prompted.\n3. The program will display the calculated bus fare.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nBus Fare Calculator Program\n--------------------------------\nEnter the distance traveled in kilometers: 12\nThe bus fare for 12.0 km is: $5.00\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the bus fare based on the distance traveled.\n* The `calculate_bus_fare` function takes the distance as an argument and returns the calculated fare.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output, and calls the `calculate_bus_fare` function to perform the calculation.\n* The program uses a `float` data type to handle decimal distances and fares.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to display the fare with two decimal places.",
