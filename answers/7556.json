  "prompt": "Write a function that takes another function as input and applies it to a given number.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies another function to a given number, as per your request. This will involve defining a higher-order function that takes another function and a number as input and returns the result of applying the given function to the number. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes another function and a number as input.\ndef apply_function(func, num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        num (int or float): The number to which the function is applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of applying the function to the number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a function and a number\n    if not callable(func) or not isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a function and a number\")\n\n    # Apply the function to the number and return the result\n    # We assume that the function can handle the given number as input\n    return func(num)\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a simple function that squares a number\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Apply the square function to the number 5\nresult = apply_function(square, 5)\nprint(result)  # Outputs: 25\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` takes two parameters: `func` (the function to be applied) and `num` (the number to which the function is applied). It first checks if `func` is callable and `num` is a number, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* The function then applies `func` to `num` using the syntax `func(num)`, assuming that `func` can handle `num` as input. This allows for flexible application of various functions to numbers.\n* In the example usage, a simple `square` function is defined, which takes a number `x` and returns its square (`x ** 2`). This `square` function is then passed to `apply_function` along with the number `5`, demonstrating how to apply a specific function to a given number.\n* The result of applying the `square` function to `5` is printed, showcasing the outcome of using the `apply_function` to perform a specific operation on a given input.",
