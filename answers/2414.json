  "answer": "Here is a Python function that uses generators to produce a sequence of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers from 0 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n    \n    Yields:\n        int: The next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        yield i\n\ndef main():\n    n = 10  # Input value\n    print(f\"Generated sequence for n = {n}:\")\n    for num in generate_sequence(n):\n        print(num, end=\" \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_sequence` function is a generator function that takes an integer `n` as input and yields numbers from 0 to `n`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `generate_sequence` function by generating a sequence for a given input value `n` and printing the generated sequence.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this code with `n = 10`, it will print the numbers from 0 to 10:\n\n```\nGenerated sequence for n = 10:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \n```\n\nThis code showcases the use of generators to produce a sequence of numbers, which can be useful for generating large sequences without consuming excessive memory.",
