  "answer": "**Closure Function Example**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that returns another function with access to its own scope. This concept is known as a closure.\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(outer_var):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a function with access to its own scope.\n\n    Args:\n    outer_var (str): The variable accessible from the inner function.\n\n    Returns:\n    function: The inner function with access to the outer function's scope.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def inner_function(inner_var):\n        \"\"\"\n        The inner function with access to the outer function's scope.\n\n        Args:\n        inner_var (str): The variable passed to the inner function.\n\n        Returns:\n        str: A string combining the outer and inner variables.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"Outer variable: {outer_var}, Inner variable: {inner_var}\"\n\n    return inner_function\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a closure by calling the outer function\n    closure = outer_function(\"Hello\")\n\n    # Use the closure to access the outer function's scope\n    print(closure(\"World\"))  # Output: Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  The `outer_function` takes an argument `outer_var` and returns the `inner_function`.\n2.  The `inner_function` has access to the `outer_var` from the `outer_function`'s scope.\n3.  When you call the `outer_function`, it returns the `inner_function`, which becomes a closure.\n4.  The closure can be used to access the `outer_var` from the `outer_function`'s scope, even after the `outer_function` has finished executing.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n1.  **Private Variables:** Closures can be used to create private variables that are only accessible through the returned function.\n2.  **Function Factories:** Closures can be used to create functions with different parameters or behaviors.\n3.  **Higher-Order Functions:** Closures can be used as arguments to higher-order functions or returned as values from functions.",
