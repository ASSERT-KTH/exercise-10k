  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input, reverses the order of its elements, and then sorts the reversed array in ascending order. The program should output the modified array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    int arr[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cin >> arr[i];\n    }\n    reverse(arr, arr + n);\n    sort(arr, arr + n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cout << arr[i] << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that I've used the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is a non-standard header that includes all the standard C++ libraries. This is not recommended in production code, but it's commonly used in competitive programming and coding challenges. If you're writing code for a real-world application, you should use the standard headers instead (e.g. `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.).",
