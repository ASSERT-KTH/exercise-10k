  "prompt": "Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors with the user. The user should be able to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and the program should generate a random choice. The program should then determine the winner and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    user = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \")\n    possibleChoices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    computer = random.choice(possibleChoices)\n\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user}, computer chose {computer}.\\n\")\n\n    if user == computer:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n\n    if is_win(user, computer):\n        return \"You won!\"\n\n    return \"You lost!\"\n\ndef is_win(player, opponent):\n    if (player == \"rock\" and opponent == \"scissors\") or (player == \"scissors\" and opponent == \"paper\") or (player == \"paper\" and opponent == \"rock\"):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nprint(game())\n```\nThis code defines two functions: `game()` and `is_win()`. The `game()` function prompts the user for their choice, generates a random choice for the computer, determines the winner, and returns a string indicating the result. The `is_win()` function takes two arguments, `player` and `opponent`, and returns `True` if the player wins and `False` otherwise.\n\nWhen the program is run, it calls the `game()` function and prints the result to the user.",
