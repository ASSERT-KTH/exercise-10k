  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest earned on a bank deposit based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial deposit amount.\n        rate (float): Annual interest rate (in decimal).\n        time (int): Time period in years.\n        frequency (int): Compounding frequency per year.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total amount after compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n    frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency per year: \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Total amount after {time} years: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound interest earned: ${amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the total amount after the specified time period and the compound interest earned.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula used to calculate compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n) ^ (nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A = Total amount after compound interest\n- P = Principal amount\n- r = Annual interest rate (in decimal)\n- n = Compounding frequency per year\n- t = Time period in years\n\nNote: This program assumes that the interest rate remains constant over the time period.",
