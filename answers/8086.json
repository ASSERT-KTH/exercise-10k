  "answer": "### Creating a Function with a Closure\n#### Overview\nA closure is a function that has access to its own scope, as well as the scope of its outer functions. Here, we'll create a simple function that returns another function with a closure.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a function with a closure.\n    \n    Args:\n        outer_variable (any): The variable to be captured by the closure.\n    \n    Returns:\n        function: A function with access to the outer_variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        \"\"\"\n        The function with a closure.\n        \n        Args:\n            inner_variable (any): The variable to be used by the inner function.\n        \n        Returns:\n            any: The result of combining the outer_variable and inner_variable.\n        \"\"\"\n        # The inner function has access to the outer_variable\n        return f\"Outer variable: {outer_variable}, Inner variable: {inner_variable}\"\n    \n    # Return the inner function, which has a closure\n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a function with a closure\n    func_with_closure = outer_function(\"Hello\")\n\n    # Use the function with a closure\n    print(func_with_closure(\"World\"))  # Output: Outer variable: Hello, Inner variable: World\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `outer_function` takes an `outer_variable` and returns the `inner_function`.\n2. The `inner_function` takes an `inner_variable` and returns a string that combines the `outer_variable` and `inner_variable`.\n3. The `inner_function` has access to the `outer_variable` due to the closure.\n4. In the example usage, we create a function with a closure by calling `outer_function(\"Hello\")`.\n5. We then use the function with a closure by calling `func_with_closure(\"World\")`, which returns the combined string.",
