  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given string. The program should take two strings as input and output the minimum window substring.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef min_window(s, t):\n    if not s or not t:\n        return \"\"\n\n    dict_t = defaultdict(int)\n    for char in t:\n        dict_t[char] += 1\n\n    required = len(dict_t)\n    left = 0\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    min_window = \"\"\n    formed = 0\n\n    window_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        character = s[right]\n        window_counts[character] += 1\n\n        if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:\n            formed += 1\n\n        while left <= right and formed == required:\n            character = s[left]\n\n            if right - left + 1 < min_len:\n                min_len = right - left + 1\n                min_window = s[left:right + 1]\n\n            window_counts[character] -= 1\n            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:\n                formed -= 1\n\n            left += 1\n\n    return min_window\n\n# Test the function\ns = \"ADOBECODEBANC\"\nt = \"ABC\"\nprint(min_window(s, t))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We first create a dictionary `dict_t` to store the frequency of characters in the string `t`.\n*   We then initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.\n*   We also initialize `min_len` to store the minimum length of the window and `min_window` to store the minimum window substring.\n*   We use another dictionary `window_counts` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.\n*   We iterate over the string `s` using the `right` pointer and update the `window_counts` dictionary.\n*   If the frequency of a character in the window is equal to its frequency in `t`, we increment the `formed` variable.\n*   When the `formed` variable is equal to the number of unique characters in `t`, we try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer.\n*   If the length of the current window is less than the minimum length, we update the minimum length and the minimum window substring.\n*   Finally, we return the minimum window substring.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.",
