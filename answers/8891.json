  "answer": "**Calculating the Surface Area of a Sphere**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_surface_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the radius from the user\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the surface area\n        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the sphere is {surface_area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the `math` module**: This is necessary for accessing the constant `math.pi`.\n2. **Define a function to calculate the surface area**: The function `calculate_surface_area` takes the radius as input, checks if it's negative (since a negative radius doesn't make sense), and then calculates the surface area using the formula `4 * \u03c0 * r^2`.\n3. **Create a `main` function**: This function gets the radius from the user, calls `calculate_surface_area`, and prints the result. It also handles any errors that might occur during the calculation.\n4. **Run the program**: When the program is executed, the `main` function is called, and the user is prompted to enter the radius of the sphere.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be asked to enter the radius of the sphere. For example, if you enter `5`, the program will calculate and print the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 5 units.",
