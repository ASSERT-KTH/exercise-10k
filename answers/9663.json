  "answer": "Here is a Python program that asks for a string and a character, and prints out the index of the character in the string.\n\n```python\ndef get_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for a string and a character, and prints out the index of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Please enter a character: \")\n\n    # Check if the character is in the string\n    if char in string:\n        # Find the index of the character\n        index = string.find(char)\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\ndef main():\n    get_index()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we use the built-in `find` method of Python strings to find the index of the character. If the character is not found, `find` returns -1, but we handle this case by checking if the character is in the string first. \n\nNote that this program will print the index of the first occurrence of the character. If you want to print the indices of all occurrences, you would need to use a loop and the `find` method with a start index to search for the next occurrence. \n\nHere is a modified version of the program that prints the indices of all occurrences:\n\n```python\ndef get_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for a string and a character, and prints out the indices of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    char = input(\"Please enter a character: \")\n\n    # Check if the character is in the string\n    if char in string:\n        # Find the indices of the character\n        indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(string) if c == char]\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is found at indices {indices}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\ndef main():\n    get_indices()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version uses a list comprehension to generate a list of indices where the character is found. The `enumerate` function returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over the sequence (`string`).",
