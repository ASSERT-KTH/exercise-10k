  "answer": "### Using Coroutines for Concurrent Tasks\n#### Overview\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses coroutines to perform concurrent tasks. This function utilizes the `asyncio` library, which provides support for asynchronous programming in Python.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n# Define an asynchronous function to simulate a time-consuming task\nasync def task(name, delay):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a time-consuming task.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Task {name} started\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Pause execution for the specified delay\n    print(f\"Task {name} finished\")\n    return f\"Task {name} result\"\n\n# Define an asynchronous function to perform multiple tasks concurrently\nasync def perform_concurrent_tasks(tasks):\n    \"\"\"Perform multiple tasks concurrently using coroutines.\"\"\"\n    # Create a list to store the tasks\n    task_list = []\n    \n    # Create tasks and add them to the list\n    for task_name, delay in tasks:\n        task_list.append(task(task_name, delay))\n    \n    # Use asyncio.gather to run all tasks concurrently\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*task_list)\n    \n    # Return the results\n    return results\n\n# Define the main function to call perform_concurrent_tasks\nasync def main():\n    # Define the input tasks\n    tasks = [(\"A\", 2), (\"B\", 1), (\"C\", 3)]\n    \n    # Call the function to perform concurrent tasks\n    results = await perform_concurrent_tasks(tasks)\n    \n    # Print the results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_time = time.time()\n    asyncio.run(main())\n    print(f\"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   We define two asynchronous functions: `task` and `perform_concurrent_tasks`.\n*   The `task` function simulates a time-consuming task by pausing execution for a specified delay using `asyncio.sleep`.\n*   The `perform_concurrent_tasks` function creates a list of tasks and uses `asyncio.gather` to run all tasks concurrently.\n*   In the `main` function, we define the input tasks and call `perform_concurrent_tasks` to perform them concurrently.\n*   Finally, we print the results and measure the total execution time.\n\n#### Example Use Case\nThis code demonstrates how to use coroutines to perform multiple tasks concurrently. You can modify the `tasks` list in the `main` function to add or remove tasks with different delays. Running the code will show the concurrent execution of tasks and print the results.",
