  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n*   It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes zero.\n*   The GCD is then the absolute value of `a`.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This implementation assumes that the input numbers are integers.\n*   The function uses the `abs` function to handle negative input numbers.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `calculate_gcd` function with two numbers and print the result.",
