  "answer": "**Minimum Element Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the minimum element in an array of integers. It iterates through the array, comparing each element to the current minimum, and updates the minimum as needed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the minimum element in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum element in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not array:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array is empty\")\n\n    minimum = array[0]\n    for element in array:\n        if element < minimum:\n            minimum = element\n\n    return minimum\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    array = [5, 2, 8, 12, 3]\n    minimum = find_minimum(array)\n    print(f\"Minimum element: {minimum}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_minimum` function takes an array as input and checks if it's empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised.\n2. The function initializes the `minimum` variable to the first element of the array.\n3. It then iterates through the array, comparing each element to the current `minimum`. If a smaller element is found, the `minimum` is updated.\n4. Finally, the function returns the minimum element.\n5. In the `main` function, an example array is created, and the `find_minimum` function is called to find the minimum element. The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since it requires a single pass through the array to find the minimum element.",
