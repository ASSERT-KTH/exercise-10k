  "answer": "### Student Grades Calculator\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that creates a list to store student grades and calculates the average grade.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of student grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not grades:\n        return 0.0\n\n    return sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a list to store student grades\n    student_grades = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89]\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(student_grades)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Student Grades:\", student_grades)\n    print(\"Average Grade: {:.2f}\".format(average_grade))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a list of grades as input and returns the average grade.\n2. The `main` function creates a list of student grades and calls the `calculate_average_grade` function to calculate the average.\n3. The result is printed to the console, showing the student grades and the average grade.\n\n#### Example Output\n```\nStudent Grades: [85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89]\nAverage Grade: 86.75\n```\n\nTo use this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python environment, and run it. You can modify the `student_grades` list to store different grades.",
