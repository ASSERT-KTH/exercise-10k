  "answer": "**Bill Splitter Program**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a bill amount and the number of people as input, and prints out the amount each person owes.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_split_bill(bill_amount, num_people):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the amount each person owes.\n\n    Args:\n        bill_amount (float): The total bill amount.\n        num_people (int): The number of people to split the bill.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The amount each person owes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_people <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of people must be greater than zero.\")\n\n    split_amount = bill_amount / num_people\n    return split_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    bill_amount = float(input(\"Enter the bill amount: $\"))\n    num_people = int(input(\"Enter the number of people: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the split bill\n    try:\n        split_amount = calculate_split_bill(bill_amount, num_people)\n        print(f\"Each person owes: ${split_amount:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the bill amount: $100\nEnter the number of people: 4\nEach person owes: $25.00\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_split_bill` function takes the bill amount and number of people as input, and returns the amount each person owes.\n2. The function checks if the number of people is greater than zero, and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n3. The `main` function gets the user input, calls the `calculate_split_bill` function, and prints out the result.\n4. The result is formatted to two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
