  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) to calculate the distance between the two points.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the distance between two cities given their latitude and longitude coordinates.\n* Determine the distance between two points on a graph or chart.\n* Measure the distance between two objects in a 2D space.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* This program assumes a 2D coordinate system. For 3D coordinates, you would need to modify the distance formula accordingly.\n* The program uses the `math` module for the square root calculation.\n* The `calculate_distance` function returns a floating-point number, so you may want to round the result to a specific number of decimal places depending on your use case.",
