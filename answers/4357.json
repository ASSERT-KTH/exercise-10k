  "answer": "### Weather Checker Program\n#### Overview\nThis program checks the current weather and prints a corresponding message.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef check_weather(weather):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the weather and prints a corresponding message.\n\n    Args:\n        weather (str): The current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    weather_conditions = {\n        \"sunny\": \"It's a beautiful day! Enjoy the sunshine.\",\n        \"rainy\": \"Don't forget your umbrella! It's raining outside.\",\n        \"cloudy\": \"The weather is a bit gloomy today. Stay cozy.\",\n        \"snowy\": \"Winter is here! Wrap up warm and enjoy the snow.\",\n        \"windy\": \"Hold onto your hat! It's a windy day today.\",\n        \"foggy\": \"Be careful on the roads. The fog is reducing visibility.\"\n    }\n\n    if weather.lower() in weather_conditions:\n        print(weather_conditions[weather.lower()])\n    else:\n        print(\"Unknown weather condition. Please try again.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    weather_conditions = [\"sunny\", \"rainy\", \"cloudy\", \"snowy\", \"windy\", \"foggy\"]\n    for weather in weather_conditions:\n        print(f\"Weather: {weather.capitalize()}\")\n        check_weather(weather)\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `check_weather` function takes a string argument representing the current weather condition.\n2. It uses a dictionary to map weather conditions to corresponding messages.\n3. The function checks if the input weather condition is in the dictionary. If it is, it prints the corresponding message. Otherwise, it prints an \"Unknown weather condition\" message.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `check_weather` function with different weather conditions.\n\n#### Output\n```\nWeather: Sunny\nIt's a beautiful day! Enjoy the sunshine.\n\nWeather: Rainy\nDon't forget your umbrella! It's raining outside.\n\nWeather: Cloudy\nThe weather is a bit gloomy today. Stay cozy.\n\nWeather: Snowy\nWinter is here! Wrap up warm and enjoy the snow.\n\nWeather: Windy\nHold onto your hat! It's a windy day today.\n\nWeather: Foggy\nBe careful on the roads. The fog is reducing visibility.\n```",
