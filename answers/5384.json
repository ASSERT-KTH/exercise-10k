  "answer": "### Palindrome Checker Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following function checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum()).lower()  # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\n    return s == s[::-1]  # Compare the string with its reverse\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_palindrome(\"radar\"))  # True\n    print(is_palindrome(\"hello\"))  # False\n    print(is_palindrome(\"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\"))  # True\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_palindrome` takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value.\n2. It first removes non-alphanumeric characters from the string and converts it to lowercase to handle case-insensitive palindrome checks.\n3. It then compares the resulting string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).\n4. If the string is equal to its reverse, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote: This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it uses slicing to reverse the string. For very large strings, a more efficient approach might be to use a two-pointer technique to compare characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center.",
