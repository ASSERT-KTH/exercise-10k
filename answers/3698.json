Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted (e.g., `50000`).\n3. Enter the tax rate as a percentage when prompted (e.g., `25` for 25%).\n4. The program will calculate and print the tax amount.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple tax calculation where the tax rate is applied directly to the income.\n* The tax rate is converted from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n* The result is printed with two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
