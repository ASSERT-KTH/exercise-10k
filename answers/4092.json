  "answer": "### Sum of Squares of Even Numbers\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` from the `functools` module to calculate the sum of squares of even numbers in a list.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter even numbers from the list\n    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n    \n    # Square each even number\n    squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, even_numbers))\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of squares using reduce\n    sum_of_squares = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, squares, 0)\n    \n    return sum_of_squares\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of even numbers:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Filtering even numbers**: We use the `filter` function with a lambda function that checks if a number is even (`x % 2 == 0`).\n2. **Squaring even numbers**: We use the `map` function with a lambda function that squares each number (`x ** 2`).\n3. **Calculating the sum**: We use the `reduce` function with a lambda function that adds two numbers (`x + y`). The `reduce` function applies this lambda function to the first two items in the list, then to the result and the next item, and so on, until it has processed all items.\n\n### Alternative Solution Using a Single Line\n\nIf you prefer a more concise solution, you can use the following one-liner:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, map(lambda x: x ** 2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)), 0)\n```\n\nThis solution achieves the same result as the previous one, but in a single line of code.",
