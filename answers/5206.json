Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted (e.g., 50000).\n3. Enter the tax rate as a percentage when prompted (e.g., 25).\n4. The program will calculate and display the tax amount, net income, and other relevant information.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple tax calculation where the tax rate is applied uniformly to the entire income.\n* In reality, tax calculations can be more complex, involving multiple tax brackets, deductions, and exemptions. This program is intended for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual tax calculations.",
