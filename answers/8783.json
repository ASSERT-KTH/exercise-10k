  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the division with remainder:\n\n```python\ndef divide_with_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide the dividend by the divisor and return the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the dividend and divisor from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Perform the division and get the result\n    quotient, remainder = divide_with_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_with_remainder` that takes two numbers as input, `dividend` and `divisor`, and returns the quotient and remainder.\n\n*   It first checks if the divisor is zero, and if so, raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   It then calculates the quotient using the `//` operator, which performs floor division, and the remainder using the `%` operator.\n*   The `main` function gets the dividend and divisor from the user, calls `divide_with_remainder`, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user inputs `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output `17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2`.\n*   If the user inputs `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor, the program will output `10 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0`.",
