  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    mode = statistics.mode(numbers)\n    \n    return {\n        \"mean\": mean,\n        \"median\": median,\n        \"mode\": mode\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [int(x) for x in input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \").split()]\n    stats = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n    \n    print(\"Statistics:\")\n    print(f\"Mean: {stats['mean']}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {stats['median']}\")\n    print(f\"Mode: {stats['mode']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode.\n2. The `statistics.mean` function is used to calculate the mean of the list.\n3. The `statistics.median` function is used to calculate the median of the list.\n4. The `statistics.mode` function is used to calculate the mode of the list.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n6. The input numbers are converted to integers and passed to the `calculate_statistics` function.\n7. The calculated statistics are then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 2 3 4 4 4\nStatistics:\nMean: 2.857142857142857\nMedian: 3\nMode: 4\n```\n\nNote: This program uses the `statistics` module, which is part of the Python Standard Library. If there are multiple modes in the list, this program will raise a `StatisticsError`. If you want to handle multiple modes, you can use the `statistics.multimode` function instead.",
