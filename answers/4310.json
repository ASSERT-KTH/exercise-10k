  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following is an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check for negative numbers\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `factorial` function with an example. We also handle the potential `ValueError` that may be raised for negative inputs.",
