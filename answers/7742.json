  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades. The program should then calculate the average grade of all students and print out the student with the highest grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest grade, print out all of them.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution to the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_and_highest_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of all students and print out the student(s) with the highest grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the dictionary is empty\n    if not grades_dict:\n        print(\"No students in the dictionary.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = sum(grades_dict.values()) / len(grades_dict)\n\n    # Find the highest grade\n    highest_grade = max(grades_dict.values())\n\n    # Find all students with the highest grade\n    highest_graders = [name for name, grade in grades_dict.items() if grade == highest_grade]\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n    if len(highest_graders) == 1:\n        print(f\"The student with the highest grade is {highest_graders[0]} with a grade of {highest_grade}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The students with the highest grade are {', '.join(highest_graders)} with a grade of {highest_grade}.\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades_dict = {\n    \"John\": 85,\n    \"Alice\": 90,\n    \"Bob\": 80,\n    \"Charlie\": 90,\n    \"David\": 75\n}\n\ncalculate_average_and_highest_grades(grades_dict)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The function `calculate_average_and_highest_grades` takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding grades.\n*   It calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of students.\n*   It finds the highest grade using the built-in `max` function.\n*   It finds all students with the highest grade using a list comprehension.\n*   Finally, it prints out the average grade and the student(s) with the highest grade.\n\n**Note:** The grades are assumed to be numeric values. If the grades are stored as strings (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), you would need to modify the code accordingly to handle the conversion between grade strings and their corresponding numeric values.",
