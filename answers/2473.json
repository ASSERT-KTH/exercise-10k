Remove any non-digit characters from the card number.\n2. Check if the card number has between 13 and 16 digits (inclusive).\n3. Apply the Luhn algorithm:\n   * Iterate over the digits in reverse order.\n   * For every second digit, multiply by 2 and subtract 9 if the result is greater than 9.\n   * Add the modified digits to a running sum.\n4. Check if the sum is divisible by 10. If it is, the credit card number is valid.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This function only checks if the credit card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm and does not verify if the card actually exists or has sufficient funds.\n* The Luhn algorithm is not foolproof and can be bypassed with malicious intent.\n* For real-world applications, consider using a more secure and reliable method, such as verifying the card with the issuing bank or using a payment gateway.",
