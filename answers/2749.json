  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates an object's speed given its distance and time. The formula used to calculate speed is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates an object's speed given its distance and time.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object.\n        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed of the object.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled (in meters): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken (in seconds): \"))\n\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed of the object is {speed} meters per second.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_speed` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `time`.\n2. It checks if `time` is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. If `time` is not zero, it calculates the speed using the formula `distance / time`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the distance and time.\n5. It calls the `calculate_speed` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n6. If a `ValueError` occurs (i.e., `time` is zero), it prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `speed_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python speed_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to input the distance and time, and the program will display the calculated speed. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the distance traveled (in meters): 100\nEnter the time taken (in seconds): 10\nThe speed of the object is 10.0 meters per second.\n```",
