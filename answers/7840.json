  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if the input is 'hello', the function should return 'olleh'. The function should be case-sensitive and should not remove any characters from the input string.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string, addressing your requirements for case sensitivity and preserving all characters. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.\n    \n    The function is case-sensitive and does not remove any characters from the input string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The reversed string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is indeed a string. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(input_str, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n    \n    # We use Python's slicing feature to reverse the string. The syntax [::-1] means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1.\n    # This effectively reverses the string.\n    reversed_str = input_str[::-1]\n    \n    # Finally, we return the reversed string.\n    return reversed_str\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(reverse_string('hello'))  # Output: 'olleh'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `reverse_string` first checks if the input `input_str` is indeed a string using `isinstance(input_str, str)`. If not, it raises a TypeError to ensure the function works with the correct data type.\n* It utilizes Python's slicing feature `input_str[::-1]` to reverse the string. This syntax tells Python to start at the end of the string and move backwards to the beginning, effectively reversing the order of characters.\n* The reversed string is then stored in the variable `reversed_str` and returned as the result of the function.\n* An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to reverse the string 'hello' and print the result, which is 'olleh'.",
