  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting with their name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Ask the user for their age\nage = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n# Print out a greeting with their name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n```\n\nThis program first asks the user for their name and stores it in the `name` variable. Then, it asks the user for their age and stores it in the `age` variable. Finally, it prints out a greeting that includes the user's name and age.\n\nNote: The `input` function returns a string, so the age will be stored as a string, not an integer. If you need to perform calculations with the age, you would need to convert it to an integer using `int(age)`.\n\nHere's a slightly more complex version that handles potential errors:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    # Ask the user for their name\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n    # Ask the user for their age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid age. Please try again.\")\n\n    # Print out a greeting with their name and age\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\nget_user_info()\n```\n\nThis version uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for their age until they enter a valid integer. It also uses a `try`/`except` block to catch the `ValueError` that is raised when the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer.",
