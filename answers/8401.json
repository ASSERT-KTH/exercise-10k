  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade for each student from a given dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades. This function will return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their average grades.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Check if the student has any grades\n        if len(grades) > 0:\n            # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student\n            total_grade = sum(grades)\n            \n            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of grades\n            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n            \n            # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n            average_grades[student] = average_grade\n        else:\n            # If the student has no grades, store a grade of 0 in the average_grades dictionary\n            average_grades[student] = 0\n\n    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades for each student\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"Alice\": [90, 85, 95],\n    \"Bob\": [80, 75, 85],\n    \"Charlie\": []\n}\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average_grades` takes a dictionary `grades_dict` where keys are student names and values are lists of grades. It initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n* It iterates over each student in the input dictionary, checks if the student has any grades, and calculates the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n* The average grade is then stored in the `average_grades` dictionary with the student name as the key. If a student has no grades, it stores a grade of 0 in the `average_grades` dictionary.\n* Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary containing the average grades for each student.",
