  "answer": "**Unique Elements in Two Lists**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that finds the unique elements in two lists, i.e., elements that are in either list but not both.\n\n```python\ndef unique_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a set of unique elements in two lists, i.e., elements that are in either list but not both.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first list.\n    list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    set: A set of unique elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    return (set1 - set2) | (set2 - set1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    unique = unique_elements(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Unique elements:\", unique)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `unique_elements` function takes two lists as input.\n2. It converts the lists to sets, which automatically removes duplicates.\n3. It uses the set difference operation (`-`) to find elements that are in `set1` but not `set2`, and vice versa.\n4. It uses the set union operation (`|`) to combine the two sets of unique elements.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `unique_elements` with two example lists.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n```\nUnique elements: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n```\nThis shows that the unique elements in the two lists are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8, which are in either list but not both.",
