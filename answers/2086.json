  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of a set of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the sum of squares of a set of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of a set of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([n ** 2 for n in numbers])\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = sum_of_squares(numbers)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares of {numbers} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `sum_of_squares` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to calculate the square of each number in the list.\n3. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of these squared numbers.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n5. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `sum_of_squares` function.\n\n### Example output:\n```\nThe sum of squares of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is: 55\n```\n\nThis program uses a concise and efficient approach to calculate the sum of squares, making it suitable for large sets of numbers.",
