  "answer": "### Shortest Word in a Sentence\n\nTo find the shortest word in a sentence, we will:\n\n1. Read a sentence from the user.\n2. Split the sentence into words.\n3. Find the shortest word.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_shortest_word(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the shortest word in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The shortest word in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    sentence = ''.join(e for e in sentence if e.isalnum() or e.isspace()).lower()\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Find the shortest word\n    shortest_word = min(words, key=len)\n    \n    return shortest_word\n\n# Read a sentence from the user\nsentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n\n# Find and print the shortest word\nshortest_word = find_shortest_word(sentence)\nprint(\"The shortest word is:\", shortest_word)\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n  Output: \"the\"\n* Input: \"Hello world\"\n  Output: \"world\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `find_shortest_word` function takes a sentence as input.\n2. It removes punctuation and converts the sentence to lowercase.\n3. It splits the sentence into words using the `split` method.\n4. It finds the shortest word using the `min` function with the `key` argument set to `len`.\n5. The shortest word is returned and printed.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input sentence only contains spaces as word separators. If you need to handle other types of word separators (e.g., tabs, newlines), you may need to modify the solution accordingly.",
