  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their greatest common divisor.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple implementation of a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n```\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"The GCD of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", gcd(num1, num2))\n```\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCD of `a` and `b` is equal to the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n3. The loop continues until `b` is 0, at which point `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n4. The program then prompts the user to enter two numbers, and prints the GCD of the two numbers using the `gcd` function.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g. `gcd.py`) and run it from the command line using `python gcd.py`. Then, simply follow the prompts to enter two numbers and see their GCD.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you want to handle floating-point numbers or other types of input, you may need to modify the program accordingly.",
