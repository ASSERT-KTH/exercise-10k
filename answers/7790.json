  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input and then prints out a greeting message with their name and a message stating whether they are eligible to vote or not based on their age. Assume the voting age is 18.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets your requirements:\n```\n# Get user's name and age\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# Check if user is eligible to vote\nif age >= 18:\n    print(f\"{name}, you are eligible to vote.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{name}, you are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\")\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The program first asks the user to enter their name and age using the `input()` function.\n2. The `input()` function returns a string, so we use `int()` to convert the age to an integer.\n3. The program then prints a greeting message using an f-string, which allows us to insert the user's name into the string.\n4. The program checks if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 using an `if` statement.\n5. If the user is eligible to vote, the program prints a message stating so. Otherwise, it prints a message stating that they are not eligible and must be at least 18 years old.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* If the user enters \"John\" as their name and \"25\" as their age, the program will print:\n```\nHello, John!\nJohn, you are eligible to vote.\n```\n* If the user enters \"Jane\" as their name and \"16\" as their age, the program will print:\n```\nHello, Jane!\nJane, you are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\n```",
