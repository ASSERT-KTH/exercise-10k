  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 matrix of numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define the size of the matrix\nmatrix_size = 5\n\n# Initialize a counter for the numbers\nnum = 1\n\n# Use nested for loops to print the matrix\nfor i in range(matrix_size):\n    for j in range(matrix_size):\n        print(f\"{num:2d}\", end=\" \")\n        num += 1\n    print()\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1.  It defines the size of the matrix using the `matrix_size` variable.\n2.  It initializes a counter `num` to 1, which will be used to print the numbers in the matrix.\n3.  The outer for loop (`for i in range(matrix_size)`) iterates over the rows of the matrix.\n4.  The inner for loop (`for j in range(matrix_size)`) iterates over the columns of the matrix.\n5.  Inside the inner loop, it prints the current value of `num` using the `print` function with the `end=\" \"` argument to separate the numbers with a space.\n6.  After printing each number, it increments `num` by 1 using `num += 1`.\n7.  Once the inner loop completes (i.e., all columns of a row have been printed), it prints a newline character using `print()` to move to the next row.\n\nHere's an example output of this program:\n\n```\n 1  2  3  4  5 \n 6  7  8  9 10 \n11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 \n21 22 23 24 25 \n```\n\nYou can adjust the value of `matrix_size` to create matrices of different sizes.",
