  "answer": "**First Non-Repeated Character in a String**\n=============================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string. It then iterates over the string to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeated_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The first non-repeated character if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_frequency = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_frequency:\n            char_frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_frequency[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeated character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_frequency[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeated character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"hello\"\n    result = first_non_repeated_char(s)\n    if result:\n        print(f\"The first non-repeated character in '{s}' is '{result}'\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No non-repeated character found in '{s}'\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. Create a dictionary `char_frequency` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string to populate the `char_frequency` dictionary.\n3. Iterate over the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n4. If a non-repeated character is found, return it. Otherwise, return None.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate over the string twice: once to populate the `char_frequency` dictionary and once to find the first non-repeated character.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n--------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character, which can contain up to n entries in the worst case.",
