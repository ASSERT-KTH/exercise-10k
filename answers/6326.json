  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list, an element, and an index as input, inserts the element at the specified index, and returns the resulting list.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function that inserts an element at a specified index in a list and returns the resulting list. This function will ensure that the index is valid and handle edge cases accordingly. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef insert_element(lst, element, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts an element at a specified index in a list and returns the resulting list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        element: The element to be inserted.\n        index (int): The index at which the element is to be inserted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The resulting list after insertion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the index is within the bounds of the list\n    if index < 0 or index > len(lst):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n    # Create a copy of the original list to avoid modifying it directly\n    new_lst = lst.copy()\n\n    # Use list slicing to split the list into two parts at the specified index\n    # The part before the index will be the first slice, and the part after the index will be the second slice\n    first_part = new_lst[:index]\n    second_part = new_lst[index:]\n\n    # Combine the first slice, the element to be inserted, and the second slice to form the new list\n    new_lst = first_part + [element] + second_part\n\n    # Return the new list\n    return new_lst\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `insert_element` first checks if the provided `index` is within the valid range of the input list `lst`. If the index is out of range, it raises an `IndexError`.\n* To avoid modifying the original list, a copy of `lst` is created using the `copy()` method and stored in `new_lst`.\n* The function then uses list slicing to split `new_lst` into two parts at the specified `index`: `first_part` and `second_part`.\n* Finally, it combines `first_part`, the `element` to be inserted, and `second_part` to form the new list, which is then returned as the result.",
