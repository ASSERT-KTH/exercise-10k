  "answer": "Here's a Python program that filters a list of numbers and returns only the numbers that meet a specified condition. In this example, we'll filter out even numbers.\n\n```python\ndef filter_numbers(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of numbers based on a specified condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to filter.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns True if the number meets the condition, False otherwise.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers that meet the specified condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if condition(num)]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_condition = lambda x: x % 2 == 0\nodd_condition = lambda x: x % 2 != 0\n\neven_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, even_condition)\nodd_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, odd_condition)\n\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `filter_numbers` function takes a list of numbers and a condition function as arguments.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to filter the numbers based on the condition.\n*   The `even_condition` and `odd_condition` are lambda functions that define the conditions for even and odd numbers, respectively.\n*   In the example usage, we filter the `numbers` list using both conditions and print the results.\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and flexible way to filter a list of numbers based on a specified condition. You can replace the `even_condition` and `odd_condition` with any other condition function to filter the numbers according to your needs.",
