  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their least common multiple.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\n# Get the two numbers as input from the user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the LCM\nlcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The least common multiple of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", lcm)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Import the `math` module, which provides the `gcd` function for calculating the greatest common divisor.\n2. Define a function `calculate_lcm` that takes two numbers `num1` and `num2` as input.\n3. Calculate the GCD of `num1` and `num2` using `math.gcd`.\n4. Calculate the LCM using the formula `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n5. Get the two numbers as input from the user using `input`.\n6. Call the `calculate_lcm` function with the two input numbers and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 15`\nOutput: `The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60`\n* Input: `num1 = 24`, `num2 = 30`\nOutput: `The least common multiple of 24 and 30 is: 120`\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module instead.",
