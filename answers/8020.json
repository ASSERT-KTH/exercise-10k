  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a paragraph of text as input, counts the frequency of each word, and prints the words along with their frequencies in descending order. Ignore case sensitivity, punctuation, and consider 'word' and 'words' as different words.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses regular expressions to remove punctuation and the `collections` module to count word frequencies:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_word_frequencies(paragraph):\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lower case\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', paragraph.lower())\n    \n    # Count word frequencies\n    word_freq = Counter(words)\n    \n    # Print words and their frequencies in descending order\n    for word, freq in word_freq.most_common():\n        print(f\"{word}: {freq}\")\n\n# Test the function\nparagraph = \"This is a test paragraph. It contains multiple sentences, and some of them are quite long. This is just a test.\"\ncount_word_frequencies(paragraph)\n```\n\nHowever, the above solution converts the entire paragraph to lower case which may not be desirable if you want to preserve the original case of the words. Here's a modified version of the solution that ignores case sensitivity when counting word frequencies but preserves the original case of the words:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_word_frequencies(paragraph):\n    # Remove punctuation\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', paragraph)\n    \n    # Count word frequencies, ignoring case sensitivity\n    word_freq = Counter(word.lower() for word in words)\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the original case of each word\n    original_case = {}\n    for word in words:\n        if word.lower() not in original_case:\n            original_case[word.lower()] = word\n    \n    # Print words and their frequencies in descending order\n    for word, freq in word_freq.most_common():\n        print(f\"{original_case[word]}: {freq}\")\n\n# Test the function\nparagraph = \"This is a test paragraph. It contains multiple sentences, and some of them are quite long. This is just a test.\"\ncount_word_frequencies(paragraph)\n```\n\nIn this modified version, we use a dictionary `original_case` to store the original case of each word. We then use this dictionary to print the words in their original case.",
