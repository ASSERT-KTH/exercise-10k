  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a simple phonebook:\n\n```python\nclass PhoneBook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.phonebook = {}\n\n    def add_contact(self, name, phone_number):\n        \"\"\"Add a new contact to the phonebook\"\"\"\n        self.phonebook[name] = phone_number\n        print(f\"Contact {name} added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_contact(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Remove a contact from the phonebook\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phonebook:\n            del self.phonebook[name]\n            print(f\"Contact {name} removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Contact {name} not found in the phonebook.\")\n\n    def search_contact(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Search for a contact in the phonebook\"\"\"\n        if name in self.phonebook:\n            print(f\"Phone number of {name}: {self.phonebook[name]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Contact {name} not found in the phonebook.\")\n\n    def display_phonebook(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all contacts in the phonebook\"\"\"\n        if not self.phonebook:\n            print(\"Phonebook is empty.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Phonebook:\")\n            for name, phone_number in self.phonebook.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {phone_number}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    phonebook = PhoneBook()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPhonebook Menu:\")\n        print(\"1.

Run the program and select option 1 to add a contact.\n2.  Enter the contact name and phone number when prompted.\n3.  Select option 3 to search for the contact you just added.\n4.  Enter the contact name when prompted to see the corresponding phone number.\n5.  Select option 4 to display all contacts in the phonebook.\n6.  Select option 2 to remove a contact.\n7.  Enter the contact name when prompted to remove the corresponding entry from the phonebook.\n8.  Select option 5 to quit the program.",
