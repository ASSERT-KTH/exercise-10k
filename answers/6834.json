  "prompt": "Write a program that takes user input for their name, age, and height, and then stores this information in variables of appropriate data types. Finally, print out the user's information in a formatted string.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to take user input and store it in variables, then print out the information in a formatted string:\n\n```python\n# Take user input for name, age, and height\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\nheight = float(input(\"Please enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n# Print out the user's information in a formatted string\nprint(f\"Your name is {name}, you are {age} years old, and your height is {height} meters.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Function**: We use the built-in `input()` function to get user input.\n2. **Data Type Conversion**: We convert the user's age to an integer using `int()` and the height to a floating-point number using `float()`. This is because `input()` always returns a string.\n3. **Formatted String**: We use an f-string to create a formatted string with the user's information. The `f` prefix before the string denotes an f-string. We can embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- You can use this program as a starting point to collect user information for any application that requires user data.\n- You can modify the program to collect additional user information, such as address, phone number, or email.\n- You can also use this program as a template to create more complex user interfaces, such as a registration form or a survey.\n\n### Advice\n- Always validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and range.\n- Consider using a loop to repeatedly ask for input until valid input is provided.\n- Use meaningful variable names to improve code readability and maintainability.",
