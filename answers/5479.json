  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a function as input and groups the elements of the list by the result of applying the function to each element.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfrom itertools import groupby\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\n# Test the group_by function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ngroups = group_by(numbers, lambda x: x % 2)\n\nfor group in groups:\n    print(list(group))\n```\nI've implemented the `group_by` function using the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module, as specified. The `groupby` function groups the elements of the input list based on the result of applying the `key_fn` function to each element. The `itemgetter` function is used to extract the key from each element, which in this case is the result of applying the `key_fn` function.\n\nThe test code at the end creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, groups them by their remainder when divided by 2, and prints each group as a list.\n\nHere is the full code with the `group_by` function definition:\n```\nfrom itertools import groupby\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\ndef group_by(input_list, key_fn):\n    return groupby(sorted(input_list, key=key_fn), key=key_fn)\n\n# Test the group_by function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ngroups = group_by(numbers, lambda x: x % 2)\n\nfor group in groups:\n    print(list(group))\n```\nThis code defines the `group_by` function and uses it to group the numbers by their remainder when divided by 2, printing each group as a list.",
