  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in three subjects. The program should use functions to calculate the average score and determine the grade. The grade should be determined as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the average score\ndef calculate_average(score1, score2, score3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of three scores.\n\n    Args:\n        score1 (float): Score of the first subject.\n        score2 (float): Score of the second subject.\n        score3 (float): Score of the third subject.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average score.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3\n\n\n# Function to determine the grade\ndef determine_grade(average_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the grade based on the average score.\n\n    Args:\n        average_score (float): The average score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if 90 <= average_score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    elif 80 <= average_score < 90:\n        return 'B'\n    elif 70 <= average_score < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    elif 60 <= average_score < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Input scores of the three subjects\n    score1 = float(input(\"Enter the score of the first subject: \"))\n    score2 = float(input(\"Enter the score of the second subject: \"))\n    score3 = float(input(\"Enter the score of the third subject: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the average score\n    average_score = calculate_average(score1, score2, score3)\n\n    # Determine the grade\n    grade = determine_grade(average_score)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Average Score: {average_score:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines three functions:\n\n1.  `calculate_average(score1, score2, score3)`: This function calculates the average of three scores.\n2.  `determine_grade(average_score)`: This function determines the grade based on the average score.\n3.  `main()`: This is the main function where the program starts execution. It takes the scores of three subjects as input from the user, calculates the average score, determines the grade, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the scores of the three subjects when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the score of the first subject: 85\nEnter the score of the second subject: 90\nEnter the score of the third subject: 78\nAverage Score: 84.33\nGrade: B\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how the program calculates the average score and determines the grade based on the input scores.",
