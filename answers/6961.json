  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an email address as an argument and returns True if it is valid (contains '@') and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function to validate an email address based on the presence of a specific character. This function will take an email address as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the email address is valid or not. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if an email address is valid by checking if it contains '@'.\n\n    Args:\n        email (str): The email address to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the email address is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a string. If it's not, we immediately return False.\n    if not isinstance(email, str):\n        return False\n    \n    # Now, we'll check if the email contains '@'. We can use the 'in' operator in Python for this.\n    # The 'in' operator checks if a substring is present in a string and returns True if it is, False otherwise.\n    return '@' in email\n\n# Test the function\nprint(is_valid_email(\"test@example.com\"))  # Should return True\nprint(is_valid_email(\"invalid_email\"))  # Should return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_valid_email` checks if the input `email` is a string using `isinstance(email, str)`. If it's not a string, the function immediately returns `False`.\n* The function uses the `in` operator to check if the `email` contains the character `'@'`. This operator returns `True` if the character is found and `False` otherwise.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of its purpose, arguments, and return values. This makes it easier for users to understand how to use the function.\n* Example use cases are provided to demonstrate how to use the `is_valid_email` function with different email addresses.",
