  "answer": "**Most Frequent Character Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the most frequent character in a given string. It ignores case and non-alphanumeric characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef most_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most frequent character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The most frequent character.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lower case\n    cleaned_s = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s).lower()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_count = Counter(cleaned_s)\n    \n    # Find the most common character\n    most_common_char = char_count.most_common(1)\n    \n    # Return the most frequent character\n    if most_common_char:\n        return most_common_char[0][0]\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(most_frequent_char(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function first removes non-alphanumeric characters from the string using a regular expression.\n2. It then converts the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity.\n3. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character.\n4. The `most_common` method of the `Counter` object returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a character and its frequency.\n5. The function returns the most frequent character. If the input string is empty or contains no alphanumeric characters, it returns `None`.\n\n### Note\n\nIf there are multiple characters with the same highest frequency, this function will return one of them. If you want to return all characters with the highest frequency, you can modify the function to return a list of characters.",
