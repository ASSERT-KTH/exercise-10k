  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using variables and conditional statements in Python.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n------------------------\n\n1.  The `game` function contains a while loop that continues to run until the user decides to stop playing.\n2.  Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.\n3.  The input is validated to ensure it's one of the allowed choices.\n4.  The computer's choice is randomly selected from the list of possible choices.\n5.  The user's choice and the computer's choice are printed to the console.\n6.  The code then uses conditional statements to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n7.  After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. If they choose to stop playing, the loop breaks, and the game ends.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Run the code and enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.\n*   The computer will generate its choice and display both choices.\n*   The code will then determine the winner based on the game's rules and print the result.\n*   You can choose to play again or stop the game.",
