  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the result of a custom reduction operation, such as finding the maximum or minimum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef reduction(arr):\n    ans = float('inf')\n    for i in arr:\n        if i < ans:\n            ans = i\n    return ans\n\nA = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nprint(reduction(A))\n```\nThis code defines the `reduction` function, which takes an array `arr` as input and returns the smallest element in the array. The function uses a variable `ans` to store the current smallest element, initializing it to positive infinity. It then iterates over each element `i` in the array, updating `ans` if `i` is smaller. Finally, it returns the smallest element found, which is stored in `ans`.\n\nThe code then defines an array `A` containing the integers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50, and calls the `reduction` function on this array, printing the result to the console. The output should be the smallest element in the array, which is 10.",
