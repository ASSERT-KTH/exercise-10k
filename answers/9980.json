  "answer": "Immutable Variables Program\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that demonstrates the concept of immutable variables.\n\n```python\n# Immutable Variables Program\n\n# Immutable Variables\n# ------------------\n\n# In Python, the following data types are immutable:\n# - Integers\n# - Floats\n# - Complex numbers\n# - Strings\n# - Tuples\n\n# Example Usage\n# -------------\n\ndef main():\n    # Immutable integer\n    immutable_int = 10\n    print(\"Immutable Integer:\", immutable_int)\n\n    # Trying to change the immutable integer\n    # This will not change the original integer, but create a new one\n    immutable_int += 1\n    print(\"Immutable Integer after change:\", immutable_int)\n\n    # Immutable string\n    immutable_str = \"Hello\"\n    print(\"Immutable String:\", immutable_str)\n\n    # Trying to change the immutable string\n    # This will not change the original string, but create a new one\n    immutable_str += \" World\"\n    print(\"Immutable String after change:\", immutable_str)\n\n    # Immutable tuple\n    immutable_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n    print(\"Immutable Tuple:\", immutable_tuple)\n\n    # Trying to change the immutable tuple\n    # This will raise an error\n    try:\n        immutable_tuple[0] = 10\n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExplanation\n------------\n\nIn this program, we demonstrate the concept of immutable variables using integers, strings, and tuples. We show that even though we try to change these variables, they remain unchanged. Instead, new objects are created when we try to modify them.\n\nWhen we try to change the immutable tuple, a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the operation is not allowed.\n\nRunning this program will output:\n\n```\nImmutable Integer: 10\nImmutable Integer after change: 11\nImmutable String: Hello\nImmutable String after change: Hello World\nImmutable Tuple: (1, 2, 3)\nError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n\nNote that while the values of immutable variables cannot be changed, the variables themselves can be reassigned to new values.",
