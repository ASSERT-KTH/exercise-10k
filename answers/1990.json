  "answer": "**Game Score Tracker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows users to track game scores and determines the winner based on the scores. The program uses conditional statements to compare the scores and declare the winner.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef game_score_tracker():\n    \"\"\"\n    Tracks game scores and determines the winner.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize team names and scores\n    team1_name = input(\"Enter Team 1 name: \")\n    team2_name = input(\"Enter Team 2 name: \")\n\n    team1_score = int(input(f\"Enter {team1_name} score: \"))\n    team2_score = int(input(f\"Enter {team2_name} score: \"))\n\n    # Determine the winner using conditional statements\n    if team1_score > team2_score:\n        winner = team1_name\n    elif team2_score > team1_score:\n        winner = team2_name\n    else:\n        winner = \"It's a tie!\"\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"\\nGame Results:\")\n    print(f\"{team1_name} score: {team1_score}\")\n    print(f\"{team2_name} score: {team2_score}\")\n    print(f\"The winner is: {winner}\")\n\ndef main():\n    game_score_tracker()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the team names when prompted.\n2. Enter the scores for each team.\n3. The program will determine the winner based on the scores and print the results.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nEnter Team 1 name: Team A\nEnter Team 2 name: Team B\nEnter Team A score: 10\nEnter Team B score: 5\n\nGame Results:\nTeam A score: 10\nTeam B score: 5\nThe winner is: Team A\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program initializes team names and scores using user input.\n2. The `if-elif-else` statement compares the scores and determines the winner.\n\t* If Team 1's score is higher, Team 1 is declared the winner.\n\t* If Team 2's score is higher, Team 2 is declared the winner.\n\t* If the scores are tied, the program declares a tie.\n3. The program prints the game results, including the scores and the winner.",
