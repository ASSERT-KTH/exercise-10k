  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the side length of a cube as input and prints its volume.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The side length of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the side length from the user\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the volume\n    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function `calculate_cube_volume`**: This function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length (`side_length ** 3`).\n2. **Function `main`**: This function gets the side length from the user, calculates the volume using the `calculate_cube_volume` function, and prints the result.\n3. **Input/Output**: The program prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube, calculates the volume, and then prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the side length of the cube when prompted. For example, if you enter `5`, the program will output `The volume of the cube is: 125.00 cubic units`.",
