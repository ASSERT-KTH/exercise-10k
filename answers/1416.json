  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores. If the score is above 90, print 'A', between 80 and 90 print 'B', and so on.",
  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their scores. The grades are assigned as follows:\n- A: 90-100\n- B: 80-89\n- C: 70-79\n- D: 60-69\n- F: Below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]\n    for score in scores:\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function with a list of example scores.\n3. The program uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nScore: 95, Grade: A\nScore: 85, Grade: B\nScore: 75, Grade: C\nScore: 65, Grade: D\nScore: 55, Grade: F\n```",
