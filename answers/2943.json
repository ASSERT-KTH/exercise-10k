  "answer": "**Binary Search Algorithm Implementation**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array. The binary search algorithm is an efficient searching algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a target value in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of integers.\n        target (int): The target value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target value if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target value {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target value {target} not found in the array.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `binary_search` function takes a sorted array `arr` and a target value `target` as input.\n2.  It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n3.  The function enters a while loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right`.\n4.  Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` using the formula `(left + right) // 2`.\n5.  It compares the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target value.\n    *   If they are equal, the function returns the middle index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, the function moves the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, the function moves the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n6.  If the loop ends without finding the target, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target is not in the array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case time complexity: O(1)\n*   Average-case time complexity: O(log n)\n*   Worst-case time complexity: O(log n)\n\nNote that the binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) because it divides the search space in half at each step, leading to logarithmic time complexity.",
