  "answer": "**Student Status Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines a student's status based on their grade. The status is categorized as follows:\n\n* Honors: 90 or above\n* Good standing: 80-89\n* Probation: 70-79\n* Failed: below 70\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef determine_student_status(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine a student's status based on their grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (float): The student's grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's status.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade >= 90:\n        return \"Honors\"\n    elif 80 <= grade < 90:\n        return \"Good standing\"\n    elif 70 <= grade < 80:\n        return \"Probation\"\n    else:\n        return \"Failed\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's grade: \"))\n    status = determine_student_status(grade)\n    print(f\"The student's status is: {status}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `determine_student_status` function takes a grade as input and returns the corresponding status.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a grade, determines the status using the `determine_student_status` function, and prints the result.\n3. The program uses if-elif-else statements to determine the status based on the grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a grade of 95: The student's status is: Honors\n* Enter a grade of 85: The student's status is: Good standing\n* Enter a grade of 75: The student's status is: Probation\n* Enter a grade of 60: The student's status is: Failed",
