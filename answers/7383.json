  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the program should print the new balance after the withdrawal. Use conditional statements (if/else) to achieve this.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a bank transaction system:\n```python\ndef simulate_bank_transaction():\n    # Ask for the user's current balance\n    current_balance = float(input(\"Enter your current balance: \"))\n\n    # Ask for the withdrawal amount\n    withdrawal_amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount you want to withdraw: \"))\n\n    # Check if the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance\n    if withdrawal_amount > current_balance:\n        print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate the new balance\n        new_balance = current_balance - withdrawal_amount\n        print(f\"Withdrawal successful. Your new balance is ${new_balance:.2f}\")\n\n# Call the function to start the simulation\nsimulate_bank_transaction()\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The program defines a function `simulate_bank_transaction()` that contains the bank transaction simulation logic.\n2. The function asks the user for their current balance using the `input()` function and converts the input to a floating-point number using `float()`.\n3. The function then asks the user for the withdrawal amount and converts the input to a floating-point number using `float()`.\n4. The program uses an `if` statement to check if the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance. If it is, the program prints \"Insufficient funds\".\n5. If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the program calculates the new balance by subtracting the withdrawal amount from the current balance.\n6. The program prints the new balance using an f-string, which allows for formatting the output as a string with two decimal places using `:.2f`.\n7. Finally, the program calls the `simulate_bank_transaction()` function to start the simulation.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* If the user enters a current balance of $100 and a withdrawal amount of $50, the program will print \"Withdrawal successful. Your new balance is $50.00\".\n* If the user enters a current balance of $100 and a withdrawal amount of $150, the program will print \"Insufficient funds\".",
