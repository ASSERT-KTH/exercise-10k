  "prompt": "Create a program that determines the number of days in a given month, using conditional statements to account for leap years and month lengths",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to calculate the number of days in a given month and year, considering leap years and varying month lengths:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a year is a leap year.\n    \n    Args:\n    year (int): The year to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef days_in_month(month, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of days in a given month and year.\n    \n    Args:\n    month (int): The month (1-12) to calculate days for.\n    year (int): The year to consider for leap year checks.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of days in the given month and year.\n    \"\"\"\n    if month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:  # Months with 31 days\n        return 31\n    elif month == 2:  # February\n        if is_leap_year(year):\n            return 29  # Leap year, February has 29 days\n        else:\n            return 28  # Not a leap year, February has 28 days\n    else:  # Months with 30 days\n        return 30\n\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    \n    if 1 <= month <= 12:\n        days = days_in_month(month, year)\n        print(f\"There are {days} days in month {month} of the year {year}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid month. Please enter a number between 1 and 12.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Leap Year Check**: The `is_leap_year` function checks if a year is a leap year by following the standard rules:\n   - The year can be evenly divided by 4;\n   - If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;\n   - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n\n2. **Days in Month Calculation**: The `days_in_month` function calculates the number of days in a month based on the month number and whether the year is a leap year.\n\n3. **Main Program**: The `main` function prompts the user to input a year and a month, checks if the month is valid (between 1 and 12), and then uses the `days_in_month` function to calculate and print the number of days in the given month and year.\n\nThis program handles all 12 months, including February during leap years, and provides a clear and user-friendly interface for determining the number of days in any given month and year.",
