The program should first ask the user to choose an operation and then input two numbers. It should then perform the chosen operation on the two numbers and display the result.

The `main` function prompts the user to choose an operation and input two numbers. It uses a dictionary to map the user's choice to the corresponding function and then performs the chosen operation on the two numbers. The program includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operation choices.",
