  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all elements in the list.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = calculate_sum(numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of the list is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_sum` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all elements in the list.\n3. The result is returned by the function.\n4. In the example usage, we create a list of numbers, call the `calculate_sum` function with this list, and print the result.\n\nYou can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to calculate the sum for.",
