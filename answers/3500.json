  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the minimum number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the minimum number in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n    return min(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]\n    try:\n        min_number = find_min(numbers)\n        print(f\"The minimum number is: {min_number}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The function `find_min` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. If the list is not empty, it uses the built-in `min` function to find the minimum number in the list.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `find_min`. It creates a list of numbers and calls `find_min` with this list.\n5. If `find_min` raises a `ValueError`, the `main` function catches the exception and prints the error message.\n\n### Notes:\n\n* This program assumes that the input list only contains numbers. If the list can contain other types of data, you may need to add error checking code to handle this.\n* The `min` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that the function becomes slower as the size of the input list increases. However, for most use cases, this should not be a problem.",
