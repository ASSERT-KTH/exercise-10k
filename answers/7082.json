  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n    \n    A year is a leap year if it is perfectly divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. \n    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n    \n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    \n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if the year is a leap year by applying the following rules:\n   - The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n   - If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:\n   - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n\n2. The `main` function reads a year from the user and checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a year. After you enter a year and press Enter, it will print whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n```\nEnter a year: 2020\n2020 is a leap year.\n```",
