  "prompt": "Develop a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe with the user. The program should generate a 3x3 grid, ask for user input, and determine the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python:\n\n```python\n# Tic Tac Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # We will use a single list to represent the 3x3 board\n\ndef print_board():\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef check_win(player):\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] == player:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef check_draw():\n    return ' ' not in board\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        if check_win(current_player):\n            print_board()\n            print(\"Player {} wins! Congratulations!\".format(current_player))\n            break\n        elif check_draw():\n            print_board()\n            print(\"It's a draw!\")\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   We start by initializing an empty board as a list of 9 spaces.\n*   The `print_board` function prints the current state of the board.\n*   The `check_win` function checks if the current player has won by examining all possible winning combinations.\n*   The `check_draw` function checks if the game is a draw by verifying if there are any empty spaces left on the board.\n*   In the `main` function, we enter a loop where we keep asking the current player for their move until the game is over.\n*   We update the board with the player's move and check if the game is over after each move.\n*   If the game is over, we print the final state of the board and announce the winner or a draw.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Run the program and play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by entering your moves when prompted.\n*   Try to win the game by getting three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.\n*   If you want to play again, simply run the program again.",
