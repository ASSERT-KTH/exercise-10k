  "answer": "**Most Frequent Element Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the most frequent element in a given list.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_element(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the most frequent element in the given list.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n    \n    Returns:\n        The most frequent element in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lst:\n        return None\n    \n    counter = Counter(lst)\n    return counter.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprint(most_frequent_element(numbers))  # Output: 4\n\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'apple']\nprint(most_frequent_element(words))  # Output: 'apple'\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the list.\n2. The `Counter` object returns a dictionary-like object where the keys are the elements in the list and the values are their frequencies.\n3. We use the `most_common` method to get the most frequent element. This method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element and its frequency.\n4. We return the first element of the first tuple, which is the most frequent element.\n\n**Note**: If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, this program will return one of them. If you want to return all elements with the highest frequency, you can modify the program to return all elements with the maximum frequency.",
