  "answer": "**GCD Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n*   The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n*   The GCD is then returned as the absolute value of `a`.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `gcd_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python gcd_calculator.py`). The program will output the GCD of the two example numbers. You can modify the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the GCD of different numbers.",
