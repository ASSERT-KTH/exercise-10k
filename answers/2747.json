  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates an employee's salary based on their hourly wage and number of hours worked.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates an employee's salary:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_salary(hourly_wage, hours_worked):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate an employee's salary based on their hourly wage and number of hours worked.\n\n    Args:\n        hourly_wage (float): The employee's hourly wage.\n        hours_worked (float): The number of hours the employee worked.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The employee's salary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return hourly_wage * hours_worked\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Employee Salary Calculator\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------\")\n\n    # Get the hourly wage from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            hourly_wage = float(input(\"Enter the employee's hourly wage: $\"))\n            if hourly_wage < 0:\n                print(\"Hourly wage cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Get the number of hours worked from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            hours_worked = float(input(\"Enter the number of hours the employee worked: \"))\n            if hours_worked < 0:\n                print(\"Hours worked cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and display the employee's salary\n    salary = calculate_salary(hourly_wage, hours_worked)\n    print(f\"The employee's salary is: ${salary:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `calculate_salary` function takes two arguments: `hourly_wage` and `hours_worked`. It returns the employee's salary by multiplying these two values.\n2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It prints a header, then prompts the user to enter the hourly wage and number of hours worked.\n3. The program uses `try`/`except` blocks to validate the user's input. It checks that the input is a non-negative number. If the input is invalid, it prints an error message and prompts the user to try again.\n4. Once the user has entered valid input, the program calculates the employee's salary using the `calculate_salary` function.\n5. Finally, the program prints the employee's salary to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n```\nEmployee Salary Calculator\n-------------------------------\nEnter the employee's hourly wage: $20\nEnter the number of hours the employee worked: 40\nThe employee's salary is: $800.00\n```",
