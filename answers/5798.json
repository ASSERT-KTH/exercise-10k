  "answer": "### Leap Year Checker Function\n#### Description\nThis function checks if a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is perfectly divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.\n    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    years = [1999, 2000, 1900, 2020, 2021]\n    for year in years:\n        print(f\"Is {year} a leap year? {is_leap_year(year)}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check the divisibility of the year by 4, 100, and 400, following the Gregorian calendar rules:\n\n- The year must be divisible by 4.\n- If the year is a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.",
