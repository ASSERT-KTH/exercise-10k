  "prompt": "Write a program that prints out a pattern of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence or a pyramid of numbers.",
  "answer": "**Pyramid of Numbers Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program prints a pyramid of numbers where each row contains one more number than the previous row. The numbers start from 1 and increment by 1.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef print_pyramid(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pyramid of numbers with n rows.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows in the pyramid.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        print(\" \" * (n - i), end=\"\")\n        \n        # Print numbers\n        for _ in range(i):\n            print(f\"{num:2d}\", end=\" \")\n            num += 1\n        \n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    n = 5\n    print(f\"Pyramid of {n} rows:\")\n    print_pyramid(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nPyramid of 5 rows:\n    1 \n   2  3 \n  4  5  6 \n 7  8  9 10 \n11 12 13 14 15 \n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `print_pyramid` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of rows in the pyramid.\n2. The outer loop iterates over each row in the pyramid.\n3. The inner loop prints the numbers for each row. The `num` variable keeps track of the current number to be printed.\n4. The `print` statements use string formatting to align the numbers in columns.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `print_pyramid` function with an example input.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n* To change the starting number, modify the initial value of the `num` variable.\n* To change the increment between numbers, modify the `num += 1` statement.\n* To print a different type of pattern, modify the inner loop to generate the desired sequence of numbers.",
