  "prompt": "Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted list to find a target value using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Binary Search using while loop\n\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Testing the function\narr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]\ntarget = 10\nprint(binary_search(arr, target))  # Output: 3\n```\nThis code defines a function `binary_search` that takes a sorted array `arr` and a target value `target` as input, and returns the index of the target value in the array if it exists. The function uses a while loop to iterate until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.\n\nThe code also includes a testing section that creates a sorted array `arr` and a target value `target`, and calls the `binary_search` function to find the index of the target value in the array. The output of the function is printed to the console.\n\nNote that I've used the formula `mid = left + (right - left) // 2` to calculate the midpoint index, which is a common way to avoid integer overflow when calculating the midpoint of a large array.",
