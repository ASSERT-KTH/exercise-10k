  "answer": "**Finding the Second Smallest Number in a List**\n\nHere is a Python program that finds the second smallest number in a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the second smallest number in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The second smallest number in the list. If the list has less than two unique elements, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove duplicates and sort the list\n    unique_numbers = sorted(set(numbers))\n    \n    # Check if the list has at least two unique elements\n    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:\n        return None\n    \n    # Return the second smallest number\n    return unique_numbers[1]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [5, 2, 8, 12, 3, 2, 5]\nsecond_smallest = find_second_smallest(numbers)\n\nif second_smallest is not None:\n    print(f\"The second smallest number is: {second_smallest}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The list has less than two unique elements.\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `find_second_smallest` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then sorts the resulting set.\n3. It checks if the list has at least two unique elements. If not, it returns `None`.\n4. If the list has at least two unique elements, it returns the second smallest number, which is the second element in the sorted list (`unique_numbers[1]`).\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Finding the second smallest number in a list of exam scores.\n* Identifying the second smallest value in a dataset.\n* Determining the second smallest price in a list of product prices.",
