  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their age and validates that it is a positive integer, displaying an error message if the input is invalid.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_age():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's age and validates that it's a positive integer.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age <= 0:\n                print(\"Error: Age must be a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                return age\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: Age must be a positive integer.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    age = get_age()\n    print(f\"Your age is: {age}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It defines a function called `get_age()` that asks the user for their age.\n2. It uses a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions, which occur when the input cannot be converted to an integer.\n3. It checks if the input age is less than or equal to zero. If it is, it displays an error message and asks for the age again.\n4. If the input age is a positive integer, it returns the age.\n5. The `main()` function calls `get_age()` and prints the user's age.\n\nThis program will continue to ask for the user's age until a valid positive integer is entered.",
