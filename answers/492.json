  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input, \n    and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Iterate over each element in the sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # Append the element to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(flatten_list(list_of_lists))\n```\n\nThis program uses nested for loops to iterate over each sublist and each element in the sublists, appending each element to a result list. The result list is then returned.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input, \n    and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list of lists.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use a list comprehension to flatten the list of lists\n    return [element for sublist in list_of_lists for element in sublist]\n\n# Example usage:\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(flatten_list(list_of_lists))\n```\n\nBoth of these programs will output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`",
