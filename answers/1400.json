  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a text adventure game using Python:\n\n```python\ndef start_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the text adventure game!\")\n    print(\"You are standing at the entrance of a dark cave.\")\n    print(\"There is a path to the left and a path to the right.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Which path do you want to take? Type 'left' or 'right': \")\n        \n        if choice.lower() == \"left\":\n            print(\"You have taken the path to the left.\")\n            print(\"You come across a river. Do you want to swim across or follow the river?\")\n            \n            river_choice = input(\"Type 'swim' or 'follow': \")\n            \n            if river_choice.lower() == \"swim\":\n                print(\"You have swum across the river.\")\n                print(\"On the other side, you find a treasure chest.\")\n                print(\"Congratulations, you have won the game!\")\n                break\n            elif river_choice.lower() == \"follow\":\n                print(\"You have followed the river.\")\n                print(\"The river leads you to a waterfall.\")\n                print(\"Behind the waterfall, you find a hidden cave.\")\n                print(\"Unfortunately, the cave is empty.\")\n                print(\"Game over.\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n                \n        elif choice.lower() == \"right\":\n            print(\"You have taken the path to the right.\")\n            print(\"You come across a dense forest. Do you want to enter the forest or go back to the entrance?\")\n            \n            forest_choice = input(\"Type 'enter' or 'back': \")\n            \n            if forest_choice.lower() == \"enter\":\n                print(\"You have entered the forest.\")\n                print(\"In the forest, you find a group of friendly animals.\")\n                print(\"They offer to guide you through the forest.\")\n                print(\"After a while, they lead you to a beautiful meadow.\")\n                print(\"Congratulations, you have won the game!\")\n                break\n            elif forest_choice.lower() == \"back\":\n                print(\"You have gone back to the entrance.\")\n                print(\"You are now back at the start of the game.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n                \n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_game()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. The `start_game` function is defined to contain the game logic.\n2. The game starts with a welcome message and presents the user with a choice between two paths.\n3. The user's choice is read and processed using an `if-elif-else` statement.\n4. Depending on the user's choice, the game presents new choices and responds accordingly.\n5. The game continues until the user reaches a winning or losing condition, at which point the game ends.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The user chooses to take the path to the left and then decides to swim across the river, leading to a winning condition.\n* The user chooses to take the path to the right and then decides to enter the forest, leading to a winning condition.\n* The user chooses to take the path to the left and then decides to follow the river, leading to a losing condition.\n* The user chooses to take the path to the right and then decides to go back to the entrance, leading to a restart of the game.",
