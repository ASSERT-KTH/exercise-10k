  "prompt": "Create a program that utilizes functions to perform advanced mathematical operations. The program should have separate functions for calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, the volume and surface area of a sphere, and the sum of the squares of two numbers. Each function should take the necessary parameters and return the calculated result. The main part of the program should prompt the user to choose an operation and then call the corresponding function with user-provided inputs.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```python\n# Rectangle Functions\ndef rect_area(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef rect_perimeter(a, b):\n    return 2 * (a + b)\n\n# Sphere Functions\ndef sphere_volume(r):\n    return (4/3) * 3.14159 * (r ** 3)\n\ndef sphere_surface_area(r):\n    return 4 * 3.14159 * (r ** 2)\n\n# Sum of Squares Function\ndef sum_squares(a, b):\n    return a ** 2 + b ** 2\n\n# Main Program\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1.

It includes functions for calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, the volume and surface area of a sphere, and the sum of the squares of two numbers. The user can choose an operation, enter the required inputs, and view the results. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.",
