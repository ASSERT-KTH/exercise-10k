  "answer": "### Reading Name and Age from User and Printing Greeting Message\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Age must be an integer.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message with the user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to enter their name and age.\n2. It includes input validation to ensure the age is an integer. If the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer, it asks again.\n3. The `print_greeting` function takes the user's name and age as arguments and prints out a greeting message.\n4. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `get_user_info` to get the user's details and then `print_greeting` to display the greeting.\n\n### Running the Code\n\n- Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `greeting.py`.\n- Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n- Run the script using Python, for example, `python greeting.py`.\n- Follow the prompts to enter your name and age, and the script will print out a personalized greeting message.",
