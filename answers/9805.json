  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a variable and its value, then determines and prints out the data type of the variable. The program should be able to handle at least five different data types: integer, float, string, boolean, and list. Use a dictionary to map the variable names to their respective values and iterate over the dictionary to print out the variable names and their corresponding data types.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Variables and Dictionary\nx = 10\ny = 10.5\nz = \"hello\"\na = True\nb = [1, 2, 3]\n\ndic = {\"x\": x, \"y\": y, \"z\": z, \"a\": a, \"b\": b}\n\n# Loop and Print\nfor k, v in dic.items():\n    print(f\"variable: {k}, value: {v}, datatype: {type(v).__name__}\")\n```\nThis code defines the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `a`, and `b` with the specified values, creates a dictionary `dic` with the variables as keys and their values as values, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the dictionary and print out the variable names, values, and data types for each item in the dictionary.",
