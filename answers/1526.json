  "answer": "**Coin Change Problem**\n=========================\n\nThe coin change problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to solve the coin change problem:\n```python\ndef coin_change(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        coins (list): A list of coin denominations.\n        amount (int): The amount to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed. If it's not possible to make change, return -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # We need 0 coins to make 0 amount\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # Return the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n# Example usage:\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(coin_change(coins, amount))  # Output: 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)\n```\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThe solution uses a dynamic programming approach to build a table `dp` that stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount.\n\n1. Initialize the table `dp` with infinite values, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0 (we need 0 coins to make 0 amount).\n2. Iterate over each coin denomination.\n3. For each coin denomination, iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount.\n4. Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount by taking the minimum of the current value and the value of the previous amount minus the coin denomination plus 1.\n5. Return the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount. If it's not possible to make change, return -1.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the target amount and len(coins) is the number of coin denominations.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of the solution is O(amount), where amount is the target amount.",
