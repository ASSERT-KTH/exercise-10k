The program defines a function `calculate_quadratic_solutions` that takes the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input and returns the solutions to the quadratic equation.\n2.  The function calculates the discriminant `b^2 - 4ac` to determine the nature of the solutions.\n3.  Based on the discriminant, the function calculates the solutions using the quadratic formula `x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`.\n4.  If the discriminant is positive, the function returns two distinct real solutions. If the discriminant is zero, the function returns one real solution. If the discriminant is negative, the function returns two complex solutions.\n5.  The `main` function gets the coefficients from the user, calculates the solutions using the `calculate_quadratic_solutions` function, and prints the solutions.",
