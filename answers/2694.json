  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks the strength of a given password based on the following conditions:\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a given password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the conditions for a strong password\n    conditions = {\n        \"length\": len(password) >= 8,\n        \"uppercase\": any(char.isupper() for char in password),\n        \"lowercase\": any(char.islower() for char in password),\n        \"number\": any(char.isdigit() for char in password),\n    }\n\n    # Check if all conditions are met\n    if all(conditions.values()):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef get_password_feedback(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides feedback on the strength of a given password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating the strength of the password and any missing conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the conditions for a strong password\n    conditions = {\n        \"length\": len(password) >= 8,\n        \"uppercase\": any(char.isupper() for char in password),\n        \"lowercase\": any(char.islower() for char in password),\n        \"number\": any(char.isdigit() for char in password),\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the feedback message\n    feedback = \"Password strength: \"\n\n    # Check if all conditions are met\n    if all(conditions.values()):\n        feedback += \"Strong\"\n    else:\n        feedback += \"Weak\"\n        missing_conditions = [key for key, value in conditions.items() if not value]\n        if \"length\" in missing_conditions:\n            feedback += \"\\n* Password must be at least 8 characters long.\"\n        if \"uppercase\" in missing_conditions:\n            feedback += \"\\n* Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\"\n        if \"lowercase\" in missing_conditions:\n            feedback += \"\\n* Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\"\n        if \"number\" in missing_conditions:\n            feedback += \"\\n* Password must contain at least one number.\"\n\n    return feedback\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the password from the user\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n\n    # Check the password strength\n    if check_password_strength(password):\n        print(\"Password is strong.\")\n    else:\n        print(get_password_feedback(password))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a strong password (e.g., \"Password123\") to see the \"Password is strong\" message.\n* Run the program and enter a weak password (e.g., \"password\") to see the \"Password strength: Weak\" message with feedback on the missing conditions.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always use a strong password for your accounts to prevent unauthorized access.\n* Use a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account.\n* Avoid using easily guessable information, such as your name, birthdate, or common words, in your password.",
