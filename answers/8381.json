The `taylor_sine`, `taylor_cosine`, and `taylor_tangent` functions take an angle in radians and an optional number of terms to use in the Taylor series. The tangent is calculated as the ratio of the sine and cosine.\n\nNote that this solution uses a recursive approach for calculating the factorial and power, which may not be the most efficient approach for large inputs. An iterative approach may be more suitable for larger inputs.\n\nAlso, the Taylor series expansion is an approximation, and the accuracy of the result depends on the number of terms used. Increasing the number of terms will generally improve the accuracy of the result, but may also increase the computational cost.",
