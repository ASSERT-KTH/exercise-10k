Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Base case**: If the input number `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined to be 1.\n2. **Recursive case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1`, and multiplies the result by `n`. This process continues until the base case is reached.\n3. **Error handling**: If the input number is negative, the function raises a `ValueError`, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* `factorial(5)` returns `120`, since 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n* `factorial(0)` returns `1`, since 0! is defined to be 1\n* `factorial(-1)` raises a `ValueError`, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers",
