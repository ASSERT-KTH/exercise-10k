  "prompt": "Write a program that sets an alarm for a specific time. The program should take the current time and the alarm time as input, and print 'Wake Up' if the current time matches the alarm time.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef set_alarm(alarm_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sets an alarm for a specific time.\n\n    Args:\n        alarm_time (str): The time at which the alarm should go off, in the format 'HH:MM:SS'.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get the current time\n        current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')\n\n        # Check if the current time matches the alarm time\n        if current_time == alarm_time:\n            print('Wake Up')\n            break\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current time\n    current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')\n    print(f'Current Time: {current_time}')\n\n    # Get the alarm time from the user\n    alarm_time = input('Enter the alarm time in the format HH:MM:SS: ')\n\n    # Set the alarm\n    set_alarm(alarm_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works by continuously checking the current time and comparing it to the alarm time. When the two times match, it prints 'Wake Up' and stops.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the alarm time in the format 'HH:MM:SS' when prompted. The program will then start checking the current time and will print 'Wake Up' when the current time matches the alarm time.\n\nNote: This program will run indefinitely until the alarm time is reached. If you want to stop the program before the alarm time is reached, you will need to manually stop it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).",
