  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the distance traveled and amount of fuel consumed as input and outputs the fuel efficiency.",
  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n    - distance (float): Distance traveled in kilometers.\n    - fuel_consumed (float): Amount of fuel consumed in liters.\n\n    Returns:\n    - fuel_efficiency (float): Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumed <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Fuel consumed must be greater than zero.\")\n\n    fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumed\n    return fuel_efficiency\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed in liters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate fuel efficiency\n    try:\n        fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)\n        print(f\"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} km/L\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance traveled in kilometers when prompted.\n3. Enter the amount of fuel consumed in liters when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter.\n\n### Note\nThis program assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., distance and fuel consumed are non-negative, and fuel consumed is greater than zero). If invalid input is provided, the program will raise an error.",
