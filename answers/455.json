  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game**\n=======================\n\nHere's a simple Python program that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a word by shuffling its letters.\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the word scramble game.\"\"\"\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n\n    print(\"Unscramble the letters to form a valid English word:\")\n    print(scrambled_word)\n\n    # Ask the user for their answer\n    answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n\n    # Check if the answer is correct\n    if answer.lower() == word:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to start the game.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!\")\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Would you like to play again? (y/n): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Play:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a scrambled word.\n3. Try to unscramble the word and enter your answer.\n4. The program will tell you if your answer is correct or not.\n5.
