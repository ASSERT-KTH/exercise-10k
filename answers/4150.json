  "answer": "**Accessing Dictionary Values with the get() Method**\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe `get()` method in Python is used to retrieve the value for a given key from a dictionary. It provides a safe way to access dictionary values, as it returns `None` by default if the key is not found, instead of raising a `KeyError`.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```python\ndef access_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Access a value from a dictionary using the get() method.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key: The key to look up in the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        The value associated with the key, or None if the key is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dictionary.get(key)\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(access_dict_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Output: John\nprint(access_dict_value(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Output: None\n\n# Providing a default value\nprint(access_dict_value(my_dict, \"city\", \"New York\"))  # Output: New York\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `access_dict_value` function takes a dictionary and a key as arguments.\n*   It uses the `get()` method to retrieve the value associated with the key.\n*   If the key is not found in the dictionary, the `get()` method returns `None` by default.\n*   You can also provide a default value as a second argument to the `get()` method, which will be returned if the key is not found.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Always use the `get()` method to access dictionary values, unless you are certain that the key exists in the dictionary.\n*   Consider providing a default value when using the `get()` method to handle missing keys in a more explicit way.",
