  "answer": "**Word Guessing Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a word as input and lets the user guess the word by suggesting letters. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of:\n\n* `*` if the letter is not in the word\n* The letter itself if it is in the word\n* The program ends when the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef word_guessing_game(word, attempts=6):\n    \"\"\"\n    Word guessing game function.\n\n    Args:\n    word (str): The word to be guessed.\n    attempts (int): The number of attempts the user has. Defaults to 6.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the user guessed the word, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = [\"_\"] * len(word)\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_letters = []\n    guessed_words = []\n    tries = attempts\n\n    print(\"Let's play a word guessing game!\")\n    print(display_word(word_list))\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    while not guessed and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Please guess a letter or word: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_letters:\n                print(\"You already guessed the letter\", guess)\n            elif guess not in word:\n                print(guess, \"is not in the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            else:\n                print(\"Good job,\", guess, \"is in the word!\")\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n                word_as_list = list(word)\n                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n                for index in indices:\n                    word_list[index] = guess\n        elif len(guess) == len(word) and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_words:\n                print(\"You already guessed the word\", guess)\n            elif guess != word:\n                print(guess, \"is not the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_words.append(guess)\n            else:\n                guessed = True\n                word_list = list(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Not a valid guess.\")\n        \n        print(display_word(word_list))\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n    if guessed:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you ran out of tries.

Run the program.\n2. Enter a word for the game when prompted.\n3. The program will display a series of underscores representing the word.\n4. Guess a letter or the word by typing it in when prompted.\n5. The program will provide feedback in the form of `*` for incorrect guesses or the letter itself for correct guesses.\n6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.",
