  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that merges two dictionaries into a new dictionary, containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we'll create a new empty dictionary that will store the merged key-value pairs.\n    merged_dict = {}\n\n    # Now, we'll iterate over the key-value pairs in the first dictionary.\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # For each key-value pair, we'll add it to our new merged dictionary.\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n\n    # Next, we'll do the same for the second dictionary.\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # If a key already exists in the merged dictionary, its value will be updated with the value from the second dictionary.\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n\n    # Finally, we'll return our merged dictionary.\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the built-in dictionary update method or the {**dict1, **dict2} syntax to achieve the same result in a more concise way.\ndef merge_dictionaries_concise(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We'll create a copy of the first dictionary to avoid modifying it directly.\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n\n    # Then, we'll update our merged dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary.\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n\n    # Finally, we'll return our merged dictionary.\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Or, using the {**dict1, **dict2} syntax:\ndef merge_dictionaries_concise_syntax(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We can directly return a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `merge_dictionaries` function initializes an empty dictionary `merged_dict` to store the combined key-value pairs from both input dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2`.\n* It then iterates over the key-value pairs in `dict1` and `dict2`, adding each pair to `merged_dict`. If a key already exists in `merged_dict`, its value is updated with the value from the second dictionary.\n* Alternatively, the `merge_dictionaries_concise` function uses the built-in dictionary `update` method to merge the key-value pairs from `dict2` into a copy of `dict1`, while `merge_dictionaries_concise_syntax` utilizes the `{**dict1, **dict2}` syntax for a more concise solution.\n* All three functions return a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries, ensuring that the original dictionaries remain unchanged.",
