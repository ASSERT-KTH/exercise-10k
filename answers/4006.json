  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table():\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for j in range(1, 11):\n            print(f\"{i} x {j} = {i * j}\", end='\\t')\n        print()\n\nprint_multiplication_table()\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n*   We define a function `print_multiplication_table()` that contains the nested for loops.\n*   The outer loop iterates over the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive) using `range(1, 11)`.\n*   The inner loop also iterates over the numbers 1 to 10.\n*   Inside the inner loop, we print the multiplication of `i` and `j` using an f-string.\n*   We use `end='\\t'` to separate the results with tabs for better readability.\n*   After the inner loop completes for each `i`, we print a newline to move to the next line.\n*   Finally, we call the `print_multiplication_table()` function to print the multiplication table.\n\nThe output will be a 10x10 table showing the multiplication results for numbers 1 to 10.",
