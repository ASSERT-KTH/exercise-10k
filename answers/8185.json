  "answer": "**Coin Flip Simulator**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a coin flip using a while loop and asks the user if they want to flip again.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    \"\"\"Simulates a coin flip and returns the result.\"\"\"\n    return \"Heads\" if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else \"Tails\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user if they want to flip a coin and repeats until they choose to stop.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        print(f\"You got: {coin_flip()}\")\n        response = input(\"Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): \")\n        if response.lower() != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `coin_flip` function simulates a coin flip by generating a random integer (0 or 1) and returning \"Heads\" if the number is 0, and \"Tails\" if the number is 1.\n2. The `main` function contains a while loop that continues to ask the user if they want to flip again until they choose to stop.\n3. Inside the loop, the program prints the result of the coin flip and asks the user for their response.\n4. If the user types \"yes\", the loop continues and another coin flip is simulated. If the user types anything other than \"yes\", the loop breaks and the program ends.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g. `coin_flip.py`) and run it from the command line using `python coin_flip.py`. Follow the prompts to simulate a coin flip and choose whether to flip again.",
