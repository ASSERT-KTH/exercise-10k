  "prompt": "Create a function that checks if a given string is valid according to the following rules: it must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character. The function should return 'Valid' if the string meets all the rules, and 'Invalid' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that checks if a given string meets specific validation rules and provide a clear explanation of the code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is valid according to the following rules:\n    it must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: 'Valid' if the string meets all the rules, 'Invalid' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we'll assume the string is invalid until we've checked all the rules\n    result = 'Invalid'\n\n    # Check if the string contains at least one uppercase letter\n    has_uppercase = any(char.isupper() for char in s)\n    \n    # Check if the string contains at least one lowercase letter\n    has_lowercase = any(char.islower() for char in s)\n    \n    # Check if the string contains at least one digit\n    has_digit = any(char.isdigit() for char in s)\n    \n    # Check if the string contains at least one special character\n    # We'll use the fact that special characters are neither letters nor digits\n    has_special_char = any(not char.isalnum() for char in s)\n    \n    # If all rules are met, update the result to 'Valid'\n    if has_uppercase and has_lowercase and has_digit and has_special_char:\n        result = 'Valid'\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_string` initializes a variable `result` to 'Invalid' and then checks the input string `s` against four rules: containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.\n* It uses the `any` function in combination with generator expressions and string methods like `isupper`, `islower`, `isdigit`, and `isalnum` to check each rule, storing the results in variables like `has_uppercase` and `has_special_char`.\n* If all rules are met (i.e., all the `has_` variables are `True`), it updates `result` to 'Valid'.\n* Finally, the function returns `result`, indicating whether the input string is valid or not according to the predefined rules.",
