  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices separately. The function should return a list or array with two elements, where the first element is the sum of elements at even indices and the second element is the sum of elements at odd indices.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of elements at even and odd indices in an array, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_odd_indices(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements at even indices and the sum of all elements at odd indices in a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list with two elements, where the first element is the sum of elements at even indices and the second element is the sum of elements at odd indices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two variables to store the sum of elements at even and odd indices\n    even_sum = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the variable for odd sum\n    odd_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the array with the index and value\n    for i, num in enumerate(array):\n        \n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # If the index is even, add the value to the even sum\n            even_sum += num\n        else:\n            # If the index is odd, add the value to the odd sum\n            odd_sum += num\n    \n    # Return a list with the even sum and the odd sum\n    return [even_sum, odd_sum]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(sum_even_odd_indices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We initialize two variables, `even_sum` and `odd_sum`, to store the sum of elements at even and odd indices, respectively. These variables are initialized to 0, ensuring we start with a clean slate for our calculations.\n* We use the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input array, which provides both the index `i` and the value `num` of each element. This allows us to easily check whether an index is even or odd using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`).\n* Inside the loop, we update `even_sum` or `odd_sum` based on whether the current index is even or odd, effectively accumulating the sums of elements at even and odd indices separately.\n* Finally, we return a list containing `even_sum` and `odd_sum`, providing the desired output as per the problem statement.",
