  "answer": "### Lambda Function to Double a Number\n\nHere is a simple lambda function in Python that takes a number as an argument and returns its double:\n\n```python\ndouble_number = lambda x: x * 2\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nYou can use this lambda function like any other function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define the lambda function\ndouble_number = lambda x: x * 2\n\n# Test the function\nnumber = 5\nresult = double_number(number)\n\nprint(f\"The double of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe double of 5 is 10\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how to define and use a lambda function to double a number in Python. \n\n### Using the Lambda Function with a Map\n\nYou can also use this lambda function with the `map()` function to double multiple numbers at once:\n\n```python\n# Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Use the lambda function with map() to double the numbers\ndoubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))\n\nprint(doubled_numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```",
