  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Function**\n======================================\n\nHere's a Python function that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_rock_paper_scissors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get the user's choice\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \").lower()\n\n        # Generate the computer's choice\n        choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Determine the winner\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        # Ask the user if they want to play again\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_rock_paper_scissors()\n```\n\n**How the Function Works:**\n\n1. The function enters a loop that continues until the user decides to stop playing.\n2. Inside the loop, the function asks the user for their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and validates the input to ensure it's one of the allowed choices.\n3. The function generates the computer's choice by randomly selecting one of the allowed choices.\n4. The function determines the winner based on the game's rules and prints the result.\n5. The function asks the user if they want to play again and updates the loop accordingly.\n\n**Game Rules:**\n\n* Rock smashes scissors, so rock wins against scissors.\n* Paper covers rock, so paper wins against rock.\n* Scissors cuts paper, so scissors wins against paper.\n* If both players select the same choice, the result is a tie.",
