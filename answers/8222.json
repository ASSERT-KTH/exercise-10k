  "answer": "**Highest Score Finder Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program finds the highest score among a list of scores using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_highest_score(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the highest score among a list of scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The highest score.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(scores) == 0:\n        return None  # Return None if the list is empty\n\n    highest_score = scores[0]  # Initialize the highest score as the first score\n\n    for score in scores[1:]:\n        if score > highest_score:\n            highest_score = score  # Update the highest score if a higher score is found\n\n    return highest_score\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    scores = [80, 90, 70, 95, 85]\n    highest_score = find_highest_score(scores)\n\n    if highest_score is not None:\n        print(f\"The highest score is: {highest_score}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The list of scores is empty.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_highest_score` function takes a list of scores as input and returns the highest score.\n2. It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `None`.\n3. It then initializes the highest score as the first score in the list.\n4. It iterates through the rest of the scores in the list, and for each score, it checks if it is higher than the current highest score.\n5. If a higher score is found, it updates the highest score.\n6. Finally, it returns the highest score.\n7. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `find_highest_score` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Finding the highest score in a list of exam scores\n* Finding the highest score in a list of game scores\n* Finding the highest score in a list of quiz scores\n\nNote: This program assumes that the list of scores only contains numeric values. If the list can contain non-numeric values, you may need to add additional error checking.",
