  "answer": "**Decision Maker Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program uses conditional statements to make decisions based on given conditions.\n\n### Program Code\n\n```python\ndef get_decision(age, score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Make a decision based on age and score.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n        score (int): The score of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The decision made based on the conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    if age < 18:\n        return \"You are not eligible to participate.\"\n    elif score < 50:\n        return \"You need to improve your score.\"\n    elif score < 80:\n        return \"You are eligible to participate, but need to practice more.\"\n    else:\n        return \"You are eligible to participate and have a good chance of winning.\"\n\ndef get_day_of_week(day_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the day of the week based on the day number.\n\n    Args:\n        day_number (int): The day number (1-7).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The day of the week.\n    \"\"\"\n    match day_number:\n        case 1:\n            return \"Monday\"\n        case 2:\n            return \"Tuesday\"\n        case 3:\n            return \"Wednesday\"\n        case 4:\n            return \"Thursday\"\n        case 5:\n            return \"Friday\"\n        case 6:\n            return \"Saturday\"\n        case 7:\n            return \"Sunday\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Invalid day number\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Decision Maker Program\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    score = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n    decision = get_decision(age, score)\n    print(f\"Decision: {decision}\")\n\n    day_number = int(input(\"Enter the day number (1-7): \"))\n    day_of_week = get_day_of_week(day_number)\n    print(f\"Day of the week: {day_of_week}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses two functions: `get_decision` and `get_day_of_week`.\n\n1.  **`get_decision` function**: This function takes two arguments, `age` and `score`, and makes a decision based on the conditions.\n    *   If the age is less than 18, it returns a message stating that the person is not eligible to participate.\n    *   If the score is less than 50, it returns a message stating that the person needs to improve their score.\n    *   If the score is less than 80, it returns a message stating that the person is eligible to participate but needs to practice more.\n    *   If the score is 80 or more, it returns a message stating that the person is eligible to participate and has a good chance of winning.\n2.  **`get_day_of_week` function**: This function takes one argument, `day_number`, and returns the corresponding day of the week using a `match` statement.\n    *   The `match` statement is used to match the `day_number` with the corresponding day of the week.\n    *   If the `day_number` is not between 1 and 7, it returns an \"Invalid day number\" message.\n3.  **`main` function**: This function is the entry point of the program.\n    *   It prompts the user to enter their age and score, and then calls the `get_decision` function to make a decision based on the input values.\n    *   It then prompts the user to enter a day number and calls the `get_day_of_week` function to get the corresponding day of the week.\n    *   Finally, it prints the decision and the day of the week to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Run the program and enter an age of 25 and a score of 90. The program should print \"You are eligible to participate and have a good chance of winning.\"\n*   Run the program and enter an age of 15 and a score of 60. The program should print \"You are not eligible to participate.\"\n*   Run the program and enter a day number of 3. The program should print \"Wednesday\" as the day of the week.",
