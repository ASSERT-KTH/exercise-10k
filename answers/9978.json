  "answer": "**Constant Variables Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of constant variables in Python. Constant variables are variables that cannot be changed once they are assigned a value.\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\n# Define a constant variable\nPI = 3.14159\n\ndef main():\n    # Attempt to change the value of the constant variable\n    try:\n        PI = 2.71828\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Since Python does not have a built-in constant variable type, we'll use a NameError to simulate an error\n        print(\"Error: Cannot change the value of a constant variable.\")\n\n    # Print the original value of the constant variable\n    print(\"The value of PI is:\", PI)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHowever, Python does not have built-in support for constant variables. The above code will not throw an error when trying to change the value of `PI`. To achieve similar behavior, you can use a class with a property that raises an exception when trying to set a new value.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n---------------------------\n\n```python\nclass Constants:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._PI = 3.14159\n\n    @property\n    def PI(self):\n        return self._PI\n\n    @PI.setter\n    def PI(self, value):\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot change the value of a constant variable.\")\n\ndef main():\n    constants = Constants()\n    print(\"The value of PI is:\", constants.PI)\n\n    # Attempt to change the value of the constant variable\n    try:\n        constants.PI = 2.71828\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Output**\n-----\n\n```\nThe value of PI is: 3.14159\nError: Cannot change the value of a constant variable.\n```\n\nThis alternative implementation uses a class with a property to simulate a constant variable. The `PI` property has a getter that returns the value of `_PI`, and a setter that raises a `ValueError` when trying to set a new value.",
