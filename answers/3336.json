  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array, preserving the order of equal elements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Integer[] array = {5, 2, 8, 2, 1, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 9};\n        Integer[] sortedArray = stableSort(array);\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sortedArray));\n    }\n\n    public static Integer[] stableSort(Integer[] array) {\n        // Implement a stable sorting algorithm, such as merge sort or insertion sort\n        Arrays.sort(array);\n        return array;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a `stableSort` method that takes an array of integers as input, sorts it using the `Arrays.sort` method, and returns the sorted array. The `main` method tests this method by creating an array of integers, sorting it, and printing the sorted array.\n\nNote that the `Arrays.sort` method in Java is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the order of equal elements. If you need to implement a custom sorting algorithm, you can replace the `Arrays.sort` method with your own implementation.",
