  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given integer is a prime number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is prime or not.\n2. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns False, as prime numbers are greater than 1.\n3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (rounded up to the nearest integer). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers (i.e., `n % i == 0`), it returns False, as `n` is not prime.\n4. If the function completes the iteration without finding a divisor, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks whether it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23: The program will output \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 30: The program will output \"30 is not a prime number.\"\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0 or 1: The program will output \"0 is not a prime number.\" or \"1 is not a prime number.\"",
