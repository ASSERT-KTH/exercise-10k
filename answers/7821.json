  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use if/else statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    cin >> x;\n\n    if (x >= 90 && x <= 100) {\n        cout << \"A\";\n    } else if (x >= 80 && x < 90) {\n        cout << \"B\";\n    } else if (x >= 70 && x < 80) {\n        cout << \"C\";\n    } else if (x >= 60 && x < 70) {\n        cout << \"D\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"F\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer `x` from the standard input, determines the grade based on the score, and prints the corresponding grade to the standard output. The `if`/`else if`/`else` chain checks the score against the grade criteria and prints the corresponding grade. Note that the `return 0` statement is included to indicate successful termination of the program.",
