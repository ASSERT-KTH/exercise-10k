  "prompt": "Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user, where the computer generates a random choice and the program determines the winner",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the computer's random choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"Rock\" and computer_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"Scissors\" and computer_choice == \"Paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"Paper\" and computer_choice == \"Rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        elif user_choice not in [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer from the list `[\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]`.\n2. The `determine_winner` function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input and determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. The `main` function is the program's entry point. It welcomes the user to the game and enters a loop where it asks for the user's choice.\n4. If the user enters 'q', the program exits the loop and ends. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program asks again.\n5. Once the user enters a valid choice, the program generates the computer's choice, displays both choices, and determines the winner using the `determine_winner` function.\n6. The program then displays the result and asks for the user's choice again.",
