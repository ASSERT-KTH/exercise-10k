  "answer": "**Quote Generator Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random quote from a predefined list of quotes.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of quotes\nquotes = [\n    {\"quote\": \"Believe you can and you're halfway there.\", \"author\": \"Theodore Roosevelt\"},\n    {\"quote\": \"It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\", \"author\": \"Confucius\"},\n    {\"quote\": \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\", \"author\": \"Winston Churchill\"},\n    {\"quote\": \"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.\", \"author\": \"Sam Levenson\"},\n    {\"quote\": \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\", \"author\": \"Wayne Gretzky\"}\n]\n\ndef generate_random_quote(quotes):\n    \"\"\"Returns a random quote from the list of quotes\"\"\"\n    random_quote = random.choice(quotes)\n    return random_quote\n\ndef print_quote(quote):\n    \"\"\"Prints the quote and its author\"\"\"\n    print(f\"'{quote['quote']}' - {quote['author']}\")\n\ndef main():\n    random_quote = generate_random_quote(quotes)\n    print_quote(random_quote)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n------------------------\n\n1. The program defines a list of quotes, where each quote is a dictionary containing the quote text and its author.\n2. The `generate_random_quote` function selects a random quote from the list using the `random.choice` function.\n3. The `print_quote` function prints the selected quote and its author.\n4. In the `main` function, the program generates a random quote and prints it out.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\n'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill\n```\n\nYou can run this program to generate a random quote. Each time you run the program, you will get a different quote.",
