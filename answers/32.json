  "answer": "**Function to Generate Prime Numbers up to a Given Integer**\n\n### Overview\nThe following function generates a list of prime numbers up to a given integer. This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding all primes smaller than a specified number.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef get_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime numbers up to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit for generating prime numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of prime numbers up to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    # Create a boolean array, prime, of size n+1\n    prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = False\n    \n    # Iterate from 2 to sqrt(n)\n    for p in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # If p is a prime, mark as composite all the multiples of p\n        if prime[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):\n                prime[i] = False\n    \n    # Return a list of all prime numbers in the range\n    return [p for p in range(2, n + 1) if prime[p]]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 30\n    primes = get_primes(n)\n    print(f\"Prime numbers up to {n}: {primes}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The function `get_primes(n)` initializes a boolean array `prime` of size `n+1` and sets `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to `False`, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.\n2. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and marks as composite (i.e., sets to `False`) all the multiples of each prime number `p`.\n3. Finally, it returns a list of all prime numbers in the range by iterating over the `prime` array and including the indices of the elements that are still set to `True`.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log log n), making it efficient for generating prime numbers up to large numbers.",
