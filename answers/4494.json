  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generation**\n=====================================\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(f\"The first {n} Fibonacci numbers are: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `generate_fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n*   The base cases are handled first: if `n` is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned; if `n` is 1, the list `[0]` is returned; if `n` is 2, the list `[0, 1]` is returned.\n*   For `n` greater than 2, the Fibonacci sequence is generated iteratively. The list `fib_sequence` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `[0, 1]`. Then, a while loop is used to append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence until the desired length `n` is reached.\n*   In the example usage, we generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and print the resulting sequence.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe first 10 Fibonacci numbers are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\nThis code provides a clear and efficient way to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.",
