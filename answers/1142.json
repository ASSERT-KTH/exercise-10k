  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n\nBelow is a Python solution for the problem. This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How to use:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. You will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the number.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. The program will display the number of attempts it took you to find the correct number.\n\n**Note:** This program uses a simple `while` loop to continuously ask the user for their guess until they find the correct number. It also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer between 1 and 100.",
