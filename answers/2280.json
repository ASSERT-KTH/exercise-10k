  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator**\n==============================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor using the math.gcd function\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the least common multiple using the formula: lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    \n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    \n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two numbers as input and calculates their greatest common divisor using the `math.gcd` function.\n2. The least common multiple is then calculated using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_lcm` function with example numbers.\n\n**Example Output:**\n--------------------\n\n```\nThe least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\nYou can modify the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `main` function to test the program with different inputs.",
