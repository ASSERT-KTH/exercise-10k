  "answer": "### Merging Two Dictionaries\n#### Function Description\n\nThe function `merge_dictionaries` merges two input dictionaries into one. It combines the key-value pairs from both dictionaries and returns the resulting dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override those from the first.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the built-in dictionary update method to merge the dictionaries\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nmerged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n#### Alternative Solution (Python 3.5 and later)\n\nYou can also use the dictionary unpacking operator (`**`) to merge dictionaries in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nmerged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\nThis approach is more readable and efficient, especially when dealing with multiple dictionaries.",
