  "answer": "**Calculating the Area of a Triangle**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe `calculate_triangle_area` function calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle.\n\n    Args:\n    base (float): The base of the triangle.\n    height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be non-negative.\")\n\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    base = 5.0\n    height = 6.0\n    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n    print(f\"The area of the triangle with base {base} and height {height} is {area}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function takes two arguments: `base` and `height`, both of type `float`.\n*   It checks if either the base or height is negative, raising a `ValueError` if so.\n*   The area is calculated using the formula `0.5 * base * height`.\n*   The function returns the calculated area.\n*   In the example usage, we calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5.0 and a height of 6.0, then print the result.",
