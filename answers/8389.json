  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the binomial coefficient of two given numbers using Pascal's triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The total number of items.\n        k (int): The number of items to choose.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The binomial coefficient of n and k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store Pascal's triangle\n    triangle = [[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the first row and column of Pascal's triangle\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        triangle[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(k + 1):\n        triangle[j][j] = 1\n\n    # Calculate the rest of Pascal's triangle\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):\n            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]\n\n    # The binomial coefficient is stored in the nth row and kth column of Pascal's triangle\n    return triangle[n][k]\n\n# Test the function\nn = 5\nk = 3\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient of {n} and {k} is: {calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k)}\")\n```\n\nThis program creates Pascal's triangle up to the nth row, where n is the total number of items. It then returns the value in the kth column of the nth row, which is the binomial coefficient of n and k. \n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n*k) and a space complexity of O(n*k), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. \n\nAlso, note that this solution assumes that k is less than or equal to n. If k is greater than n, the function will still work, but it will return 0, because the binomial coefficient of n and k is 0 when k is greater than n. \n\nYou can also use the `math.comb` function from the Python `math` module to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is more efficient and convenient. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = 5\nk = 3\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient of {n} and {k} is: {math.comb(n, k)}\")\n```",
