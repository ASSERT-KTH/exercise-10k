  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a mathematical expression as input and evaluates it.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses the built-in `eval()` function to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression(expression):\n    try:\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        return str(e)\n\ndef main():\n    expression = input(\"Enter a mathematical expression: \")\n    result = evaluate_expression(expression)\n    print(\"Result: \", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The `evaluate_expression` function takes a string `expression` as input.\n2. It attempts to evaluate the expression using `eval()`.\n3. If the evaluation is successful, it returns the result.\n4. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid syntax or division by zero), it catches the exception and returns the error message.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a mathematical expression, calls `evaluate_expression` with the input, and prints the result.\n\n### Example use cases:\n- Simple arithmetic: `2 + 2`, `10 * 5`, `20 / 4`\n- Exponents: `2 ** 3`\n- Parentheses: `(2 + 3) * 4`\n\n### Important note:\nThe `eval()` function can pose a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input, as it can evaluate any Python expression. In this example, we're using it for simplicity, but for a real-world application, consider using a safer evaluation method, such as using a parsing library or writing a custom parser.",
