  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and outputs their average.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes that task:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num1, num2, num3):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average of three numbers.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    num3 (float): The third number.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3\n    return average\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the average\n    average = calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The average of the three numbers is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_average` that takes three numbers as input and returns their average. The `main` function gets three numbers from the user, calls `calculate_average` with these numbers, and prints the result.\n\nTo run this program, simply save it to a file (e.g., `average.py`), then run it with Python (e.g., `python average.py`). The program will prompt you to enter three numbers, and then it will print their average.",
