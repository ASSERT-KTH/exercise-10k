  "answer": "**Dictionary Difference Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two dictionaries with product names as keys and their prices as values. The resulting dictionary will contain products that are either present in one dictionary but not the other, or have different prices in the two dictionaries.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef dict_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the differences between the two input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    diff_dict = {}\n\n    # Find products in dict1 but not in dict2\n    for product, price in dict1.items():\n        if product not in dict2:\n            diff_dict[product] = price\n\n    # Find products in dict2 but not in dict1\n    for product, price in dict2.items():\n        if product not in dict1:\n            diff_dict[product] = price\n\n    # Find products with different prices\n    for product, price in dict1.items():\n        if product in dict2 and price != dict2[product]:\n            diff_dict[product] = (price, dict2[product])\n\n    return diff_dict\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example dictionaries\n    products1 = {\n        \"Apple\": 1.00,\n        \"Banana\": 0.50,\n        \"Cherry\": 2.00\n    }\n\n    products2 = {\n        \"Apple\": 1.00,\n        \"Banana\": 0.75,\n        \"Grapes\": 3.00\n    }\n\n    # Calculate and print the difference\n    difference = dict_difference(products1, products2)\n    print(\"Difference:\")\n    for product, price in difference.items():\n        if isinstance(price, tuple):\n            print(f\"{product}: {price[0]} (in dict1) vs {price[1]} (in dict2)\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{product}: {price}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nDifference:\nBanana: 0.5 (in dict1) vs 0.75 (in dict2)\nCherry: 2.0\nGrapes: 3.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `dict_difference` function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing their differences.\n*   It iterates over the items in both dictionaries to find products that are either present in one dictionary but not the other, or have different prices.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `dict_difference` with two example dictionaries and prints the resulting difference dictionary.",
