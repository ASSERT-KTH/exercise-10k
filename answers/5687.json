  "answer": "Here is a simple implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The program randomly selects the computer's choice and then determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return user_choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The program starts by importing the `random` module to generate the computer's choice.\n2. The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n3. The `get_user_choice` function asks the user for their choice and validates the input to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n4. The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n5. The `main` function coordinates the game by getting the user's choice, generating the computer's choice, and then determining the winner.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Run the program and enter \"rock\" when prompted. The program will generate the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n* Run the program and enter \"paper\" when prompted. The program will generate the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n* Run the program and enter \"scissors\" when prompted. The program will generate the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n\nNote: This is a simple implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. You can enhance it by adding more features, such as keeping track of the score or allowing the user to play multiple rounds.",
