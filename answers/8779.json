  "answer": "**Subsequence Check Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given string is a subsequence of another string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(main_string, sub_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a subsequence of another string.\n\n    Args:\n        main_string (str): The main string to check against.\n        sub_string (str): The string to check if it's a subsequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if sub_string is a subsequence of main_string, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    main_index = 0\n    sub_index = 0\n\n    while main_index < len(main_string) and sub_index < len(sub_string):\n        if main_string[main_index] == sub_string[sub_index]:\n            sub_index += 1\n        main_index += 1\n\n    return sub_index == len(sub_string)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_str = \"hello world\"\n    sub_str = \"hwo\"\n    print(f\"Is '{sub_str}' a subsequence of '{main_str}'? {is_subsequence(main_str, sub_str)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `main_index` and `sub_index`, to 0. These pointers will be used to traverse the `main_string` and `sub_string` respectively.\n2. Loop through the `main_string` using `main_index`. For each character in `main_string`, check if it matches the character at the current `sub_index` in `sub_string`.\n3. If a match is found, increment `sub_index` to move to the next character in `sub_string`.\n4. Regardless of a match, increment `main_index` to move to the next character in `main_string`.\n5. The loop continues until either the end of `main_string` or `sub_string` is reached.\n6. After the loop, check if `sub_index` is equal to the length of `sub_string`. If it is, that means all characters in `sub_string` were found in `main_string` in the correct order, so `sub_string` is a subsequence of `main_string`. Otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of `main_string`, because in the worst case, we need to traverse the entire `main_string`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the result.",
