  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and outputs the compound interest.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates compound interest:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 5% = 0.05).\n        time (int): The time the money is invested for, in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the compound interest using the formula: A = P * (1 + r)^t\n    compound_interest = principal * ((1 + rate) ** time) - principal\n    return compound_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal, rate, and time from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the compound interest\n    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${compound_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input and returns the compound interest.\n*   The compound interest is calculated using the formula `A = P * (1 + r)^t`, where `A` is the amount after `t` years, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time.\n*   The `main` function gets the principal, rate, and time from the user, calculates the compound interest, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n*   Enter the principal amount: `$1000`\n*   Enter the interest rate (in %): `5`\n*   Enter the time (in years): `10`\n*   The compound interest is: `$628.89`",
