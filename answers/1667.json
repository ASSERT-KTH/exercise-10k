  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and classifies it as 'positive', 'negative', or 'zero' using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n```\ndef classify_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify a number as 'positive', 'negative', or 'zero'.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to classify.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The classification of the number ('positive', 'negative', or 'zero').\n    \"\"\"\n    if num > 0:\n        return \"positive\"\n    elif num < 0:\n        return \"negative\"\n    else:\n        return \"zero\"\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(classify_number(num))\n```\nI've implemented the program as a Python script, using a function `classify_number` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns a string indicating its classification. The function uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the classification based on the value of `num`.\n\nYou can run this program by saving it to a file (e.g., `classify_number.py`) and running it from the command line using `python classify_number.py`. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a number, and then it will print the classification of that number.\n\nNote that I've assumed that the input will be an integer, but if you want to handle floating-point numbers as well, you can modify the program accordingly. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!",
