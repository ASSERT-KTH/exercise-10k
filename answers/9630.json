  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that returns another function with access to its own scope, addressing your question with a step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that returns another function with access to its own scope.\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns another function with access to its own scope.\n\n    Args:\n        outer_variable (any): A variable that will be accessible in the inner function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A function that has access to the outer function's scope.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        # The inner function can access and use the outer_variable.\n        print(f\"Outer variable: {outer_variable}\")\n        print(f\"Inner variable: {inner_variable}\")\n\n    # Return the inner function.\n    return inner_function\n\n# Create a new function by calling the outer function with an argument.\nnew_function = outer_function(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n# Call the new function with an argument.\nnew_function(\"This is an inner variable.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `outer_function` takes an `outer_variable` as an argument and returns the `inner_function`, which has access to the `outer_function`'s scope.\n* The `inner_function` can access and use the `outer_variable` passed to the `outer_function`, as well as its own `inner_variable`.\n* By returning the `inner_function`, we create a closure that allows the `inner_function` to retain access to the `outer_function`'s scope even after the `outer_function` has finished executing.\n* We demonstrate this by creating a `new_function` by calling `outer_function` with an argument and then calling `new_function` with its own argument, showcasing the access to both the outer and inner variables.",
