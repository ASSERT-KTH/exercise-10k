  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that utilizes documentation strings to provide a clear description of its purpose and usage, making it easier for users to understand how to use the function. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    A function that generates a personalized greeting message.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to be greeted.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A greeting message with the provided name.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> greet('John')\n        'Hello, John!'\n        >>> greet('Alice')\n        'Hello, Alice!'\n    \"\"\"\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n\n# Test the function\nprint(greet('John'))  # Output: Hello, John!\nprint(greet('Alice'))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `greet` takes a `name` parameter of type `str` and returns a personalized greeting message as a `str`. This is clearly documented in the function's docstring, which describes its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples of usage.\n* The docstring is written in a format that is easily readable by both humans and machines, allowing tools like IDEs and documentation generators to parse and display the information.\n* The `Examples` section in the docstring shows how to use the function with different inputs, making it easier for users to understand how to apply the function in their own code.\n* By including a docstring, the function becomes more user-friendly and self-explanatory, reducing the need for external documentation or comments to explain its usage.",
