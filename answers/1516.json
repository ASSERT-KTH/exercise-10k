  "answer": "**First Duplicate Character Finder**\n=====================================\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate character in a given string.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first duplicate character, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    s = \"abcad\"\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(s)\n    if duplicate:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate character in '{s}' is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No duplicate characters found in '{s}'\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `find_first_duplicate` function iterates over each character in the input string `s`.\n2. It uses a `set` called `seen` to keep track of the characters it has encountered so far.\n3. For each character, it checks if the character is already in the `seen` set. If it is, it means the character is a duplicate, and the function returns it.\n4. If the character is not in the `seen` set, it adds the character to the set and continues to the next character.\n5. If the function iterates over the entire string without finding any duplicates, it returns `None`.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `find_first_duplicate` with an example string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it makes a single pass over the string.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the `seen` set will contain all characters from the input string.",
