  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the income using if/else statements to determine the tax rate.\n\n### Tax Rates\n\n* Income up to $10,000: 0%\n* Income between $10,001 and $20,000: 10%\n* Income between $20,001 and $50,000: 20%\n* Income above $50,000: 30%\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax amount based on the income.\n    \n    Args:\n        income (float): The income amount.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income <= 10000:\n        tax_rate = 0\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        tax_rate = 0.10\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        tax_rate = 0.20\n    else:\n        tax_rate = 0.30\n    \n    tax_amount = income * tax_rate\n    return tax_amount\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_amount = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax amount is: ${tax_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your take-home pay is: ${income - tax_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted (e.g., `60000`).\n3. The program will calculate and display your tax amount and take-home pay.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple if/else statement to determine the tax rate based on the income.\n* The tax rates are hardcoded in the program, but they can be modified or replaced with a more complex tax calculation formula as needed.\n* The `calculate_tax` function takes the income as input and returns the tax amount.\n* The `main` function gets the income from the user, calls the `calculate_tax` function, and displays the results.",
