  "prompt": "Write a function called 'sum_even_numbers' that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers. This will involve defining a function that iterates over the list, identifies even numbers, and sums them up. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers, starting at 0\n    even_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even by using the modulus operator (%)\n        # If the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0, it's even\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # If the number is even, add it to the sum\n            even_sum += num\n\n    # After iterating over all numbers, return the sum of even numbers\n    return even_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `sum_even_numbers` is defined with a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It initializes a variable `even_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of all even numbers found in the list.\n*   The function then iterates over each number `num` in the `numbers` list. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If `num % 2 == 0`, the number is even.\n*   If a number is identified as even, it is added to `even_sum`. This process continues until all numbers in the list have been checked.\n*   Finally, after iterating over all numbers, the function returns `even_sum`, which is the total sum of all even numbers in the list.",
