  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the difference\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The difference between {:.2f} and {:.2f} is {:.2f}\".format(num1, num2, difference))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_difference` function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.\n*   The `main` function gets user input for two numbers, calculates their difference using the `calculate_difference` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses the `float` data type to allow for decimal numbers and the `input` function to get user input.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Enter two integers, e.g., 10 and 5, to get their difference.\n*   Enter two decimal numbers, e.g., 10.5 and 5.2, to get their difference.\n*   Enter a negative number and a positive number, e.g., -5 and 10, to get their difference.",
