  "answer": "Here's an implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\ntarget = 23\nresult = binary_search(arr, target)\n\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialize pointers**: We start by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2. **Calculate mid**: We calculate the middle index of the current range using the formula `mid = (left + right) // 2`.\n3. **Compare elements**: We compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target element `target`.\n\t* If `arr[mid] == target`, we return the index `mid` as the target element is found.\n\t* If `arr[mid] < target`, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the array.\n\t* If `arr[mid] > target`, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the array.\n4. **Repeat steps 2-3**: We repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is greater than `right`.\n5. **Return result**: If the target element is not found, we return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we divide the search space in half with each iteration.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of binary search is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the target element.",
