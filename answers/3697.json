  "answer": "**Travel Expense Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the total travel expense given the cost of transportation, accommodation, and food.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_travel_expense(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, food_cost):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total travel expense.\n\n    Args:\n        transportation_cost (float): The cost of transportation.\n        accommodation_cost (float): The cost of accommodation.\n        food_cost (float): The cost of food.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total travel expense.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_expense = transportation_cost + accommodation_cost + food_cost\n    return total_expense\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Travel Expense Calculator\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    transportation_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of transportation: $\"))\n    accommodation_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of accommodation: $\"))\n    food_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of food: $\"))\n\n    # Calculate total travel expense\n    total_expense = calculate_travel_expense(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, food_cost)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Total travel expense: ${total_expense:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of transportation when prompted (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the cost of accommodation when prompted (e.g., 200).\n4. Enter the cost of food when prompted (e.g., 50).\n5. The program will calculate and print the total travel expense (e.g., $350.00).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple function to calculate the total travel expense.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_travel_expense` function, and prints the result.\n* The program uses `float` to handle decimal numbers.\n* The `:.2f` format specifier is used to print the result with two decimal places.",
