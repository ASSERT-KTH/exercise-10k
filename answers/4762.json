  "answer": "**Even or Odd Number Checker Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks whether a given number is even or odd. It uses the divisibility rule for 2 to determine if a number is even or odd.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_even_or_odd(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is even or odd.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: \"Even\" if the number is even, \"Odd\" otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        return \"Even\"\n    else:\n        return \"Odd\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = check_even_or_odd(num)\n    print(f\"The number {num} is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_even_or_odd` function takes an integer as input and returns a string indicating whether the number is even or odd.\n2. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0. If it is, the number is even.\n3. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `check_even_or_odd` function.\n4. The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a number: 10\n  Output: The number 10 is Even.\n* Enter a number: 11\n  Output: The number 11 is Odd.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `even_or_odd.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python even_or_odd.py`). Follow the prompt to enter a number, and the program will output whether the number is even or odd.",
