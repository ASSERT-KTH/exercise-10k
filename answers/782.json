  "answer": "**Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return area, perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Area: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the length and width of the rectangle when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_rectangle_properties` function takes the length and width of the rectangle as input and returns the area and perimeter.\n* The area is calculated as the product of the length and width.\n* The perimeter is calculated as twice the sum of the length and width.\n* The `main` function gets the length and width from the user, calculates the area and perimeter, and prints the results.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses Python 3.x syntax and is compatible with Python 3.6 and later versions.\n* The program uses floating-point numbers to allow for decimal lengths and widths.",
