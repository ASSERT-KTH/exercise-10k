  "answer": "**Quote Generator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program generates a random quote based on user input. The user can choose from a list of categories, and the program will display a random quote from the selected category.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Dictionary of quotes, categorized by theme\nquotes = {\n    \"inspiration\": [\n        \"Believe you can and you're halfway there. - Theodore Roosevelt\",\n        \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs\",\n        \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts. - Winston Churchill\"\n    ],\n    \"motivation\": [\n        \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky\",\n        \"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. - Thomas Edison\",\n        \"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. - Sam Levenson\"\n    ],\n    \"humor\": [\n        \"I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised. - Steve Martin\",\n        \"Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. - Unknown\",\n        \"I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down. - Steven Wright\"\n    ]\n}\n\ndef get_quote(category):\n    \"\"\"Returns a random quote from the specified category\"\"\"\n    return random.choice(quotes.get(category, [\"No quotes found in this category\"]))\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Quote Generator\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    categories = list(quotes.keys())\n    print(\"Available categories:\")\n    for i, category in enumerate(categories):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {category.capitalize()}\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter the number of your chosen category: \")\n    try:\n        choice = int(choice)\n        if 1 <= choice <= len(categories):\n            category = categories[choice - 1]\n            print(f\"\\nHere's a random quote from the {category} category:\")\n            print(get_quote(category))\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose a category by entering the corresponding number.\n3. The program will display a random quote from the selected category.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* The `quotes` dictionary stores quotes categorized by theme.\n* The `get_quote` function returns a random quote from the specified category.\n* The `main` function handles user input and displays the quote.\n* The program uses a simple text-based interface. You can modify it to use a GUI or web interface if needed.",
