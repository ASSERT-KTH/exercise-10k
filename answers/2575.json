  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a diamond pattern of asterisks:\n\n```python\ndef print_diamond(n):\n    # Print the top half of the diamond\n    for i in range(n):\n        print(' ' * (n - i - 1) + '*' * (2 * i + 1))\n\n    # Print the bottom half of the diamond\n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n        print(' ' * (n - i - 1) + '*' * (2 * i + 1))\n\n# Test the function\nprint_diamond(5)\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n*   The `print_diamond` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of rows in the top half of the diamond.\n*   The first nested for loop prints the top half of the diamond. It iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it prints a string consisting of two parts:\n    *   `' ' * (n - i - 1)`: This part prints a certain number of spaces to create the indentation needed for the diamond shape. The number of spaces decreases by 1 in each iteration.\n    *   `'*' * (2 * i + 1)`: This part prints a certain number of asterisks (\\*) to create the diamond shape. The number of asterisks increases by 2 in each iteration.\n*   The second nested for loop prints the bottom half of the diamond. It iterates from `n - 2` down to 0 (inclusive), and in each iteration, it prints a string similar to the one in the first loop. However, the number of spaces increases by 1, and the number of asterisks decreases by 2 in each iteration.\n*   Finally, the `print_diamond(5)` call tests the function with `n = 5`, printing a diamond pattern with 5 rows in the top half.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run the `print_diamond(5)` call, the program will print the following diamond pattern:\n\n```\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n *******\n  *****\n   ***\n    *\n```\n\nThis output demonstrates the diamond pattern created using nested for loops. You can adjust the input to the `print_diamond` function to print diamonds of different sizes.",
