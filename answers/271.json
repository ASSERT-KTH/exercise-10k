  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n==============================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    while num2 != 0:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return abs(num1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}.\")\n\n    # Using the math library's gcd function for comparison:\n    math_gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The math library's GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {math_gcd}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two numbers as input and returns their GCD.\n*   It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `num1` with `num2` and `num2` with the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2`, until `num2` becomes 0.\n*   At that point, `num1` is the GCD.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculate_gcd` with an example and compares the result with the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `gcd_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python gcd_calculator.py`). The program will output the GCD of the example numbers and compare it with the result from the `math` library.",
