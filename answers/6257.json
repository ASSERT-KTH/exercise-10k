  "answer": "### Splitting a Dictionary into Even and Odd Keys\n\nHere's a Python function that splits a dictionary into two dictionaries, one with even keys and one with odd keys.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef split_dict(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits a dictionary into two dictionaries, one with even keys and one with odd keys.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The input dictionary to be split.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two dictionaries. The first dictionary contains even keys, \n               and the second dictionary contains odd keys.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_dict = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if isinstance(key, int) and key % 2 == 0}\n    odd_dict = {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if isinstance(key, int) and key % 2 != 0}\n\n    return even_dict, odd_dict\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    input_dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e', 6: 'f'}\n    even_dict, odd_dict = split_dict(input_dict)\n\n    print(\"Even Dictionary:\")\n    print(even_dict)\n    print(\"\\nOdd Dictionary:\")\n    print(odd_dict)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `split_dict` function takes an input dictionary and uses dictionary comprehension to create two new dictionaries: `even_dict` and `odd_dict`.\n*   The `even_dict` includes key-value pairs where the key is an integer and the key is even (i.e., `key % 2 == 0`).\n*   The `odd_dict` includes key-value pairs where the key is an integer and the key is odd (i.e., `key % 2 != 0`).\n*   The function returns a tuple containing both dictionaries.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `split_dict` with an example dictionary and print the resulting even and odd dictionaries.",
