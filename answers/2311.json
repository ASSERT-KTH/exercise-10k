  "answer": "**Word Scramble Game**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a scrambled version of a word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nword_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scramble the letters of a word.\n    \n    Args:\n    word (str): The word to scramble.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play the word scramble game.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    \n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    \n    # Ask the user to unscramble the word\n    print(\"Unscramble the word: \", scrambled_word)\n    answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    \n    # Check if the answer is correct\n    if answer.lower() == word:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!\")\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    \n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Would you like to play again? (yes/no): \")\n    \n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `word_scramble.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python word_scramble.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, it will choose a random word from the list, scramble it, and ask you to unscramble it. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to the Word Scramble Game!\nUnscramble the word:  elppa\nEnter your answer: apple\nCorrect!\nWould you like to play again?
