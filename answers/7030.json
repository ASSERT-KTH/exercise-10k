It takes two numbers and an operation as input from the user, performs the operation, and prints the result.\n\n- The `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions perform the respective arithmetic operations.\n- The `perform_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, checks if the operation is valid, and calls the corresponding function.\n- The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls `perform_operation`, and handles any errors that may occur.\n- The program supports both word-based operations ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide') and symbol-based operations ('+', '-', '*', '/').\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Addition: Enter `5` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `add` or `+` as the operation. The output will be `8.0`.\n- Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `4` as the second number, and `subtract` or `-` as the operation. The output will be `6.0`.\n- Multiplication: Enter `7` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `multiply` or `*` as the operation. The output will be `14.0`.\n- Division: Enter `9` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `divide` or `/` as the operation. The output will be `3.0`.",
