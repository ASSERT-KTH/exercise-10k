  "answer": "**Rounding Number Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a number as input and returns its rounded value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef round_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Round the number\n    rounded_num = round_number(num)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The rounded number is:\", rounded_num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Input: `3.7`\n    Output: `4`\n*   Input: `3.2`\n    Output: `3`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The `round_number` function takes a number as input and uses the built-in `round` function to round it to the nearest integer.\n2.  The `main` function gets user input, calls the `round_number` function, and prints the result.\n3.  The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the program's entry point and a `round_number` function to encapsulate the rounding logic.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `round_number.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python round_number.py`). Then, follow the prompt to enter a number. The program will print the rounded number.",
