  "answer": "**Matrix Operations Program**\n================================\n\nThis program performs basic matrix operations such as addition and multiplication. It uses Python as the programming language and the NumPy library for matrix operations.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass MatrixOperations:\n    def __init__(self, matrix1, matrix2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the MatrixOperations class with two matrices.\n\n        Args:\n            matrix1 (list): The first matrix.\n            matrix2 (list): The second matrix.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.matrix1 = np.array(matrix1)\n        self.matrix2 = np.array(matrix2)\n\n    def add_matrices(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add two matrices element-wise.\n\n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The sum of the two matrices.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            return self.matrix1 + self.matrix2\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Matrices must have the same dimensions for addition.\")\n            return None\n\n    def multiply_matrices(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Multiply two matrices.\n\n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The product of the two matrices.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            return np.matmul(self.matrix1, self.matrix2)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for multiplication.\")\n            return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    matrix1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n    matrix2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]\n\n    operations = MatrixOperations(matrix1, matrix2)\n\n    print(\"Matrix 1:\")\n    print(operations.matrix1)\n    print(\"\\nMatrix 2:\")\n    print(operations.matrix2)\n\n    print(\"\\nAdding matrices:\")\n    print(operations.add_matrices())\n\n    print(\"\\nMultiplying matrices:\")\n    print(operations.multiply_matrices())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The program defines a `MatrixOperations` class that takes two matrices as input.\n2. The `add_matrices` method adds the two matrices element-wise using NumPy's `+` operator.\n3. The `multiply_matrices` method multiplies the two matrices using NumPy's `matmul` function.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `MatrixOperations` class with two example matrices.\n5. The program prints the results of the addition and multiplication operations.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Adding two matrices: `MatrixOperations([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]).add_matrices()`\n* Multiplying two matrices: `MatrixOperations([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]).multiply_matrices()`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input matrices are valid (i.e., they have the correct dimensions for addition and multiplication). If the input matrices are invalid, the program will print an error message and return `None`.",
