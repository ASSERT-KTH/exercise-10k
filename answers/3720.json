  "answer": "### Checking if a Graph is Connected\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function checks if a given graph is connected. A graph is considered connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_graph_connected(graph):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a graph is connected.\n\n    Args:\n    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the graph is connected, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the graph is empty\n    if not graph:\n        return False\n\n    # Choose an arbitrary node to start with\n    start_node = next(iter(graph))\n\n    # Create a set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Create a queue for BFS, enqueue the start node\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n\n    # Mark the start node as visited\n    visited.add(start_node)\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n\n        # For each neighbor of the current node\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            # If the neighbor has not been visited yet\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                # Mark it as visited and enqueue it\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n\n    # If all nodes have been visited, the graph is connected\n    return len(visited) == len(graph)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a connected graph\n    connected_graph = {\n        'A': ['B', 'C'],\n        'B': ['A', 'D'],\n        'C': ['A', 'D'],\n        'D': ['B', 'C']\n    }\n\n    # Define a disconnected graph\n    disconnected_graph = {\n        'A': ['B'],\n        'B': ['A'],\n        'C': ['D'],\n        'D': ['C']\n    }\n\n    print(is_graph_connected(connected_graph))  # Output: True\n    print(is_graph_connected(disconnected_graph))  # Output: False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThis function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph. It starts from an arbitrary node and visits all its neighbors. If it can reach all nodes in the graph, the graph is connected.\n\n1.  **Checking for an empty graph**: If the graph is empty, it's not connected.\n2.  **Choosing a start node**: Select an arbitrary node to start the BFS traversal.\n3.  **Creating a visited set**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4.  **Performing BFS**: Traverse the graph level by level, starting from the chosen node.\n5.  **Checking connectivity**: If all nodes have been visited, the graph is connected.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with both connected and disconnected graphs.",
