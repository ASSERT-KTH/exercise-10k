  "prompt": "Write a function that uses function overloading to calculate the sum of two numbers or the concatenation of two strings",
  "answer": "### Function Overloading in Python\nPython does not support function overloading in the classical sense, but we can use single dispatch to achieve similar behavior. We'll create a function that can handle both integers and strings.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import singledispatch\n\n@singledispatch\ndef calculate(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of two numbers or the concatenation of two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int or str): The first number or string.\n        b (int or str): The second number or string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or str: The sum of two numbers or the concatenation of two strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    raise TypeError(\"Unsupported type\")\n\n@calculate.register\ndef _(a: int, b: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of two integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n@calculate.register\ndef _(a: str, b: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Concatenates two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        a (str): The first string.\n        b (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The concatenation of two strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculate(1, 2))  # Outputs: 3\nprint(calculate(\"Hello, \", \"World!\"))  # Outputs: Hello, World!\n```\n\n### Explanation\nWe use the `@singledispatch` decorator from the `functools` module to create a single dispatch function. This allows us to define multiple functions with the same name but different type hints.\n\nWe then use the `@calculate.register` decorator to register functions for specific types. In this case, we have two registered functions: one for integers and one for strings.\n\nIf the input types do not match any of the registered functions, a `TypeError` is raised.\n\nNote that this implementation does not handle cases where the input types are different (e.g., integer and string). If you need to handle such cases, you would need to add additional logic to the function.",
