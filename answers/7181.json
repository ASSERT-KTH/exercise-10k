  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM = (num1 * num2) / GCD\n    lcm = (num1 * num2) // gcd\n\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and returns their LCM.\n2. The GCD of the two numbers is calculated using the `math.gcd` function.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: LCM = (num1 * num2) / GCD.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_lcm` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the LCM of 12 and 15: `calculate_lcm(12, 15)` returns 60.\n* Calculate the LCM of 24 and 30: `calculate_lcm(24, 30)` returns 120.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.gcd` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can calculate the GCD using a custom implementation or a library like `numpy`.",
