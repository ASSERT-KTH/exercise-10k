  "prompt": "Given a list of integers, write a program to access and print the element at a specific index.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef print_element_at_index(lst, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the element at a specific index in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of integers.\n        index (int): The index of the element to be printed.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Check if the index is within the bounds of the list\n        if index < len(lst):\n            # Access and print the element at the specified index\n            print(f\"The element at index {index} is: {lst[index]}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Index out of range.\")\n    except TypeError:\n        print(\"Invalid input type. Please ensure that the list is a list and the index is an integer.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nindex_to_access = 2\n\nprint_element_at_index(numbers, index_to_access)\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: We define a function called `print_element_at_index` that takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `index`.\n2.  **Error Handling**: We use try-except blocks to handle potential errors, such as `IndexError` (when the index is out of range) and `TypeError` (when the input types are incorrect).\n3.  **Index Bounds Check**: We check if the provided index is within the bounds of the list. If it is, we proceed to access and print the element.\n4.  **Element Access and Printing**: We use the index to access the corresponding element in the list and print it.\n5.  **Example Usage**: We demonstrate the function's usage by creating a list of numbers and specifying an index to access. The function is then called with these inputs, and the result is printed.\n\nThis code provides a clear, step-by-step solution to accessing and printing an element at a specific index in a list, along with proper error handling and example usage.",
