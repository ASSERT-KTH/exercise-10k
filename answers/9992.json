  "answer": "**Using Constant Variables**\n\nIn programming, constant variables are used to store values that should not be changed throughout the execution of a program. Here's an example of how to use a constant variable in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define a constant variable\nPI = 3.14159  # Convention: use all uppercase letters for constant variables\n\n# Use the constant variable\nradius = 5\narea = PI * (radius ** 2)\nprint(f\"The area of the circle is {area:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n* Use all uppercase letters to define constant variables, as shown in the example above.\n* Avoid reassigning values to constant variables, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.\n* Use constant variables to store values that are unlikely to change, such as mathematical constants or configuration settings.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n* Mathematical constants: `PI`, `E`, `GRAVITY`\n* Configuration settings: `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`\n* Physical constants: `SPEED_OF_LIGHT`, `ACCELERATION_DUE_TO_GRAVITY`\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* Improves code readability by clearly indicating that a value should not be changed.\n* Reduces the risk of introducing bugs due to unintended changes to a value.\n* Enhances code maintainability by making it easier to understand the intent of the code.",
