  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and returns its square root.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the square root of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square root of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number.\")\n    \n    return math.sqrt(number)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n        result = calculate_square_root(num)\n        print(f\"The square root of {num} is {result}.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `calculate_square_root` function takes a number as input and returns its square root using the `math.sqrt` function from Python's standard library.\n*   It raises a `ValueError` if the input number is negative, as square roots of negative numbers are undefined in real mathematics.\n*   The `main` function gets user input, calls `calculate_square_root`, and prints the result.\n*   It also includes error handling to catch and display any `ValueError` exceptions that might occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   Enter a positive number (e.g., 16) to calculate its square root (4.0).\n*   Enter a negative number (e.g., -16) to see an error message indicating that the square root of a negative number cannot be calculated.\n*   Enter zero (0) to calculate its square root, which is 0.0.",
