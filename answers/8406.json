  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. Use basic algorithms to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that will solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n    \n    max_number = numbers[0]\n    \n    for number in numbers:\n        if number > max_number:\n            max_number = number\n    \n    return max_number\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34]\nprint(find_max_number(numbers))  # Output: 89\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function called `find_max_number` that takes a list of integers as an argument.\n2. **Check for Empty List**: We first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return `None` because there is no maximum number in an empty list.\n3. **Initialize Max Number**: We assume the first number in the list is the maximum number.\n4. **Iterate Over List**: We then iterate over each number in the list. If we find a number that is greater than our current maximum number, we update our maximum number.\n5. **Return Max Number**: After iterating over all numbers, we return the maximum number we found.\n6. **Test the Function**: Finally, we test our function with a sample list of numbers and print the result.\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we are potentially checking every element in the list once.\n\n### Space Complexity:\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input list, making it very space-efficient.",
