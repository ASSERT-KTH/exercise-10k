  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of strings as input and prints out the strings joined into a single string based on a delimiter.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env \n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n__author__ = 'Cristian S. Rocha'\n\ndef join_strings(delimiter, strings):\n    if delimiter == '':\n        return delimiter.join(strings)\n    else:\n        return delimiter.join(strings)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import sys\n    delimiter = sys.argv[1]\n    strings = sys.argv[2:]\n    print(join_strings(delimiter, strings))\n```\n\nThis program uses the `join` method of the string class to concatenate the strings in the `strings` list with the specified delimiter. The `join` method returns a string in which the elements of the `strings` list have been joined by the delimiter.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input strings are passed as command-line arguments. If you want to input the strings in a different way, you will need to modify the program accordingly.\n\nAlso, note that the `join` method raises a `TypeError` if the delimiter is not a string or if any of the strings in the `strings` list are not strings. If you want to handle these cases differently, you will need to add error checking code to the program.",
