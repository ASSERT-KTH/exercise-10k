  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to simulate a Twitter feed, where users can post tweets and view the timeline until they choose to quit.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that simulates a Twitter feed using a while loop:\n\n```python\nclass TwitterFeed:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.tweets = []\n\n    def post_tweet(self):\n        \"\"\"Posts a new tweet to the timeline.\"\"\"\n        tweet = input(\"Enter your tweet: \")\n        self.tweets.append(tweet)\n        print(\"Tweet posted successfully!\")\n\n    def view_timeline(self):\n        \"\"\"Displays all tweets in the timeline.\"\"\"\n        if not self.tweets:\n            print(\"No tweets in the timeline.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nTwitter Timeline:\")\n            for i, tweet in enumerate(self.tweets, start=1):\n                print(f\"{i}. {tweet}\")\n\n    def run(self):\n        \"\"\"Runs the Twitter feed simulation.\"\"\"\n        while True:\n            print(\"\\nTwitter Feed Menu:\")\n            print(\"1. Post a tweet\")\n            print(\"2. View timeline\")\n            print(\"3. Quit\")\n            choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n            if choice == \"1\":\n                self.post_tweet()\n            elif choice == \"2\":\n                self.view_timeline()\n            elif choice == \"3\":\n                print(\"Goodbye!\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    twitter_feed = TwitterFeed()\n    twitter_feed.run()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a `TwitterFeed` class that has the following methods:\n\n*   `post_tweet`: Allows users to post new tweets to the timeline.\n*   `view_timeline`: Displays all tweets in the timeline.\n*   `run`: Runs the Twitter feed simulation using a while loop.\n\nIn the `run` method:\n\n1.  The program displays a menu with options to post a tweet, view the timeline, or quit.\n2.  It prompts the user to enter their choice.\n3.  Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding method (`post_tweet`, `view_timeline`, or breaks the loop to quit).\n4.  If the user enters an invalid choice, it displays an error message and asks for input again.\n\nThe program continues to run until the user chooses to quit.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the menu prompts:\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to post a tweet. Enter your tweet and press Enter.\n3.  Choose option 2 to view the timeline. You should see the tweet you just posted.\n4.  Choose option 3 to quit the program.\n\nYou can repeat steps 2-3 as many times as you want to post and view tweets.",
