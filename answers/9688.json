  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the average temperature given a list of temperatures for each day of the week. The program should take in a list of 7 temperatures as input and output the average temperature.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_temperature(temperatures):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average temperature given a list of temperatures for each day of the week.\n\n    Args:\n        temperatures (list): A list of 7 temperatures, one for each day of the week.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average temperature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input list has 7 temperatures\n    if len(temperatures) != 7:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must have 7 temperatures\")\n\n    # Check if all temperatures are numbers\n    if not all(isinstance(temp, (int, float)) for temp in temperatures):\n        raise ValueError(\"All temperatures must be numbers\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all temperatures\n    total_temperature = sum(temperatures)\n\n    # Calculate the average temperature by dividing the sum by the number of temperatures\n    average_temperature = total_temperature / len(temperatures)\n\n    return average_temperature\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    temperatures = [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]\n    average_temp = calculate_average_temperature(temperatures)\n    print(f\"The average temperature is: {average_temp:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_average_temperature` function takes a list of temperatures as input, checks if the list has 7 temperatures and if all temperatures are numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* It calculates the sum of all temperatures using the built-in `sum` function.\n* It calculates the average temperature by dividing the sum by the number of temperatures.\n* The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_temperature` function with an example list of temperatures.\n* The average temperature is printed to the console with two decimal places using an f-string.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Always validate the input to your functions to ensure it is in the correct format.\n* Use built-in functions like `sum` to simplify your code and make it more efficient.\n* Consider using a `main` function to demonstrate how to use your functions and make your code more readable.",
