  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCD of `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n3. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the GCD.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_gcd` function with example numbers.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nThe GCD of 48 and 18 is 6\n```\n\n**Note**: This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it suitable for large inputs.",
