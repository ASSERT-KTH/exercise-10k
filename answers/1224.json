  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to let the user guess a random number between 1 and 100.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python number_guessing_game.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* The user guesses the number correctly on the first try.\n* The user guesses a number that is too low or too high, and the program provides feedback.\n* The user types \"quit\" to exit the game.",
