  "answer": "Interleaving Strings\n=====================\n\nAn interleaving of two strings is a string that contains all characters of both strings in any order, but the characters from each string must be in the same order as in the original string.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven three strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, check if `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D table where each cell `[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can be interleaved to form the first `i + j` characters of `s3`.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_interleave(s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if s3 is an interleaving of s1 and s2.\n\n    Args:\n    s1 (str): The first string.\n    s2 (str): The second string.\n    s3 (str): The third string.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if s3 is an interleaving of s1 and s2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n        return False\n\n    # Create a 2D table to store the results of subproblems\n    dp = [[False] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the base cases\n    dp[0][0] = True\n    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]\n    for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the table\n    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or (dp[i][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])\n\n    return dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"aabcc\"\ns2 = \"dbbca\"\ns3 = \"aadbbcbcac\"\nprint(is_interleave(s1, s2, s3))  # Output: True\n\ns1 = \"aabcc\"\ns2 = \"dbbca\"\ns3 = \"aadbbbaccc\"\nprint(is_interleave(s1, s2, s3))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We first check if the length of `s3` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`. If not, we return False.\n2.  We create a 2D table `dp` where each cell `[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can be interleaved to form the first `i + j` characters of `s3`.\n3.  We initialize the base cases: `dp[0][0]` is True, and `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` are True if the corresponding characters in `s1` and `s2` match the characters in `s3`.\n4.  We fill in the rest of the table using the following recurrence relation: `dp[i][j]` is True if either `dp[i - 1][j]` is True and the current character in `s1` matches the current character in `s3`, or `dp[i][j - 1]` is True and the current character in `s2` matches the current character in `s3`.\n5.  Finally, we return `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]`, which represents whether `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(len(s1) \\* len(s2)), where len(s1) and len(s2) are the lengths of the input strings `s1` and `s2`, respectively.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(len(s1) \\* len(s2)), which is the size of",
