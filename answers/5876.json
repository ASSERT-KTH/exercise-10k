  "answer": "**Character Frequency Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a string, calculate the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using a Python dictionary to store the frequency of each character.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency_dict = calculate_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_character_frequency` that takes an input string as an argument.\n2. We create an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the frequency of each character.\n3. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. If the character is already in the dictionary, we increment its frequency by 1. Otherwise, we add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n5. We return the dictionary containing the character frequencies.\n6. In the `main` function, we test the `calculate_character_frequency` function with a sample input string and print the character frequencies.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nInput: \"Hello, World!\"\nOutput:\n```\nCharacter Frequency:\nH: 1\ne: 1\nl: 3\no: 2\n,: 1\n : 1\nW: 1\nr: 1\nd: 1\n!: 1\n```\nNote that this solution is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want to ignore case, spaces, or punctuation, you can modify the input string accordingly before calculating the character frequencies.",
