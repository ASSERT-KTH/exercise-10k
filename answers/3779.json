  "prompt": "Unpivot a dictionary from columns to rows.",
  "answer": "Unpivoting a dictionary from columns to rows can be achieved by using Python with its built-in data structures and libraries. For this task, we'll assume you have a dictionary where each key represents a column name and its corresponding value is a list representing the column values.\n\nHere's how you can unpivot such a dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef unpivot_dict(data_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Unpivots a dictionary from columns to rows.\n    \n    :param data_dict: A dictionary where keys are column names and values are lists of column values.\n    :return: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with column names as keys.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the column names\n    columns = list(data_dict.keys())\n    \n    # Find the maximum length of values among all columns to handle uneven columns\n    max_length = max(len(values) for values in data_dict.values())\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the unpivoted rows\n    unpivoted_rows = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the range of the maximum length\n    for i in range(max_length):\n        row = {}\n        # For each column, try to get the value at the current index\n        for column in columns:\n            # If the list of values for this column is long enough, add the value to the row\n            if i < len(data_dict[column]):\n                row[column] = data_dict[column][i]\n            # If not, you might want to add a default value (e.g., None) depending on your needs\n            else:\n                row[column] = None\n        # Add the row to the list of unpivoted rows\n        unpivoted_rows.append(row)\n    \n    return unpivoted_rows\n\n# Example usage\ndata_dict = {\n    'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'],\n    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],  # Demonstrating uneven columns\n    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']\n}\n\nunpivoted = unpivot_dict(data_dict)\nfor row in unpivoted:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `unpivot_dict` that takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the unpivoted data structure. It handles the case where columns have different lengths by filling missing values with `None`. You can adjust the handling of missing values based on your specific requirements.\n\nWhen you run this script with the provided example dictionary, it will print out each row of the unpivoted data.",
