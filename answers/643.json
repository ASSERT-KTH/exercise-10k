  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a single line of input from the user and checks if it contains only digits. If it does, print 'Valid'. Otherwise, print 'Invalid'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport sys\n\ndef check_line(line):\n    if line.isdigit():\n        return 'Valid'\n    else:\n        return 'Invalid'\n\nline = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nprint(check_line(line))\n```\nNote that I've used the `strip()` method to remove the newline character from the input line, as specified in the requirements. I've also used the `isdigit()` method to check if the line contains only digits, as specified in the `check_line()` function.",
