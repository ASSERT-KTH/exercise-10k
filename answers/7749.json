  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer score as input and evaluates it based on the following conditions: if the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'; if the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'; if the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'; if the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), the grade is 'D'; and if the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'. The program should output the corresponding grade for the given score.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a dictionary to map score ranges to grades\ngrades = {\n    'A': lambda score: score >= 90,\n    'B': lambda score: 80 <= score <= 89,\n    'C': lambda score: 70 <= score <= 79,\n    'D': lambda score: 60 <= score <= 69,\n    'F': lambda score: score < 60\n}\n\n# Define a function to evaluate a score and return the corresponding grade\ndef evaluate_grade(score):\n    for grade, condition in grades.items():\n        if condition(score):\n            return grade\n\n# Define a main function to test the evaluate_grade function\ndef main():\n    score = 75\n    grade = evaluate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")\n\n# Call the main function to test the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `grades` dictionary, the `evaluate_grade` function, and the `main` function as specified. The `main` function tests the `evaluate_grade` function with a sample score of 75 and prints the result.",
