  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function to check if two given strings are anagrams of each other, providing a clear plan and explanation to help you understand the solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n    \n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string to be compared.\n        str2 (str): The second string to be compared.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we convert both strings to lower case to make the comparison case-insensitive\n    str1 = str1.lower()\n    \n    # We do the same for the second string\n    str2 = str2.lower()\n    \n    # We remove any spaces from both strings, as anagrams typically do not consider spaces\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    \n    # We do the same for the second string\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    \n    # We check if the sorted versions of both strings are equal\n    # If they are, then the original strings are anagrams of each other\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # Should return True\nprint(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # Should return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `are_anagrams` first converts both input strings `str1` and `str2` to lower case using the `lower()` method to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n* It then removes any spaces from both strings using the `replace()` method, as anagrams typically do not consider spaces.\n* The function checks if the sorted versions of both strings are equal by using the `sorted()` function, which returns `True` if the original strings are anagrams of each other and `False` otherwise.\n* Finally, the function is tested with example strings to demonstrate its usage and correctness.",
