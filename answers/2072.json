  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that checks if a given number is prime or not.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Check if the number is prime\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If it is, then `n` is not prime, and the function returns `False`.\n4. If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it's prime, and the function returns `True`.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `is_prime` function.\n6. The result is printed to the console.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: `25`\n  Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23`\n  Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `37`\n  Output: `37 is a prime number.`\n\nNote: This program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small inputs. For larger inputs, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
