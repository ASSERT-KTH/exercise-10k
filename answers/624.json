  "answer": "**Meal Cost Calculator with Tip**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip given the cost of the meal and the tip percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a meal including a tip.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal including the tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n    print(f\"Total cost of the meal including a {tip_percentage}% tip: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal when prompted (e.g., `20.00`).\n3. Enter the tip percentage when prompted (e.g., `15`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the total cost of the meal including the tip.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate_total_cost` function takes in the meal cost and tip percentage as arguments and returns the total cost.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_total_cost` function, and displays the result.\n* The tip amount is calculated by multiplying the meal cost by the tip percentage divided by 100.\n* The total cost is calculated by adding the meal cost and the tip amount.\n* The result is displayed with two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.",
