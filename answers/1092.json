  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the speed and time of travel as input and outputs the distance traveled.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time of travel.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(speed, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance traveled given the speed and time of travel.\n\n    Args:\n        speed (float): Speed of travel in km/h.\n        time (float): Time of travel in hours.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance traveled in kilometers.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = speed * time\n    return distance\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Take user input for speed and time of travel\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed of travel in km/h: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time of travel in hours: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the distance traveled\n    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)\n    print(f\"The distance traveled is {distance} kilometers.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example `distance_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program using Python, for example `python distance_calculator.py`.\n4. Enter the speed and time of travel when prompted.\n5. The program will display the calculated distance traveled.\n\n### Example Usage\n```\nEnter the speed of travel in km/h: 50\nEnter the time of travel in hours: 2\nThe distance traveled is 100.0 kilometers.\n```",
