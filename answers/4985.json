  "prompt": "Given two floating point numbers 3.5 and 2.7, calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient.",
  "answer": "## Step 1: Calculate the sum of the two numbers\nTo find the sum, we simply add the two numbers together: sum = 3.5 + 2.7.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the difference of the two numbers\nTo find the difference, we subtract the second number from the first: difference = 3.5 - 2.7.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the two numbers\nTo find the product, we multiply the two numbers together: product = 3.5 * 2.7.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the quotient of the two numbers\nTo find the quotient, we divide the first number by the second: quotient = 3.5 / 2.7.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the actual calculations for each operation\n- Sum: 3.5 + 2.7 = 6.2\n- Difference: 3.5 - 2.7 = 0.8\n- Product: 3.5 * 2.7 = 9.45\n- Quotient: 3.5 / 2.7 = 1.2963 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2, 0.8, 9.45, 1.2963}$",
