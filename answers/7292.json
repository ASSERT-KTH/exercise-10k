  "answer": "### Calculating Total Cost with Tip\n#### Function Description\n\nThe `calculate_total_with_tip` function calculates the total cost of a meal including a tip. It takes two arguments: the total cost of the meal and the tip percentage.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_with_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a meal including a tip.\n\n    Args:\n        total_cost (float): The total cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost with the tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * total_cost\n    \n    # Calculate the total cost with the tip\n    total_with_tip = total_cost + tip_amount\n    \n    return total_with_tip\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    total_cost = 100.0\n    tip_percentage = 15.0\n    \n    total_with_tip = calculate_total_with_tip(total_cost, tip_percentage)\n    \n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip percentage: {tip_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Total with tip: ${total_with_tip:.2f}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `total_cost` and `tip_percentage`.\n2. It calculates the tip amount by multiplying the total cost by the tip percentage divided by 100.\n3. It calculates the total cost with the tip by adding the tip amount to the total cost.\n4. The function returns the total cost with the tip.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_total_with_tip` function. We calculate the total cost with a 15% tip for a meal that costs $100.00. The output will be:\n\n```\nTotal cost: $100.00\nTip percentage: 15.0%\nTotal with tip: $115.00\n```",
