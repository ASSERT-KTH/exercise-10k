  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_substring(string, substring):\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(string):\n        if string[index:index + len(substring)] == substring:\n            return index\n        index += 1\n    return -1\n\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    substring = \"World\"\n    print(find_substring(string, substring))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the `find_substring` function, which takes a `string` and a `substring` as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the `substring` in the `string`. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the `string` and checks each substring of the same length as the `substring` to see if it matches. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the match. If no match is found, the function returns -1.\n\nThe `main` function calls the `find_substring` function with the specified `string` and `substring` and prints the result.\n\nNote that this code uses the `len` function to get the length of the `string` and the `substring`, and it uses slicing to extract substrings from the `string`. It also uses the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.",
