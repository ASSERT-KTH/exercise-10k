  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing grade of 60. Use conditional statements to determine the outcome.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int grade;\n\n    printf(\"Enter your grade: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &grade);\n\n    if (grade >= 60) {\n        printf(\"You passed\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"You failed\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've written the code in C, as it's a common language used in introductory programming courses. The code includes the necessary `#include` directive, defines the `main` function, and implements the program logic as described in the specification.",
