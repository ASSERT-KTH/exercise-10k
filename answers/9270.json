  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The program should use a basic algorithm to reverse the string, such as iterating over the input string from the end to the start.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    reversed = ''\n    length = len(s)\n    for index in range(length):\n        reversed += s[length - 1 - index]\n    return reversed\n\ns = \"Hello World\"\nprint(reverse_string(s))\n```\nThis code defines a function `reverse_string` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the reversed string. It uses a loop to iterate over the input string from the end to the start, adding each character to a new string `reversed`. The function is then called with the input string `\"Hello World\"` and the reversed string is printed to the console.",
