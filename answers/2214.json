  "prompt": "Write a program that responds to basic user inputs. Print a greeting message when the user types 'hello', print a farewell message when the user types 'bye', and print 'I didn't understand that' for any other input.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Please enter a message: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == \"hello\":\n            print(\"Hello! It's nice to meet you.\")\n        elif user_input.lower() == \"bye\":\n            print(\"Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"I didn't understand that.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nLet me explain how this program works:\n\n1. The `while True` loop runs indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement.\n2. The `input` function is used to get user input, which is stored in the `user_input` variable.\n3. The `if-elif-else` statement checks the user input. If the input is \"hello\" (case-insensitive), it prints a greeting message.\n4. If the input is \"bye\" (case-insensitive), it prints a farewell message and then breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.\n5. For any other input, it prints \"I didn't understand that.\"\n6. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `chatbot.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python chatbot.py`) to test it out.",
