  "prompt": "Write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year, using conditional statements to check the year's divisibility",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int year;\n    printf(\"Enter a year: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &year);\n\n    if (year % 4 == 0) {\n        if (year % 100 == 0) {\n            if (year % 400 == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d is a leap year.\\n\", year);\n            } else {\n                printf(\"%d is not a leap year.\\n\", year);\n            }\n        } else {\n            printf(\"%d is a leap year.\\n\", year);\n        }\n    } else {\n        printf(\"%d is not a leap year.\\n\", year);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary library, declares the `main` function, and includes the necessary code to determine whether a given year is a leap year. It follows the logic described in the specification and uses nested `if` statements to check the divisibility of the year by 4, 100, and 400.",
