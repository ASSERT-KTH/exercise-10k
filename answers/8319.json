The program initializes an empty dictionary `student_grades` to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.\n2.  It defines five functions:\n\n    *   `add_student_grade()`: Adds a student grade to the dictionary.\n    *   `remove_student_grade()`: Removes a student grade from the dictionary.\n    *   `update_student_grade()`: Updates a student grade in the dictionary.\n    *   `display_student_grades()`: Displays all student grades.\n    *   `calculate_average_grade()`: Calculates the average student grade.\n3.  The `main()` function serves as the program's entry point, presenting a menu for users to interact with the program.\n4.  Users can choose to add, remove, update, display, or calculate the average of student grades. They can also exit the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display a menu with options to add, remove, update, display, or calculate the average of student grades. Here's an example of how you can use the program:\n\n1.  Run the program and choose option 1 to add a student grade.\n2.  Enter the student's name and grade when prompted.\n3.  Choose option 4 to display all student grades.\n4.  Choose option 5 to calculate the average student grade.\n5.  Choose option 6 to exit the program.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use the program to manage student grades.",
