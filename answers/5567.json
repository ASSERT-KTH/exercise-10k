  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a name and age as input and outputs a personalized greeting with the name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print a personalized greeting.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function is used to get the user's name and age.\n   - It uses the built-in `input` function to get the user's name and age.\n   - It includes a `try-except` block to handle invalid inputs for age (e.g., non-numeric characters).\n2. The `print_greeting` function is used to print a personalized greeting.\n   - It uses f-string formatting to include the user's name and age in the greeting.\n3. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.\n   - It calls the `get_user_info` function to get the user's name and age.\n   - It then calls the `print_greeting` function to print the personalized greeting.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `greeting.py`) and run it from the command line with Python (e.g., `python greeting.py`). The program will prompt you to enter your name and age, and then it will print a personalized greeting. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```",
