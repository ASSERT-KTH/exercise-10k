  "answer": "### Anonymous Function to Square a Number\n\nHere's an example of an anonymous function in Python that squares a number and applies it to a list of numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Use a lambda function (anonymous function) to square each number\nsquared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(squared_numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a list of numbers `numbers`.\n*   We use the `map()` function to apply the lambda function to each number in the list.\n*   The lambda function `lambda x: x ** 2` takes a number `x` and returns its square (`x` squared).\n*   The `list()` function is used to convert the map object to a list, which is then assigned to `squared_numbers`.\n*   Finally, we print the resulting list of squared numbers.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]\nprint(squared_numbers)\n```\n\nThis will also output: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`",
