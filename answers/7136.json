  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. The program should take an integer grade as input and print 'Pass' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Fail' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user for their grade\n    grade = int(input(\"Enter your grade: \"))\n\n    # Check if the grade is 50 or above\n    if grade >= 50:\n        print(\"Pass\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Fail\")\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code does exactly what the specifications describe. It defines a `main` function that prompts the user for their grade, checks if the grade is 50 or above, and prints \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" accordingly. The `main` function is then called to start the program.",
