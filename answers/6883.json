  "answer": "**Bank Transaction System Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a bank transaction system. It asks for the user's current balance and the amount they want to withdraw or deposit, and updates the balance accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef get_float_input(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Gets a float input from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            return float(input(prompt))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\ndef bank_transaction_system():\n    \"\"\"Simulates a bank transaction system.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Bank Transaction System\")\n\n    # Get the user's current balance\n    balance = get_float_input(\"Enter your current balance: \")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user if they want to withdraw or deposit\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"2. Deposit\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            # Withdrawal\n            amount = get_float_input(\"Enter the amount you want to withdraw: \")\n            if amount > balance:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds. Withdrawal not possible.\")\n            else:\n                balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {balance:.2f}\")\n\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            # Deposit\n            amount = get_float_input(\"Enter the amount you want to deposit: \")\n            balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposit successful. New balance: {balance:.2f}\")\n\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            # Check Balance\n            print(f\"Current balance: {balance:.2f}\")\n\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            # Exit\n            print(\"Thank you for using the Bank Transaction System. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    bank_transaction_system()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program and enter your current balance when prompted.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Withdraw: Enter the amount you want to withdraw. If the amount exceeds your balance, the program will display an \"Insufficient funds\" message.\n\t* Deposit: Enter the amount you want to deposit. The program will update your balance accordingly.\n\t* Check Balance: View your current balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat steps 2 until you choose to exit.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not store user data or perform any error checking beyond ensuring that the input is a valid number. In a real-world application, you would want to add more robust error handling and security measures.",
