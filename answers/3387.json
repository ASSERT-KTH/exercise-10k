  "answer": "**Merging Two Sorted Lists**\n=====================================\n\nHere's an example of a function that merges two sorted lists into one sorted list. This function uses a two-pointer technique to compare elements from both lists and append the smaller one to the result list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first sorted list.\n        list2 (list): The second sorted list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new sorted list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n\n    # Compare elements from both lists and append the smaller one to the result list\n    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\n        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n            result.append(list1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(list2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # Append any remaining elements from both lists\n    result.extend(list1[i:])\n    result.extend(list2[j:])\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nlist1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nlist2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\nprint(merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the beginning of both lists.\n2.  Compare the elements at the current positions of both lists.\n3.  If the element from the first list is smaller, append it to the result list and increment the `i` pointer. Otherwise, append the element from the second list and increment the `j` pointer.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until one of the lists is exhausted.\n5.  Append any remaining elements from both lists to the result list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists. This is because we're iterating through both lists once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n + m), as we're creating a new list to store the merged result.",
