  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that combines two lists into a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists. This function will utilize a built-in Python function to achieve the desired output. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef combine_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing tuples.\n    Each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.\n    \n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first input list.\n        list2 (list): The second input list.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be lists.\")\n\n    # We use the built-in zip function in Python, which makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.\n    # The zip function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.\n    # We convert the result to a list, because the problem requires a list as output.\n    combined_list = list(zip(list1, list2))\n    \n    # Finally, we return the combined list.\n    return combined_list\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nprint(combine_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `combine_lists` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and first checks if both are indeed lists. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It uses the built-in `zip` function to create an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the input lists. The `zip` function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.\n* The result from `zip` is converted to a list using the `list` function and stored in `combined_list`.\n* Finally, the function returns `combined_list`, which contains tuples with one element from each of the input lists.",
