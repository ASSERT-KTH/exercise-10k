  "answer": "Here's a Python program that demonstrates the use of boolean expressions, including logical operators and conditional statements, using variables:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nx = 5\ny = 10\nz = 15\n\n# Boolean expressions\nprint(\"Boolean expressions:\")\nprint(x > y)  # False\nprint(x < y)  # True\nprint(x == y)  # False\nprint(x != y)  # True\n\n# Logical operators\nprint(\"\\nLogical operators:\")\nprint(x > y and x < z)  # False\nprint(x > y or x < z)  # True\nprint(not x > y)  # True\n\n# Conditional statements\nprint(\"\\nConditional statements:\")\nif x > y:\n    print(\"x is greater than y\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to y\")\n\nif x < y and y < z:\n    print(\"x is less than y and y is less than z\")\nelif x < y or y < z:\n    print(\"x is less than y or y is less than z\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Neither condition is true\")\n\n# Example usage\nage = 25\nhas_driver_license = True\nhas_car_insurance = False\n\nif age >= 18 and has_driver_license and has_car_insurance:\n    print(\"\\nYou are eligible to drive.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nYou are not eligible to drive.\")\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of boolean expressions, logical operators, and conditional statements using variables. It covers various scenarios and provides a clear understanding of how these concepts work together in a programming context.",
