  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array and two indices as input, and returns a slice of the array from the first index to the second index.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef slice_array(arr, start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a slice of the input array from the start index to the end index.\n\n    Args:\n        arr: The input array.\n        start: The starting index of the slice.\n        end: The ending index of the slice.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new array that is a slice of the input array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return arr[start:end]\n```\nI've implemented the `slice_array` function exactly as described in the specification. It takes three arguments: `arr`, `start`, and `end`, and returns a slice of `arr` from `start` to `end` using the `arr[start:end]` syntax. The docstring explains the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value.",
