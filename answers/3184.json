  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a year as input and uses if/else statements to determine if it's a leap year.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, \n    except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. \n    This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if year % 4 == 0:  # If the year is evenly divisible by 4\n        if year % 100 == 0:  # Unless it's a century year\n            if year % 400 == 0:  # Unless it's evenly divisible by 400\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if a year is a leap year.\n2. It first checks if the year is evenly divisible by 4.\n3. If it is, it then checks if the year is a century year (i.e., evenly divisible by 100).\n4. If it's a century year, it must also be evenly divisible by 400 to be a leap year.\n5. The `main` function gets a year from the user and checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function.\n6. It then prints whether the year is a leap year or not. \n\n### Example Use Cases\n- Input: `2000`\n  Output: `2000 is a leap year.`\n- Input: `1900`\n  Output: `1900 is not a leap year.`\n- Input: `2020`\n  Output: `2020 is a leap year.`",
