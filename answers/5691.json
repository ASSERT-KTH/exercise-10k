  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a number as input and checks if it's positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef check_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.\n\n    Args:\n    num (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num > 0:\n        return \"The number is positive.\"\n    elif num < 0:\n        return \"The number is negative.\"\n    else:\n        return \"The number is zero.\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number from the user\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Check the number\n    result = check_number(num)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_number` function takes an integer `num` as input and returns a string indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.\n*   Inside the function, we use conditional statements (`if` and `elif`) to check the value of `num`.\n*   If `num` is greater than 0, we return the string \"The number is positive.\" If `num` is less than 0, we return \"The number is negative.\"\n*   If `num` is neither greater than nor less than 0 (i.e., it's equal to 0), we return \"The number is zero.\"\n*   In the `main` function, we get a number from the user, check it using the `check_number` function, and then print the result.\n*   We use `float(input(...))` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers. If you only want to accept integers, you can use `int(input(...))`.",
