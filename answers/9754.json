  "answer": "**Calculating the Area of a Triangle**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides or its base and height.\n\n### Method 1: Using Base and Height\n\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area_base_height(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (base * height) / 2\n\n# Example usage:\nbase = 5\nheight = 6\narea = calculate_area_base_height(base, height)\nprint(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area}\")\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Heron's Formula (Given Three Sides)\n\nIf you have the lengths of all three sides of the triangle, you can use Heron's formula to calculate the area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_area_heron(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides using Heron's formula.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The length of side a.\n        b (float): The length of side b.\n        c (float): The length of side c.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\na = 3\nb = 4\nc = 5\narea = calculate_area_heron(a, b, c)\nprint(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area}\")\n```\n\n### Choosing the Right Method\n\n- Use the `calculate_area_base_height` function if you know the base and height of the triangle.\n- Use the `calculate_area_heron` function if you know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle.\n\nRemember, for Heron's formula to be applicable, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.",
