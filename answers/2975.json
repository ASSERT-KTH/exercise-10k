  "answer": "**Coin Change Problem**\n=========================\n\nThe coin change problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the target amount.\n\n**Code Solution**\n-----------------\n\nHere is a Python solution using dynamic programming:\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        coins (list): A list of coin denominations.\n        amount (int): The target amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make 0 amount\n\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n# Example usage:\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)\n```\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. We create a table `dp` of size `amount + 1` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to `amount`.\n2. We initialize the first element of the table `dp[0]` to 0, since we need 0 coins to make 0 amount.\n3. We iterate over each coin denomination and for each coin, we iterate over the range of amounts from `coin` to `amount`.\n4. For each amount `i`, we update the minimum number of coins needed by taking the minimum of the current value `dp[i]` and the value of `dp[i - coin] + 1`. This represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the current amount `i` by either using the current coin or not using it.\n5. Finally, we return the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount `amount`. If no combination of coins can make the target amount, we return -1.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where `amount` is the target amount and `len(coins)` is the number of coin denominations.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(amount), where `amount` is the target amount. We need to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to `amount`.",
