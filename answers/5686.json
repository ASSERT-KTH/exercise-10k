  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that checks if a password is valid based on certain conditions.\n\n```python\ndef check_password(password):\n    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        print(\"Password should be at least 8 characters long.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\n        print(\"Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):\n        print(\"Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one digit\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n        print(\"Password should contain at least one digit.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if password contains at least one special character\n    special_chars = \"!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:'<>,./?\"\n    if not any(char in special_chars for char in password):\n        print(\"Password should contain at least one special character.\")\n        return False\n\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n    check_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program checks for the following conditions:\n1. The password should be at least 8 characters long.\n2. The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\n3. The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\n4. The password should contain at least one digit.\n5. The password should contain at least one special character.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, it prints an error message and returns `False`. If all conditions are met, it prints \"Password is valid.\" and returns `True`.",
