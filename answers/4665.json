  "answer": "**Subsequence Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given string is a subsequence of another string.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if s1 is a subsequence of s2.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The potential subsequence string.\n        s2 (str): The original string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s1 is a subsequence of s2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < len(s1) and j < len(s2):\n        if s1[i] == s2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        j += 1\n    return i == len(s1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    s1 = \"abc\"\n    s2 = \"ahbgdc\"\n    print(f\"Is '{s1}' a subsequence of '{s2}'? {is_subsequence(s1, s2)}\")\n\n    s1 = \"axc\"\n    s2 = \"ahbgdc\"\n    print(f\"Is '{s1}' a subsequence of '{s2}'? {is_subsequence(s1, s2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_subsequence` function takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.\n2. It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.\n3. It iterates through `s2` using the `j` pointer.\n4. If the characters at the current positions of `s1` and `s2` match, it increments the `i` pointer to move to the next character in `s1`.\n5. If the loop completes and `i` has reached the end of `s1`, it means all characters in `s1` have been found in `s2` in the correct order, so it returns `True`.\n6. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Checking if a DNA sequence is a subsequence of a larger genome.\n* Validating if a given string is a subsequence of a text document.\n* Determining if a sequence of events is a subsequence of a larger event log.",
