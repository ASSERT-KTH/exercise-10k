  "answer": "Here's an implementation of the merge sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    # If the array has only one element, it is already sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    # Find the middle of the array\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    \n    # Divide the array into two halves\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n    \n    # Recursively sort the two halves\n    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n    \n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in the left or right halves, append them\n    while left_index < len(left):\n        merged.append(left[left_index])\n        left_index += 1\n    \n    while right_index < len(right):\n        merged.append(right[right_index])\n        right_index += 1\n    \n    return merged\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Base Case**: The `merge_sort` function checks if the input array has one or zero elements. If it does, the function returns the array as it is already sorted.\n2. **Divide**: The array is divided into two halves, `left_half` and `right_half`, using the `mid` index.\n3. **Conquer**: The `merge_sort` function is recursively called on `left_half` and `right_half` to sort them individually.\n4. **Combine**: The `merge` function is used to merge the sorted `left_half` and `right_half` into a single sorted array.\n5. **Merge**: The `merge` function compares elements from `left` and `right` and appends the smaller element to the `merged` array. This process continues until all elements from both halves are merged.\n6. **Example Usage**: The `merge_sort` function is called with an example array, and the sorted array is printed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* Best-case: O(n log n)\n* Average-case: O(n log n)\n* Worst-case: O(n log n)\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n* O(n) for the recursive call stack and the temporary arrays used during merging.",
