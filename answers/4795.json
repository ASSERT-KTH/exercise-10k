  "answer": "**Unscramble Word Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random scrambled word and asks the user to unscramble it. The user's answer is then checked against the original word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\", \"fig\", \"grape\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scrambles a given word\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    original_word = random.choice(words)\n    \n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(original_word)\n    \n    # Ask the user to unscramble the word\n    print(\"Unscramble the word: \", scrambled_word)\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n    \n    # Check the user's answer\n    if user_answer.lower() == original_word:\n        print(\"Correct! The unscrambled word is indeed\", original_word)\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is\", original_word)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a scrambled word and ask you to unscramble it.\n3. Enter your answer when prompted.\n4. The program will then tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a predefined list of words. You can add or remove words from this list as needed.\n* The `scramble_word` function uses the `random.shuffle` function to scramble the word.\n* The `main` function chooses a random word, scrambles it, and asks the user to unscramble it. It then checks the user's answer and provides feedback.",
