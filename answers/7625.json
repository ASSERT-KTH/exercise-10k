  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to simulate a game of Tic Tac Toe between the user and the computer.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game is played between a user (X) and the computer (O). The computer's moves are chosen randomly.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]}\")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]}\")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]}\")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combo[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Make a random move for the computer.\"\"\"\n    possible_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    move = random.choice(possible_moves)\n    board[move] = \"O\"\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move(board)\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a while loop to keep the game running until either the user or the computer wins, or until the board is full (a tie). The user is asked to enter their move (1-9), and the computer makes a random move after the user's turn. The `check_win` function checks if there is a winner after each move.",
