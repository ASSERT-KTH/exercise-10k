  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a given list of integers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position\n    lengths = [1] * len(sequence)\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        # Compare the current element with all previous elements\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If the current element is greater than the previous element, update the length\n            if sequence[i] > sequence[j]:\n                lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], lengths[j] + 1)\n\n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max(lengths)\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    sequence = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]\n    print(\"Length of the longest increasing subsequence:\", longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize a list `lengths` to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position, with all values set to 1 (since a single element is an increasing subsequence of length 1).\n2.  Iterate through the input sequence. For each element, compare it with all previous elements.\n3.  If the current element is greater than a previous element, update the length of the LIS ending at the current position if a longer subsequence is found.\n4.  After iterating through the entire sequence, return the maximum length found in the `lengths` list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input sequence. This is because we have two nested loops: one iterating through the sequence and another comparing each element with all previous elements.",
