  "answer": "Variance Calculation\n=====================\n\nThe variance of a list of numbers is a measure of how spread out the numbers are from their mean value.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe variance can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = \u03a3(xi - \u03bc)\u00b2 / (n - 1)\n\nwhere:\n\n* \u03c3\u00b2 is the variance\n* xi is each individual number in the list\n* \u03bc is the mean of the list\n* n is the number of elements in the list\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean of the list\n    mean = np.mean(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the variance using the formula\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n    \n    return variance\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvariance = calculate_variance(numbers)\nprint(\"Variance:\", variance)\n```\n\n### Using NumPy Library\n\nIf you're working with large datasets, it's more efficient to use the `numpy` library, which provides a built-in function to calculate the variance:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers using NumPy.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.var(numbers, ddof=1)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvariance = calculate_variance(numbers)\nprint(\"Variance:\", variance)\n```\n\nIn this example, `ddof=1` stands for \"delta degrees of freedom\" and is set to 1 to calculate the sample variance (i.e., the variance of a sample of a population). If you want to calculate the population variance, you can set `ddof=0`.",
