  "answer": "**Printing Tuple Elements using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a for loop to print each element of a given tuple.\n\n```python\ndef print_tuple_elements(tuple_to_print):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints each element of a given tuple.\n\n    Args:\n        tuple_to_print (tuple): The tuple to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for element in tuple_to_print:\n        print(element)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a tuple\n    example_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n    \n    # Print the tuple elements\n    print(\"Elements of the tuple:\")\n    print_tuple_elements(example_tuple)\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The `print_tuple_elements` function takes a tuple as an argument.\n2. A for loop is used to iterate over each element in the tuple.\n3. Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to print each element.\n4. In the `main` section, an example tuple is created and passed to the `print_tuple_elements` function to demonstrate its usage.\n\n**Running the Code:**\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print each element of the `example_tuple` on a separate line:\n\n```\nElements of the tuple:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
