  "prompt": "You are given a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades in different subjects. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has no grades, print 'No grades available'.",
  "answer": "### Student Average Grade Calculator\n#### Program Description\nThis program calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary and prints out the student's name along with their average grade.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(student_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student.\n\n    Args:\n    student_grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades in different subjects.\n\n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    for student, grades in student_grades.items():\n        if not grades:\n            print(f\"{student}: No grades available\")\n        else:\n            average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n            print(f\"{student}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    student_grades = {\n        \"John\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 90, \"English\": 78},\n        \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 92, \"Science\": 88, \"English\": 95},\n        \"Bob\": {},\n        \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 76, \"Science\": 85, \"English\": 90}\n    }\n\n    calculate_average_grade(student_grades)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function iterates over each student in the `student_grades` dictionary.\n2. For each student, it checks if the student has any grades. If not, it prints 'No grades available'.\n3. If the student has grades, it calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n4. The average grade is then printed out with two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.\n5. In the `main` function, an example `student_grades` dictionary is provided to demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_average_grade` function.\n\n#### Example Output\n```\nJohn: 84.33\nAlice: 91.67\nBob: No grades available\nCharlie: 83.67\n```",
