  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a game show, allowing contestants to answer questions and win prizes using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that simulates a game show:\n```python\n# Game Show Simulator\n\n# Import the random module to generate random questions\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with questions, answers, and prizes\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\"A\": \"Paris\", \"B\": \"London\", \"C\": \"Berlin\", \"D\": \"Rome\", \"correct\": \"A\"},\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"B\": \"Michelangelo\", \"C\": \"Raphael\", \"D\": \"Caravaggio\", \"correct\": \"A\"},\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\"A\": \"Earth\", \"B\": \"Saturn\", \"C\": \"Jupiter\", \"D\": \"Uranus\", \"correct\": \"C\"},\n}\n\n# Define a function to play the game\ndef play_game():\n    # Initialize the player's score and prize\n    score = 0\n    prize = 0\n\n    # Loop through each question\n    for question, answers in questions.items():\n        # Print the question and answers\n        print(question)\n        for option, answer in answers.items():\n            if option != \"correct\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {answer}\")\n\n        # Get the player's answer\n        player_answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n\n        # Check if the player's answer is correct\n        if player_answer.upper() == answers[\"correct\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n            # Increase the prize amount\n            prize += 1000\n            print(f\"You've won ${prize} so far!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {answers[answers['correct']]}\")\n            print(f\"You've won ${prize} so far!\")\n\n    # Print the final score and prize\n    print(f\"Game over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n    print(f\"Congratulations, you've won a total of ${prize}!\")\n\n# Call the play_game function to start the game\nplay_game()\n```\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `questions` with questions, answers, and prizes.\n2. The `play_game` function initializes the player's score and prize, then loops through each question.\n3. For each question, the program prints the question and answers, gets the player's answer, and checks if it's correct.\n4. If the player's answer is correct, the program increases the score and prize amount.\n5. After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score and prize.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and play the game to test your knowledge and win prizes.\n* Modify the `questions` dictionary to add or remove questions, or change the answers and prizes.\n* Use the program as a template to create your own game show simulator with different questions and rules.",
