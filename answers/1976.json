  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. This will involve creating a function that takes a list as an argument and returns the sorted list. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying it in-place\n    numbers_copy = numbers.copy()\n    \n    # Get the length of the list to use in our loop\n    n = len(numbers_copy)\n    \n    # We need to repeat the process of comparing and swapping adjacent elements for n-1 passes\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        \n        # In each pass, we compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order\n        for j in range(n-i-1):\n            \n            # If the current element is greater than the next one, swap them\n            if numbers_copy[j] > numbers_copy[j+1]:\n                \n                # Swap the elements by using a temporary variable\n                temp = numbers_copy[j]\n                numbers_copy[j] = numbers_copy[j+1]\n                numbers_copy[j+1] = temp\n                \n    # After the loop finishes, the list is sorted, so we return it\n    return numbers_copy\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", bubble_sort(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `bubble_sort` function starts by creating a copy of the input list `numbers` to avoid modifying it in-place. This is done using the `copy()` method, which returns a shallow copy of the list.\n*   The function then iterates over the list `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the list. In each iteration, it compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n*   The swapping of elements is done using a temporary variable `temp`. This variable is used to hold the value of the current element while the current element is replaced with the next element, and then the next element is replaced with the value held in `temp`.\n*   Finally, after the loop finishes, the list is sorted, and the function returns the sorted list `numbers_copy`.",
