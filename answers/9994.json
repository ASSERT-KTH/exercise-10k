  "answer": "**Immutable Variables**\n=======================\n\nIn programming, an immutable variable is a variable that cannot be changed once it is assigned a value. This is useful when you want to store a value that should not be modified.\n\n### Example in Python\n\nPython has a built-in `tuple` data type that is immutable. You can also use the `final` keyword in Python 3.8 and later to create an immutable variable.\n\n```python\n# Using tuple\nMY_CONSTANT = (1, 2, 3)\ntry:\n    MY_CONSTANT[0] = 10  # This will raise an error\nexcept TypeError:\n    print(\"Tuples are immutable\")\n\n# Using final keyword\nfrom typing import Final\nMY_CONSTANT: Final = 10\ntry:\n    MY_CONSTANT = 20  # This will raise an error\nexcept AttributeError:\n    print(\"Final variables are immutable\")\n```\n\n### Example in Java\n\nIn Java, you can use the `final` keyword to declare an immutable variable.\n\n```java\npublic class ImmutableVariable {\n    public static final int MY_CONSTANT = 10;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            MY_CONSTANT = 20;  // This will raise an error\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Final variables are immutable\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Example in C#\n\nIn C#, you can use the `const` keyword to declare an immutable variable.\n\n```csharp\npublic class ImmutableVariable {\n    public const int MY_CONSTANT = 10;\n\n    public static void Main(string[] args) {\n        try {\n            // This will raise a compile-time error\n            // MY_CONSTANT = 20;\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Const variables are immutable\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* Use immutable variables to store values that should not be changed, such as constants or configuration values.\n* Use immutable data structures, such as tuples or frozen sets, to store collections of values that should not be modified.\n* Avoid using mutable variables to store values that should not be changed, as this can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.",
