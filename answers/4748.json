  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Euclidean Distance Formula\n\nThe Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D plane is given by:\n\n\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\n### Python Program\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n    \n    Args:\n    point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n    point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It extracts the x and y coordinates from the tuples.\n3. It applies the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n5. The result is printed to the console with two decimal places of precision.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). You should see the output:\n\n```\nThe distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) is 5.00 units.\n```",
