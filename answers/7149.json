  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\n# Get the student's score\nscore = float(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n# Determine the grade\nif score >= 90:\n    grade = \"A\"\nelif score >= 80:\n    grade = \"B\"\nelif score >= 70:\n    grade = \"C\"\nelif score >= 60:\n    grade = \"D\"\nelse:\n    grade = \"F\"\n\n# Print the grade\nprint(\"Your grade is\", grade)\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly, using `float(input())` to get the student's score, the specified conditional statements to determine the grade, and `print()` to display the result.",
