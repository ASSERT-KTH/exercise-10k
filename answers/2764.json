  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and prints out the number of characters in the string.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef count_characters(input_string):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of characters in a given string.\"\"\"\n    return len(input_string)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    char_count = count_characters(input_string)\n    print(f\"The string has {char_count} characters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `count_characters` function uses Python's built-in `len` function to count the number of characters in the string. The `main` function gets user input, calls `count_characters` with that input, and prints out the result.\n\nTo run this program:\n\n1. Save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `char_counter.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python char_counter.py` to run the program.\n4. When prompted, enter a string.\n5. The program will print out the number of characters in the string.",
