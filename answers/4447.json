  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a string and a number as input and prints out the string repeated that many times.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python:\n\n```python\ndef repeat_string(s, n):\n    result = s * n\n    print(result)\n\n# Test the function\nrepeat_string(\"Hello\", 3)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `repeat_string` that takes two parameters: `s` (the string to repeat) and `n` (the number of times to repeat the string). Inside the function, the `*` operator is used to repeat the string `n` times. The result is then printed out. \n\nWhen you run this program, it will print \"HelloHelloHello\".",
