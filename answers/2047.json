  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function to sort the keys of a dictionary and return them as a list. This function will take a dictionary as input, sort its keys, and return a list of the sorted keys. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_keys(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a dictionary as input, sorts its keys, and returns them as a list.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sorted dictionary keys.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to get all the keys from the dictionary. We can use the .keys() method for this.\n    keys = dictionary.keys()\n\n    # Since .keys() returns a dictionary view object, we need to convert it to a list. We can use the list() function for this.\n    keys_list = list(keys)\n\n    # Now, we can sort the list of keys. We can use the sorted() function for this.\n    # The sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.\n    sorted_keys = sorted(keys_list)\n\n    # Finally, we return the sorted list of keys.\n    return sorted_keys\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}\nprint(sort_dict_keys(my_dict))  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sort_dict_keys` starts by retrieving all the keys from the input `dictionary` using the `.keys()` method and stores them in the `keys` variable.\n* The `keys` variable is then converted to a list `keys_list` using the `list()` function, as `.keys()` returns a dictionary view object.\n* The `sorted()` function is used to sort the `keys_list` in ascending order, and the result is stored in the `sorted_keys` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the `sorted_keys` list, which contains the sorted keys of the input dictionary.",
