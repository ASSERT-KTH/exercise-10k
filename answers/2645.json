  "answer": "### Dictionary Iteration Function\n\nHere's a Python function that iterates over a dictionary and prints its keys and values.\n\n```python\ndef print_dict(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Iterate over a dictionary and print its keys and values.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for key, value in dictionary.items():\n        print(f\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"age\": 30,\n        \"city\": \"New York\"\n    }\n    print_dict(example_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes a dictionary as an argument.\n2. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the dictionary's items, which returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.\n3. Inside the loop, it prints each key-value pair.\n\n### Alternative Methods\n\nThere are other ways to iterate over a dictionary, including:\n\n* Iterating over keys only: `for key in dictionary.keys():`\n* Iterating over values only: `for value in dictionary.values():`\n\nHowever, the `items()` method is the most common and efficient way to iterate over both keys and values simultaneously.",
