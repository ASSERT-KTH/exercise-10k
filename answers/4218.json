  "answer": "**Calculating the Mode of an Array**\n=====================================\n\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in an array. Here is a step-by-step solution to calculate the mode of an array:\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. **Create a frequency dictionary**: Iterate through the array and store the frequency of each element in a dictionary.\n2. **Find the maximum frequency**: Iterate through the frequency dictionary and find the maximum frequency.\n3. **Find the mode(s)**: Iterate through the frequency dictionary and find the element(s) with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mode(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of mode(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a frequency dictionary\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for element in array:\n        if element in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency_dict.values())\n\n    # Find the mode(s)\n    modes = [element for element, frequency in frequency_dict.items() if frequency == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nmodes = calculate_mode(array)\nprint(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_mode` function takes an array as input and returns a list of mode(s).\n*   The function first creates a frequency dictionary using a dictionary comprehension.\n*   It then finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the dictionary values.\n*   Finally, it finds the mode(s) by iterating through the frequency dictionary and returning the element(s) with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the `calculate_mode` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function iterates through the array twice: once to create the frequency dictionary and once to find the mode(s).\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the `calculate_mode` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function creates a frequency dictionary that can potentially store n elements.",
