  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nHere is a simple Python code snippet that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.\n* The `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n* The `print(i)` statement prints the current value of `i`.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can also use this code in a main function with example usage:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(start, end):\n    \"\"\"Print numbers from start to end\"\"\"\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        print(i)\n\ndef main():\n    start = 1\n    end = 10\n    print(f\"Printing numbers from {start} to {end}:\")\n    print_numbers(start, end)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
