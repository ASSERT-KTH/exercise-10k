  "answer": "**Lucas Number Calculator using Dynamic Programming**\n====================================================\n\nThe Lucas numbers are a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.\n\n**Code**\n-------\n\n```python\ndef lucas(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Lucas number using dynamic programming.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The index of the Lucas number to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The nth Lucas number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the Lucas numbers\n    lucas_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)\n    lucas_numbers[0] = 2\n    lucas_numbers[1] = 1\n\n    # Calculate the Lucas numbers using dynamic programming\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        lucas_numbers[i] = lucas_numbers[i - 1] + lucas_numbers[i - 2]\n\n    return lucas_numbers[n]\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    n = 10  # Calculate the 10th Lucas number\n    result = lucas(n)\n    print(f\"The {n}th Lucas number is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1.  The `lucas` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Lucas number.\n2.  The base cases are handled first: if `n` is 0, the function returns 2, and if `n` is 1, the function returns 1.\n3.  A list `lucas_numbers` is initialized to store the Lucas numbers, with the first two elements set to 2 and 1, respectively.\n4.  The function then uses a loop to calculate the Lucas numbers from 2 to `n`, using the previous two numbers in the sequence.\n5.  Finally, the `n`th Lucas number is returned.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-----------------\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as it needs to iterate from 2 to `n` to calculate the Lucas numbers.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n), as the algorithm stores the Lucas numbers in a list of size `n + 1`.",
