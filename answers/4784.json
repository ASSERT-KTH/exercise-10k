  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and then prints out their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for two numbers\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the two numbers\nsum_of_nums = num1 + num2\n\n# Print out the sum\nprint(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_nums}.\")\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. **Get User Input**: The program uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user to enter two numbers. The `float` function is used to convert the user's input into a floating-point number, allowing the user to enter decimal numbers.\n2. **Calculate the Sum**: The program calculates the sum of the two numbers using the `+` operator.\n3. **Print the Result**: The program prints out the sum of the two numbers using an f-string, which allows it to insert the values of `num1`, `num2`, and `sum_of_nums` into the string.\n\n### Example Use Case\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter two numbers. For example, if you enter `5` and `7`, the program will print out:\n```\nThe sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is 12.0.\n```",
