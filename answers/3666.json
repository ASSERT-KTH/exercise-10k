  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting with a default name if none is provided. This will help you understand how to handle optional input parameters in Python functions. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name=\"World\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a greeting with the provided name.\n    \n    If no name is provided, it defaults to 'World'.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    name (str): The name to be used in the greeting. Defaults to 'World'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the name is not empty or None\n    if name is not None and name != \"\":\n        \n        # If the name is provided, we print a greeting with the name\n        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    \n    # If the name is not provided or is empty, we print a default greeting\n    else:\n        print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Test the function\nprint_greeting(\"John\")  # Outputs: Hello, John!\nprint_greeting()  # Outputs: Hello, World!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_greeting` is defined with an optional parameter `name` that defaults to `'World'` if not provided. This allows the function to handle cases where no name is given.\n* Inside the function, a conditional check is performed to ensure the `name` is not `None` or an empty string. If the `name` is valid, a personalized greeting is printed using an f-string.\n* If the `name` is empty or `None`, a default greeting is printed instead, using the default value `'World'`.\n* Example usage of the function is demonstrated with `print_greeting('John')` and `print_greeting()`, showcasing both cases where a name is provided and where it's not.",
