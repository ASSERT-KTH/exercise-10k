  "answer": "**Calculating Average Grade using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for grade in grades:\n        total += grade\n    average = total / len(grades)\n    return average\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    grades = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    print(f\"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a list of grades as input.\n2. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of all grades.\n3. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each grade in the list.\n4. Inside the loop, each grade is added to the `total`.\n5. After the loop, the average grade is calculated by dividing the `total` by the number of grades (i.e., the length of the list).\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_grade` function with an example list of grades.\n7. The average grade is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nAverage Grade: 86.60\n```",
