  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message with their name. The program should also ask for the user's age and print out a message stating whether they are an adult or not.",
  "answer": "Based on the specification, here is the code:\n```\nimport sys\n\n# User's Name (line 1)\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\n# User's Age (lines 2-4)\nage = input(\"How old are you? \")\nage = int(age)\n\n# Greeting Message (lines 5-6)\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Adult or Not (lines 7-15)\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not an adult!\")\n```\nThis code imports the `sys` module, but it's not actually used anywhere in the code, so it's not necessary. The code prompts the user for their name and age, converts the age to an integer, prints a greeting message, and determines whether the user is an adult based on their age.",
