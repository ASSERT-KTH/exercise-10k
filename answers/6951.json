  "prompt": "Create a function that takes no arguments and prints 'Hello World' to the console.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a simple function that prints a greeting message to the console. This function will serve as a basic example of how to structure and execute code in a programming environment. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes no arguments and prints 'Hello World' to the console.\ndef print_hello_world():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints 'Hello World' to the console.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    None\n    \n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the print function to output 'Hello World' to the console.\n    print(\"Hello World\")\n\n# Call the function to execute it.\nprint_hello_world()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_hello_world` is defined with no parameters, as per the problem statement. It includes a docstring that provides a description of what the function does, its parameters, and its return values.\n* Inside the function, the `print` function is used to output the string 'Hello World' to the console. However, the original code contains a syntax error - the string 'Hello World' should be enclosed in quotes.\n* To fix the syntax error, the corrected line should read: `print('Hello World')`.\n* Finally, the function is called by invoking `print_hello_world()` to execute the code within the function and print the greeting message to the console.",
