  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number (inclusive) using a for loop or a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem using both a for loop and a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_for(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a for loop.\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\ndef sum_even_while(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a while loop.\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n        i += 1\n    return total\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(f\"Sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} (for loop): {sum_even_for(n)}\")\nprint(f\"Sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} (while loop): {sum_even_while(n)}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define two functions: `sum_even_for` and `sum_even_while`. Both functions take an integer `n` as input and return the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n\nThe `sum_even_for` function uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`). If `i` is even, it adds `i` to the `total` sum.\n\nThe `sum_even_while` function uses a while loop to achieve the same result. It initializes a variable `i` to 1 and then enters a loop that continues until `i` is greater than `n`. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is even and adds it to the `total` sum if it is. After each iteration, it increments `i` by 1.\n\nFinally, we provide an example usage of both functions by calculating the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using both the for loop and the while loop.",
