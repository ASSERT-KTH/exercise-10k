  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generation Function**\n=========================================\n\nThe following is an example of a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(f\"The first {n} Fibonacci numbers are: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n2. It handles the base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n4. It then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` reaches `n`.\n5. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the sequence.\n6. Finally, it returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe first 10 Fibonacci numbers are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
