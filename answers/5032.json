  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that counts the frequency of each word in a given text using for loops:\n\n```python\ndef count_word_frequency(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each word in a given text.\n    \n    Args:\n    text (str): The input text.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert the text to lower case and split it into words\n    words = text.lower().split()\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the word frequencies\n    word_frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the text\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation from the word\n        word = ''.join(e for e in word if e.isalnum())\n        \n        # If the word is already in the dictionary, increment its frequency\n        if word in word_frequency:\n            word_frequency[word] += 1\n        # If the word is not in the dictionary, add it with a frequency of 1\n        else:\n            word_frequency[word] = 1\n    \n    return word_frequency\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a test. This test is only a test.\"\nprint(count_word_frequency(text))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is converted to lower case to ensure the word frequency count is case-insensitive. The text is then split into individual words.\n2. **Dictionary Initialization**: An empty dictionary is initialized to store the word frequencies. The dictionary keys will be the unique words, and the values will be their corresponding frequencies.\n3. **Word Frequency Counting**: The program iterates over each word in the text. For each word, punctuation is removed, and the word is checked against the dictionary. If the word is already in the dictionary, its frequency is incremented; otherwise, the word is added to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. **Result**: The function returns the dictionary containing the word frequencies.\n\n### Output\n\nFor the example text \"This is a test. This test is only a test.\", the output will be:\n```python\n{'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test': 3, 'only': 1}\n```\n\nNote that this program considers contractions (e.g., \"don't\") as a single word and does not handle stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form). For more advanced text processing tasks, consider using natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy.",
