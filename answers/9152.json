  "answer": "### Short-Circuit Evaluation Example\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that demonstrates the use of logical operators with short-circuit evaluation.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Define two functions to be used in the expression\n    def is_positive(x):\n        print(f\"Checking if {x} is positive...\")\n        return x > 0\n\n    def is_even(x):\n        print(f\"Checking if {x} is even...\")\n        return x % 2 == 0\n\n    # Use short-circuit evaluation with logical operators\n    x = 5\n    result1 = is_positive(x) and is_even(x)\n    print(f\"Result 1: {result1}\")\n\n    x = 4\n    result2 = is_positive(x) and is_even(x)\n    print(f\"Result 2: {result2}\")\n\n    x = -4\n    result3 = is_positive(x) or is_even(x)\n    print(f\"Result 3: {result3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define two functions `is_positive(x)` and `is_even(x)` to check if a number `x` is positive and even, respectively. These functions also print messages to show when they are called.\n\n2. We use the `and` and `or` logical operators with these functions in three different expressions.\n\n3. The `and` operator uses short-circuit evaluation, meaning that if the first operand is `False`, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be `False` regardless.\n\n4. The `or` operator also uses short-circuit evaluation, meaning that if the first operand is `True`, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be `True` regardless.\n\n5. We run the code with different values of `x` to demonstrate the short-circuit evaluation.\n\nWhen you run this code, you will see that the functions are called only when necessary, demonstrating the short-circuit evaluation behavior of the logical operators.",
