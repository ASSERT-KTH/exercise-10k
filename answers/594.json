  "answer": "**Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes an array of numbers as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The LIS is a subsequence where every element is greater than its previous element.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): The input array of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position\n    lis = [1] * len(nums)\n\n    # Compute the lengths of LIS ending at each position\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if nums[i] > nums[j]:\n                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n\n    # Return the maximum length of LIS\n    return max(lis)\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\n    print(\"Length of longest increasing subsequence:\", longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  Initialize a list `lis` to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position.\n2.  Iterate through the input array, and for each element, compare it with all previous elements.\n3.  If the current element is greater than a previous element, update the length of LIS ending at the current position if necessary.\n4.  Finally, return the maximum length of LIS found.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we have two nested loops iterating through the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the lengths of LIS ending at each position in the `lis` list.",
