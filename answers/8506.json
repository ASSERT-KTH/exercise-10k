Each function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n*   The `divide` function checks if the second number is zero to prevent a division by zero error. If the second number is zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   The `main` function serves as the program's entry point. It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose an arithmetic operation.\n*   Based on the user's choice, the program prompts for two numbers and then calls the corresponding function to perform the operation.\n*   Finally, the program displays the result of the operation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: If the user chooses addition and enters 5 and 3, the program will output `5 + 3 = 8.0`.\n*   Subtraction: If the user chooses subtraction and enters 10 and 4, the program will output `10 - 4 = 6.0`.\n*   Multiplication: If the user chooses multiplication and enters 7 and 2, the program will output `7 * 2 = 14.0`.\n*   Division: If the user chooses division and enters 9 and 3, the program will output `9 / 3 = 3.0`. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.",
