  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python function that checks if a number is prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_prime(11))  # True\n    print(is_prime(15))  # False\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so we return False.\n2. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of the number, so we use `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` as the upper bound for our loop.\n3. We iterate over the range of possible divisors and check if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is, we return False.\n4. If we don't find any divisors, the number is prime, so we return True.\n\n**Note**: This function has a time complexity of O(\u221an), making it efficient for large numbers. However, for extremely large numbers, you may want to use a more advanced primality test like the Miller-Rabin test.",
