  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\nHere's a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess when prompted.\n4. The program will give you a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help you narrow down your next guess.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n\nNote: This program uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for their guess until they find the correct number or type \"quit\". It also uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user enters something that's not a valid number.",
