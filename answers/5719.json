  "answer": "**Calculator Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple calculator program written in Python that takes a mathematical expression as input and evaluates it.\n\n```python\n# calculator.py\n\ndef calculate(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates a mathematical expression.\n\n    Args:\n        expression (str): A string representing a mathematical expression.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the evaluated expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n\n    while True:\n        expression = input(\"Enter a mathematical expression (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if expression.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        result = calculate(expression)\n        if result is not None:\n            print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate` function takes a mathematical expression as a string and evaluates it using the built-in `eval` function.\n2. The `eval` function parses the expression and executes it as Python code.\n3. If an error occurs during evaluation, the function catches the exception and returns `None`.\n4. The `main` function provides a simple command-line interface for the calculator.\n5. It repeatedly prompts the user for a mathematical expression until the user types 'quit' to exit.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Evaluate a simple arithmetic expression: `2 + 2`\n* Evaluate an expression with multiple operators: `2 + 2 * 3`\n* Evaluate an expression with parentheses: `(2 + 2) * 3`\n\n**Note**: The `eval` function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input, as it can evaluate arbitrary Python code. In this example, we assume that the input is trusted. If you plan to use this code in a production environment, consider using a safer evaluation method, such as using a parsing library or writing a custom parser.",
