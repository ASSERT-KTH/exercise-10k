  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef filter_list(list_to_filter, condition):\n    filter_list = []\n    for element in list_to_filter:\n        if condition(element):\n            filter_list.append(element)\n    return filter_list\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef is_divisible_by_two(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\ndivisible_by_two = filter_list(numbers, is_divisible_by_two)\n\ndef is_divisible_by_three(num):\n    return num % 3 == 0\n\ndivisible_by_three = filter_list(numbers, is_divisible_by_three)\n```\nThis code defines the `filter_list` function, which takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition. It also defines two specific conditions, `is_divisible_by_two` and `is_divisible_by_three`, and applies them to the `numbers` list using the `filter_list` function. The resulting lists are stored in the `divisible_by_two` and `divisible_by_three` variables.",
