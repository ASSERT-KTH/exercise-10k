  "prompt": "Write a program to perform bitwise operations using variables, such as AND, OR, and XOR.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs bitwise operations using variables:\n```python\n# Define two variables\na = 5   # Binary: 101\nb = 3   # Binary: 011\n\n# Print the binary representation of the variables\nprint(f\"Binary representation of {a}: {bin(a)[2:]}\")\nprint(f\"Binary representation of {b}: {bin(b)[2:]}\")\n\n# Perform bitwise operations\nand_result = a & b\nor_result = a | b\nxor_result = a ^ b\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"a AND b: {and_result} ({bin(and_result)[2:]})\")\nprint(f\"a OR b: {or_result} ({bin(or_result)[2:]})\")\nprint(f\"a XOR b: {xor_result} ({bin(xor_result)[2:]})\")\n```\nThis program first defines two variables `a` and `b` with values 5 and 3, respectively. It then prints their binary representations using the `bin()` function.\n\nNext, it performs three bitwise operations:\n\n1.  **AND**: `a & b` performs a bitwise AND operation, where each bit is set to 1 only if both corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are 1.\n2.  **OR**: `a | b` performs a bitwise OR operation, where each bit is set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` is 1.\n3.  **XOR**: `a ^ b` performs a bitwise XOR operation, where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different.\n\nThe results of these operations are stored in `and_result`, `or_result`, and `xor_result`, respectively. Finally, the program prints the decimal and binary representations of the results.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nBinary representation of 5: 101\nBinary representation of 3: 11\na AND b: 1 (1)\na OR b: 7 (111)\na XOR b: 6 (110)\n```\nThis output demonstrates the bitwise operations on the variables `a` and `b`. The binary representations of the results show the bit-by-bit calculations performed during the operations.",
