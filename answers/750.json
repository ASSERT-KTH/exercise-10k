  "answer": "**Weather Messenger Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes the current weather as input and prints out a corresponding message.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_weather_message(weather):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a message based on the current weather.\n\n    Args:\n        weather (str): The current weather.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message corresponding to the weather.\n    \"\"\"\n    weather_messages = {\n        \"sunny\": \"It's a beautiful day! Go outside and enjoy the sunshine.\",\n        \"cloudy\": \"It's a bit gloomy today. Maybe stay indoors and read a book.\",\n        \"rainy\": \"Don't forget your umbrella! It's raining outside.\",\n        \"snowy\": \"It's a winter wonderland! Grab your scarf and gloves and go play in the snow.\",\n        \"windy\": \"Hold onto your hat! It's a bit breezy today.\",\n    }\n\n    return weather_messages.get(weather.lower(), \"I'm not sure what to say about this weather...\")\n\ndef main():\n    weather = input(\"Enter the current weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, windy): \")\n    message = get_weather_message(weather)\n    print(message)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the current weather when prompted (e.g., \"sunny\").\n3. The program will print out a corresponding message.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a dictionary to map weather conditions to messages.\n* The `get_weather_message` function takes a weather string as input and returns a message.\n* The `main` function gets the current weather from the user, calls `get_weather_message`, and prints the result.\n* The program uses `input` to get user input and `print` to display the message.",
