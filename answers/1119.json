  "answer": "**Credit Card Interest Calculator Program**\n=============================================\n\nThis program calculates the interest charged on a credit card given the outstanding balance, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_credit_card_interest(outstanding_balance, interest_rate, time_period):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the interest charged on a credit card.\n\n    Args:\n        outstanding_balance (float): The outstanding balance on the credit card.\n        interest_rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal (e.g., 18% = 0.18).\n        time_period (int): The time period in months.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total interest charged.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the monthly interest rate\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n\n    # Calculate the total interest charged\n    total_interest = outstanding_balance * monthly_interest_rate * time_period\n\n    return total_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    outstanding_balance = 1000.0\n    interest_rate = 0.18  # 18% interest rate\n    time_period = 6  # 6 months\n\n    total_interest = calculate_credit_card_interest(outstanding_balance, interest_rate, time_period)\n\n    print(f\"Outstanding Balance: ${outstanding_balance:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {interest_rate*100}%\")\n    print(f\"Time Period: {time_period} months\")\n    print(f\"Total Interest Charged: ${total_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_credit_card_interest` function takes in the outstanding balance, interest rate, and time period as arguments.\n2. It calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.\n3. It calculates the total interest charged by multiplying the outstanding balance, monthly interest rate, and time period.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of the `calculate_credit_card_interest` function.\n5. It prints out the outstanding balance, interest rate, time period, and total interest charged.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the interest charged on a credit card with an outstanding balance of $1000, an interest rate of 18%, and a time period of 6 months.\n* Calculate the interest charged on a credit card with an outstanding balance of $500, an interest rate of 22%, and a time period of 12 months.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes a simple interest calculation, where the interest is calculated based on the outstanding balance and does not take into account any compounding interest or fees. In reality, credit card interest calculations can be more complex and may involve compounding interest, fees, and other factors.",
