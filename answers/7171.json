  "answer": "**Caesar Cipher Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program implements a Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    Encrypts a string by shifting each character by a fixed amount.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input string to be encrypted.\n        shift (int): The number of positions to shift each character.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The encrypted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for char in text:\n        # Check if character is an uppercase letter\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character\n            # and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - 65 + shift) % 26 + 65)\n        # Check if character is a lowercase letter\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character\n            # and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - 97 + shift) % 26 + 97)\n        # If the character is not a letter, leave it unchanged\n        else:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter the string to be encrypted: \")\n    shift = int(input(\"Enter the shift value: \"))\n\n    encrypted_text = caesar_cipher(text, shift)\n    print(f\"Encrypted text: {encrypted_text}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `caesar_cipher` function takes two arguments: `text` and `shift`.\n2. It iterates over each character in the `text`.\n3. If the character is an uppercase or lowercase letter, it calculates the new character by shifting the current character by the specified amount.\n4. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of the character, and `chr` is used to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n5. The ASCII values for 'A' to 'Z' are 65 to 90, and those for 'a' to 'z' are 97 to 122.\n6. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet if necessary.\n7. If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged.\n8. The `main` function prompts the user for the string to be encrypted and the shift value, calls the `caesar_cipher` function, and prints the encrypted text.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: `Hello, World!`\n* Shift: `3`\n* Output: `Khoor, Zruog!`",
