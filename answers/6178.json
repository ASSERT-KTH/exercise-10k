  "answer": "### Prime Number Checker Function\n#### Overview\nThis function checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:  # Prime numbers are greater than 1\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):  # Check divisibility up to the square root of n\n        if n % i == 0:  # If n is divisible by any number, it's not prime\n            return False\n    return True  # If n is not divisible by any number, it's prime\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"Is {num} prime? {is_prime(num)}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any number in the range, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any number in the range, it's prime, so the function returns `True`.",
