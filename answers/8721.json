  "answer": "### Declaring Variables and Printing Values\n\nBelow is an example code written in Python, demonstrating how to declare variables for a student's name and age and then print out these values.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the values\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Variable Declaration**: We declare two variables, `student_name` and `student_age`, using the assignment operator (`=`). The `student_name` variable is assigned a string value (\"John Doe\"), and the `student_age` variable is assigned an integer value (`20`).\n2. **Printing Values**: We use the `print()` function to output the values of `student_name` and `student_age`. The `print()` function can take multiple arguments, which are separated by commas. When you run this code, it will display the student's name and age.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nTo run this code, save it in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `student_info.py`) and execute it using a Python interpreter. The output should look like this:\n\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```",
