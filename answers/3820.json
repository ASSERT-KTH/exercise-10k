  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses a for loop to implement a Caesar cipher:\n\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    Shifts each letter in the given text by the specified number of positions.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text to be encrypted.\n        shift (int): The number of positions to shift each letter.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The encrypted text.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\nshift = 3\nencrypted_text = caesar_cipher(text, shift)\nprint(f\"Original text: {text}\")\nprint(f\"Encrypted text: {encrypted_text}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `caesar_cipher` function takes two arguments: `text` (the input string) and `shift` (the number of positions to shift each letter).\n*   Inside the function, a for loop iterates over each character in the input `text`.\n*   For each character, it checks if the character is a letter using the `isalpha` method.\n*   If it's a letter, it calculates the new character by shifting the ASCII value of the original character by the specified amount, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary (using the modulo operator `% 26`).\n*   If it's not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation mark), it leaves the character unchanged.\n*   The encrypted characters are appended to the `result` string, which is returned at the end of the function.\n*   In the example usage, the function is called with the text \"Hello, World!\" and a shift of 3, and the encrypted text is printed to the console.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1.  Define a function `caesar_cipher` that takes two arguments: `text` and `shift`.\n2.  Initialize an empty string `result` to store the encrypted text.\n3.  Use a for loop to iterate over each character `char` in the input `text`.\n4.  For each character, check if it's a letter using the `isalpha` method.\n5.  If it's a letter, calculate the new character by shifting the ASCII value of the original character by the specified amount.\n6.  If it's not a letter, leave the character unchanged.\n7.  Append the encrypted character (or the original character if it's not a letter) to the `result` string.\n8.  After the loop finishes, return the encrypted `result` string.\n9.  Call the `caesar_cipher` function with a sample text and shift, and print the encrypted result to the console.",
