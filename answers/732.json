  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes the scores of a student in three subjects as input and outputs their total score and average score:\n\n```\n# Define a function to calculate total and average scores\ndef calculate_scores():\n    # Get scores from user\n    score1 = float(input(\"Enter score in subject 1: \"))\n    score2 = float(input(\"Enter score in subject 2: \"))\n    score3 = float(input(\"Enter score in subject 3: \"))\n\n    # Calculate total score\n    total_score = score1 + score2 + score3\n\n    # Calculate average score\n    average_score = total_score / 3\n\n    # Print total and average scores\n    print(f\"Total score: {total_score}\")\n    print(f\"Average score: {average_score}\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_scores()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_scores()` that:\n\n1. **Gets scores from user**: Uses the `input()` function to get the scores of the student in three subjects.\n2. **Calculates total score**: Adds up the scores of the three subjects.\n3. **Calculates average score**: Divides the total score by 3 to get the average score.\n4. **Prints total and average scores**: Uses the `print()` function to display the total and average scores.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the scores in three subjects. For example:\n\n```\nEnter score in subject 1: 80\nEnter score in subject 2: 90\nEnter score in subject 3: 70\n```\n\nThe program will then output the total and average scores:\n\n```\nTotal score: 240.0\nAverage score: 80.0\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the scores are numeric values. If you want to handle non-numeric inputs, you can add error handling code to the program.",
