  "answer": "**Good Variable Naming Conventions Program**\n==============================================\n\nThis program demonstrates good variable naming conventions in Python. It includes examples of descriptive variable names, consistent naming styles, and avoidance of reserved keywords.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport datetime\n\ndef calculate_total_cost(subtotal, tax_rate, discount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of an order.\n\n    Args:\n        subtotal (float): The subtotal of the order.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal.\n        discount (float): The discount amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the tax amount\n    tax_amount = subtotal * tax_rate\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = subtotal + tax_amount - discount\n\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Define variables with descriptive names\n    order_subtotal = 100.0\n    tax_rate_percentage = 0.08\n    customer_discount = 10.0\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    order_total_cost = calculate_total_cost(order_subtotal, tax_rate_percentage, customer_discount)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Order Subtotal: $\", order_subtotal)\n    print(\"Tax Rate: \", tax_rate_percentage * 100, \"%\")\n    print(\"Discount: $\", customer_discount)\n    print(\"Total Cost: $\", order_total_cost)\n\n    # Get the current date and time\n    current_date_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n    print(\"Current Date and Time: \", current_date_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program demonstrates good variable naming conventions in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Descriptive variable names**: Variable names like `order_subtotal`, `tax_rate_percentage`, and `customer_discount` clearly describe their purpose.\n2.  **Consistent naming style**: The program uses a consistent naming style, with variable names in lowercase and words separated by underscores.\n3.  **Avoidance of reserved keywords**: The program avoids using reserved keywords like `class`, `def`, and `import` as variable names.\n4.  **Use of meaningful function names**: Function names like `calculate_total_cost` clearly describe their purpose.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the program is more readable and maintainable, making it easier for others to understand and modify the code.",
