Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a number between 1 and 100 and ask you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess when prompted.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n6. The program will display the number of attempts it took you to guess the number correctly.\n\n**Note**\n-------\n\n* The `get_computer_number` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n* The `get_user_guess` function gets the user's guess and validates it to ensure it is a whole number between 1 and 100.\n* The `check_guess` function checks if the user's guess is correct and provides feedback if it is not.\n* The `play_game` function plays the number guessing game, keeping track of the number of attempts it takes the user to guess the number correctly.",
