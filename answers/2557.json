  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses a generator to produce a sequence of numbers and then calculates their sum.\n\n### Generator for Sequence of Numbers\n```python\ndef sequence_generator(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator function to produce a sequence of numbers from 1 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n    \n    Yields:\n        int: The next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        yield i\n\ndef calculate_sum(generator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of numbers produced by the generator.\n    \n    Args:\n        generator: The generator object that produces the sequence of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(generator)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Change this to generate a different sequence\n    generator = sequence_generator(n)\n    total_sum = calculate_sum(generator)\n    print(f\"Sum of the sequence from 1 to {n}: {total_sum}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generator Function**: The `sequence_generator` function is a generator that produces a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range and yields each number.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The `calculate_sum` function takes a generator object as an argument and uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers produced by the generator.\n3. **Example Usage**: In the example code, we create a generator for a sequence from 1 to 10, calculate the sum using the `calculate_sum` function, and print the result.\n\n### Advantages of Using Generators\n* **Memory Efficiency**: Generators use significantly less memory than storing the entire sequence in a list or array, especially for large sequences.\n* **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators only produce the next value when requested, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful when working with large datasets or sequences where memory efficiency is crucial.",
