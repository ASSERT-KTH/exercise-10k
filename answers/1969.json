  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a person's name as an argument and returns a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting message based on the input provided. This will help you understand how to craft a simple yet effective function for such purposes. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'greet' that takes one argument 'name'.\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates a greeting message based on the input name.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The person's name.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A greeting message with the person's name.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is a string. If not, raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n\n    # Use an f-string to format the greeting message with the person's name.\n    # This is a more modern and efficient way of formatting strings in Python.\n    greeting_message = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    # Return the greeting message.\n    return greeting_message\n\n# Test the function with a sample name.\nprint(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `greet` function is defined with a parameter `name`, which is expected to be a string. It includes a docstring that explains its purpose, the argument it takes, and what it returns.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed using `isinstance(name, str)` to ensure that the input `name` is indeed a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a message indicating that the input must be a string.\n* An f-string is used to format the greeting message. The variable `name` is embedded within the string using `{name}`, allowing for a dynamic greeting based on the input provided.\n* Finally, the function returns the formatted `greeting_message`, which can then be printed or used as needed in the program.",
