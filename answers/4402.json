  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. Use a while loop to repeat the guessing process until the user correctly guesses the number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport random\n\n# Generate a random number between 1 and 100\nnumber_to_find = random.randrange(1, 100)\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of attempts\nattempts = 0\n\n# Start the game\nprint(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\nprint(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\nwhile True:\n    # Ask the user for their guess\n    user_guess = int(input(\"What's your guess? \"))\n\n    # Increment the number of attempts\n    attempts += 1\n\n    # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the correct answer\n    if user_guess < number_to_find:\n        print(\"Too low!\")\n    elif user_guess > number_to_find:\n        print(\"Too high!\")\n    else:\n        # Check if the user guessed correctly on the first attempt\n        if attempts == 1:\n            print(\"You won! Congratulations!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"You won!\")\n        print(f\"It took you {attempts} attempts to guess correctly.\")\n        break\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including generating a random number, asking the user for their guess, checking the user's guess, and providing feedback and winning conditions. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!",
