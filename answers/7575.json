  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that utilizes type checking to verify the types of its parameters and return value, ensuring robustness and reliability in your code. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function with type checking for parameters and return value\ndef add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function adds two integers together.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer to add.\n        b (int): The second integer to add.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the two integers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if both parameters are integers\n    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both parameters must be integers.\")\n\n    # Add the two numbers together\n    result = a + b\n\n    # Check if the result is an integer\n    if not isinstance(result, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"The result must be an integer.\")\n\n    # Return the result\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(add_numbers(5, 7))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `add_numbers` is defined with type hints for its parameters `a` and `b` as `int`, and the return type is also specified as `int`. This provides a clear indication of the expected input and output types.\n* Inside the function, `isinstance` checks are performed to ensure that both `a` and `b` are indeed integers. If not, a `TypeError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* The function then calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `result`.\n* Before returning `result`, another `isinstance` check is performed to verify that the result is an integer, further ensuring the correctness of the function's output.",
