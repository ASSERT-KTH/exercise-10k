  "answer": "### Symmetric Difference of Two Dictionaries\n#### Function Description\n\nThe symmetric difference of two dictionaries is a dictionary containing all key-value pairs that are in exactly one of the dictionaries. This function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary containing their symmetric difference.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference of two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing the symmetric difference of dict1 and dict2.\n    \"\"\"\n    symmetric_diff = {}\n    all_keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n\n    for key in all_keys:\n        value1 = dict1.get(key)\n        value2 = dict2.get(key)\n\n        if (value1 is None) ^ (value2 is None):\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value1 if value1 is not None else value2\n        elif value1 != value2:\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value1\n\n    return symmetric_diff\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n    dict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\n    result = symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2)\n    print(result)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 4}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThis function works by first creating a set of all keys in both dictionaries. Then, it iterates over each key. If a key is present in only one dictionary, it adds the key-value pair to the symmetric difference dictionary. If a key is present in both dictionaries but has different values, it adds the key-value pair from the first dictionary to the symmetric difference dictionary. Finally, it returns the symmetric difference dictionary.",
