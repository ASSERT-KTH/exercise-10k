  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe between two players.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python:\n\n```python\n# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # We will use a single list to represent the 3x3 board\n\ndef print_board():\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef check_win():\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if ' ' not in board:\n        return 'Tie'\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_win()\n        if result:\n            print_board()\n            if result == 'Tie':\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Player {} wins!\".format(result))\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run:**\n\n1. Copy the code into a Python file, for example `tic_tac_toe.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the file using Python, for example `python tic_tac_toe.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n1. The game prints the current state of the board.\n2. The current player is asked to enter their move (1-9).\n3. If the move is valid, the player's mark (X or O) is placed on the board.\n4. The game checks if there is a winner or a tie.\n5. If there is a winner or a tie, the game prints the final state of the board and announces the winner or tie.\n6. If there is no winner or tie, the game switches to the other player and repeats steps 1-5.",
