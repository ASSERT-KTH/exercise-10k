  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns -1 if the first string is less than the second string, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the first string is greater than the second string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include \"stdafx.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string s1, s2;\n    std::cin >> s1;\n    std::cin >> s2;\n    std::cout << (s1.compare(s2));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads two strings from standard input, compares them using the `compare` method, and prints the result of the comparison to standard output. The `compare` method returns an integer value indicating the result of the comparison, where:\n\n* A value less than 0 means `s1` is less than `s2`.\n* A value of 0 means `s1` is equal to `s2`.\n* A value greater than 0 means `s1` is greater than `s2`.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input strings are separated by whitespace characters (such as spaces or tabs). If the input strings can be separated by other characters, the code may need to be modified accordingly.",
