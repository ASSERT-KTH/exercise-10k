  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in frequency:\n            frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[char] = 1\n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency = char_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, freq in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {freq}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function `char_frequency`**: This function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with character frequencies.\n2.  **Initialization**: An empty dictionary `frequency` is created to store character frequencies.\n3.  **Character Iteration**: The function iterates over each character in the input string.\n4.  **Frequency Update**: If a character is already in the `frequency` dictionary, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n5.  **Result**: The function returns the `frequency` dictionary.\n6.  **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use `char_frequency`. It prompts the user to input a string, calculates the character frequencies, and then prints the result.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use Python's built-in `Counter` class from the `collections` module to simplify the code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Counter(string)\n\n# Example usage remains the same as before.\n```\n\nThis version achieves the same result but with less code, leveraging the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of each character in the string.",
