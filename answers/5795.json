  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # Check for divisors up to the square root of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If a divisor is found, the number is not prime\n            return False\n    # If no divisors are found, the number is prime\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is prime: {is_prime(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.\n2.  If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `False`, as these numbers are not prime by definition.\n3.  The function then iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.\n4.  If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime.\n5.  If the function completes the iteration without finding any divisors, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(\u221an), as it only checks for divisors up to the square root of `n`. This makes it efficient for large numbers.",
