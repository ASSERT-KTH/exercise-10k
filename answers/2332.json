  "answer": "Here's a Python program that takes a string input from the user and handles potential errors:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Gets user input and handles exceptions.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        user_input = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n        return user_input\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"\\nError: Input interrupted by user.\")\n        return None\n    except EOFError:\n        print(\"Error: End of file reached unexpectedly.\")\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n\n\ndef print_user_input(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Prints the user's input to the screen.\"\"\"\n    if user_input is not None:\n        print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No input to print.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    user_input = get_user_input()\n    print_user_input(user_input)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. The `get_user_input` function attempts to get user input using `input()`.\n2. It catches specific exceptions that might occur during input:\n   * `KeyboardInterrupt`: When the user interrupts the input (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).\n   * `EOFError`: When the end of the file is reached unexpectedly (e.g., when input is redirected from a file).\n   * `Exception`: A catch-all for any other unexpected errors.\n3. The `print_user_input` function prints the user's input to the screen. If an error occurred during input, it prints a corresponding message.\n4. The `main` function coordinates the program by getting user input and printing it to the screen.\n\nThis code ensures that the program remains robust and provides informative error messages in case of unexpected issues during input.",
