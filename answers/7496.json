  "answer": "Here's an example of how you can perform basic list operations in Python:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Initialize the list\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    print(\"Initial list: \", my_list)\n\n    # Append an element to the list\n    my_list.append(6)\n    print(\"List after appending 6: \", my_list)\n\n    # Insert an element at a specific position\n    my_list.insert(2, 10)\n    print(\"List after inserting 10 at position 2: \", my_list)\n\n    # Remove the first occurrence of an element\n    my_list.remove(4)\n    print(\"List after removing 4: \", my_list)\n\n    # Remove an element at a specific position\n    my_list.pop(0)\n    print(\"List after removing the element at position 0: \", my_list)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Append**: The `append` method is used to add an element to the end of the list.\n2. **Insert**: The `insert` method is used to add an element at a specific position in the list. The first argument is the index at which the element should be inserted, and the second argument is the element itself.\n3. **Remove**: The `remove` method is used to remove the first occurrence of an element in the list. If the element is not found in the list, it raises a `ValueError`.\n4. **Pop**: The `pop` method is used to remove an element at a specific position in the list. If no index is provided, it removes the last element in the list.\n\n### Output:\n```\nInitial list:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nList after appending 6:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nList after inserting 10 at position 2:  [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nList after removing 4:  [1, 2, 10, 3, 5, 6]\nList after removing the element at position 0:  [2, 10, 3, 5, 6]\n```",
