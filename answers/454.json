  "answer": "**Magic 8-Ball Simulator**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball. The program will randomly select a response from a list of possible answers when the user asks a question.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Magic8Ball:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.responses = [\n            \"It is certain\",\n            \"It is decidedly so\",\n            \"Without a doubt\",\n            \"Yes definitely\",\n            \"You may rely on it\",\n            \"As I see it, yes\",\n            \"Most likely\",\n            \"Outlook good\",\n            \"Yes\",\n            \"Signs point to yes\",\n            \"Reply hazy try again\",\n            \"Ask again later\",\n            \"Better not tell you now\",\n            \"Cannot predict now\",\n            \"Concentrate and ask again\",\n            \"Don't count on it\",\n            \"My reply is no\",\n            \"My sources say no\",\n            \"Outlook not so good\",\n            \"Very doubtful\"\n        ]\n\n    def ask_question(self, question):\n        \"\"\"Ask the Magic 8-Ball a question and get a response\"\"\"\n        print(f\"You asked: {question}\")\n        response = random.choice(self.responses)\n        print(f\"Magic 8-Ball says: {response}\")\n\ndef main():\n    eight_ball = Magic8Ball()\n    print(\"Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball Simulator!\")\n    while True:\n        question = input(\"Ask a question (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if question.lower() == \"quit\":\n            break\n        eight_ball.ask_question(question)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Ask the Magic 8-Ball a question by typing it in when prompted.\n3. The Magic 8-Ball will respond with a random answer from its list of possible responses.\n4. To exit the program, type \"quit\" when prompted for a question.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n```\nWelcome to the Magic 8-Ball Simulator!\nAsk a question (or 'quit' to exit): Will I have a good day today?\nYou asked: Will I have a good day today?\nMagic 8-Ball says: Signs point to yes\nAsk a question (or 'quit' to exit): \n```",
