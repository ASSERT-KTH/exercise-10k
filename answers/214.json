  "answer": "### Getting User Age Function\n#### Description\nThe following function will prompt the user for their age and return the input as an integer.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef get_user_age():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prompts the user for their age and returns it as an integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The user's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age < 0:\n                print(\"Age cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                return age\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    user_age = get_user_age()\n    print(f\"Your age is: {user_age}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `get_user_age` function uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for their age until a valid input is provided.\n*   The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input to an integer. If successful, it checks if the age is non-negative. If not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n*   If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a string or a floating-point number), a `ValueError` exception is raised, and the `except` block catches it, printing an error message and continuing to the next iteration of the loop.\n*   Once a valid age is entered, the function returns the age as an integer.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `get_user_age` by calling it and printing the result.",
