  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\nHere is a simple Python program that checks if a given number is prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If it is, then `n` is not prime, and the function returns `False`.\n4. If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers checked, it is prime, and the function returns `True`.\n5. The `main` function asks the user to enter a number, checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23: The program will output \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 24: The program will output \"24 is not a prime number.\"\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0: The program will output \"0 is not a prime number.\"",
