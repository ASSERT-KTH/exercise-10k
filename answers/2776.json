  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef ask_questions(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user to answer a list of questions.\n\n    Args:\n        questions (list): A list of questions to ask the user.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of answers from the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    answers = []\n    for i, question in enumerate(questions):\n        answer = input(f\"Question {i + 1}: {question}\\nYour answer: \")\n        answers.append(answer)\n    return answers\n\n\ndef main():\n    # List of questions\n    questions = [\n        \"What is your name?\",\n        \"How old are you?\",\n        \"Where are you from?\",\n        # Add more questions as needed\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Please answer the following questions:\")\n    answers = ask_questions(questions)\n\n    # Print out the answers\n    print(\"\\nYour answers:\")\n    for i, (question, answer) in enumerate(zip(questions, answers)):\n        print(f\"Question {i + 1}: {question}\")\n        print(f\"Your answer: {answer}\")\n        print()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `ask_questions` function takes a list of questions as input and iterates over each question.\n2. For each question, it prompts the user to answer using the `input` function.\n3. The user's answer is stored in a list, which is returned at the end of the function.\n4. In the `main` function, a list of questions is defined.\n5. The `ask_questions` function is called with the list of questions, and the user's answers are stored in a list.\n6. Finally, the program prints out the user's answers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and answer the questions when prompted. You can add or remove questions from the `questions` list in the `main` function as needed.\n\nExample output:\n```\nPlease answer the following questions:\nQuestion 1: What is your name?\nYour answer: John\nQuestion 2: How old are you?\nYour answer: 30\nQuestion 3: Where are you from?\nYour answer: New York\n\nYour answers:\nQuestion 1: What is your name?\nYour answer: John\n\nQuestion 2: How old are you?\nYour answer: 30\n\nQuestion 3: Where are you from?\nYour answer: New York\n```",
