  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef filter_list(lst, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the elements from lst that satisfy the condition.\n\n    :param lst: The input list.\n    :param condition: A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n    :return: A new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    new_list = []\n    for element in lst:\n        if condition(element):\n            new_list.append(element)\n    return new_list\n\n# Example usage:\ndef is_even(x):\n    return x % 2 == 0\n\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = filter_list(lst, is_even)\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\nNote that I've included the example usage as per the specifications, which demonstrates how to use the `filter_list` function to filter a list of integers based on the `is_even` condition.",
