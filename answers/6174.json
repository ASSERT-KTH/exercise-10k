  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a reduction as input and returns the result of applying the reduction to all elements in the list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a reduction operation to all elements in a list, providing a clear and step-by-step solution to your problem. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef reduce_list(input_list, reduction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a reduction operation to all elements in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list of elements to be reduced.\n        reduction (function): The reduction function to apply.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of applying the reduction to all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not input_list:\n        raise TypeError('reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value')\n\n    # Initialize the result with the first element of the list\n    # This will be our starting point for the reduction operation\n    result = input_list[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the rest of the list (from the second element to the end)\n    for element in input_list[1:]:\n        # Apply the reduction function to the current result and the current element\n        # The result of this operation will become the new result\n        result = reduction(result, element)\n\n    # After iterating over all elements, return the final result\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nprint(reduce_list(numbers, add))  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `reduce_list` takes two parameters: `input_list` and `reduction`. It first checks if the `input_list` is empty, raising a `TypeError` if it is.\n* It then initializes the `result` variable with the first element of the `input_list` and iterates over the rest of the list, applying the `reduction` function to the current `result` and each element.\n* The `reduction` function is applied cumulatively to the elements of the `input_list`, from left to right, so as to reduce the list to a single output value.\n* Finally, the function returns the final `result` after all elements have been processed.",
