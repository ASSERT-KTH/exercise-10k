  "answer": "**Time Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the time taken to cover a certain distance at a given speed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time(distance, speed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time taken to cover a distance at a given speed.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance to be covered in kilometers.\n        speed (float): The speed at which the distance is covered in kilometers per hour.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The time taken to cover the distance in hours.\n    \"\"\"\n    if speed == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Speed cannot be zero\")\n\n    time = distance / speed\n    return time\n\ndef main():\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance in kilometers: \"))\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed in kilometers per hour: \"))\n\n    try:\n        time = calculate_time(distance, speed)\n        print(f\"The time taken to cover {distance} km at {speed} km/h is {time:.2f} hours\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Calculate the time taken to cover 100 km at a speed of 50 km/h:\n    * Input: `distance = 100`, `speed = 50`\n    * Output: `The time taken to cover 100.0 km at 50.0 km/h is 2.00 hours`\n2. Calculate the time taken to cover 200 km at a speed of 100 km/h:\n    * Input: `distance = 200`, `speed = 100`\n    * Output: `The time taken to cover 200.0 km at 100.0 km/h is 2.00 hours`\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple formula to calculate the time: `time = distance / speed`.\n* The program checks for division by zero and raises a `ValueError` if the speed is zero.\n* The program uses a `main` function to get user input and call the `calculate_time` function.\n* The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any errors that may occur during execution.",
