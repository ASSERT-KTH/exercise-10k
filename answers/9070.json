  "answer": "**Simple Countdown Timer Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that acts as a simple countdown timer, counting down from a given time using if/else statements.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef countdown(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts down from the given time.\n\n    Args:\n        hours (int): The number of hours to count down from.\n        minutes (int): The number of minutes to count down from.\n        seconds (int): The number of seconds to count down from.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n\n    while total_seconds > 0:\n        # Calculate the remaining hours, minutes, and seconds\n        remaining_hours = total_seconds // 3600\n        remaining_minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60\n        remaining_seconds = total_seconds % 60\n\n        # Print the remaining time\n        print(f\"Time remaining: {remaining_hours:02d}:{remaining_minutes:02d}:{remaining_seconds:02d}\", end='\\r')\n\n        # Wait for 1 second\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Decrement the total seconds\n        total_seconds -= 1\n\n    print(\"\\nTime's up!\")\n\ndef main():\n    hours = int(input(\"Enter the number of hours: \"))\n    minutes = int(input(\"Enter the number of minutes: \"))\n    seconds = int(input(\"Enter the number of seconds: \"))\n\n    # Validate the input time\n    if hours < 0 or minutes < 0 or seconds < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Time cannot be negative.\")\n    elif minutes >= 60 or seconds >= 60:\n        print(\"Error: Minutes and seconds must be less than 60.\")\n    else:\n        countdown(hours, minutes, seconds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `countdown` function takes in the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to count down from.\n2. It calculates the total number of seconds from the given time.\n3. The function then enters a loop, where it calculates the remaining hours, minutes, and seconds from the total seconds.\n4. It prints the remaining time and waits for 1 second using the `time.sleep` function.\n5. The loop continues until the total seconds reach 0, at which point it prints \"Time's up!\".\n6. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the number of hours, minutes, and seconds.\n7. The input time is validated to ensure it is not negative and that minutes and seconds are less than 60.\n8. If the input time is valid, the `countdown` function is called with the given time.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nTo use the program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the number of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the number of hours: 0\nEnter the number of minutes: 1\nEnter the number of seconds: 0\nTime remaining: 00:01:00\nTime remaining: 00:00:59\nTime remaining: 00:00:58\n...\nTime's up!\n```",
