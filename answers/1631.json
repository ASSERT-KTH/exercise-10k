  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the sum of the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. It calculates the length of the list using the built-in `len` function.\n5. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the length.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with a sample list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[90, 80, 70, 60, 50]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[25, 30, 35, 40, 45]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of stock prices: `[100, 120, 110, 130, 140]`",
