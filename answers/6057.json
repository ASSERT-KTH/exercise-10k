Each dictionary has keys for the movie's title, genre, and release year.\n\n2. **Search Functions**: The program includes three functions:\n   - `search_by_title()`: Prompts the user for a title and searches for movies with that title (case-insensitive).\n   - `search_by_genre()`: Prompts the user for a genre and searches for movies with that genre (case-insensitive).\n   - `search_by_year()`: Prompts the user for a release year and searches for movies released in that year.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose how to search for movies or exit the program.\n\n4. **User Interaction**: Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding search function. If a user chooses to exit, it prints a farewell message and breaks out of the loop, ending the program.\n\n5. **Search Results**: After searching, the program prints the titles, genres, and release years of the found movies. If no movies match the search criteria, it displays a message indicating that no movies were found.\n\n6. **Running the Program**: The `if __name__ ==",
