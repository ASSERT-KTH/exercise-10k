The `validate_credit_card_number` function takes a credit card number as input and returns True if it is valid, False otherwise.\n2. The function uses the Luhn algorithm to validate the credit card number.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a credit card number, removes any non-digit characters, and then calls the `validate_credit_card_number` function to validate the card number.\n4. The result of the validation is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a valid credit card number, such as 4532015112830366, to see the program print \"The credit card number is valid.\"\n* Enter an invalid credit card number, such as 6011514433546201, to see the program print \"The credit card number is not valid.\"\n\nNote: This program only checks if the credit card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm, it does not check if the card number actually exists or is active.",
