  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The program should handle cases where the input score is not within the range of 0 to 100.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:\n        return \"D\"\n    elif score >= 0 and score <= 59:\n        return \"F\"\n    else:\n        return \"Bad score\"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_grade(100))  # Expected output: A\nprint(calculate_grade(89))   # Expected output: B\nprint(calculate_grade(79))   # Expected output: C\nprint(calculate_grade(69))   # Expected output: D\nprint(calculate_grade(59))   # Expected output: F\nprint(calculate_grade(101))  # Expected output: Bad score\n```\nThis code defines a function `calculate_grade` that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the specified conditions. It uses a series of `if-elif` statements to check the score against each of the grade ranges and returns the corresponding grade. If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, it returns \"Bad score\". The code also includes some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.",
