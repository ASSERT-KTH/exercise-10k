  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string from the user, splits it into words, and prints out the words one per line.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_words_per_line(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string, splits it into words, and prints each word on a new line.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to be split into words.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Print each word on a new line\n    for word in words:\n        print(word)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the string from the user\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Call the function to print words per line\n    print_words_per_line(user_string)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `print_words_per_line` function takes a string input, splits it into words using the `split` method (which splits on whitespace by default), and then iterates over the list of words to print each one.\n- The `main` function gets user input using the built-in `input` function and calls `print_words_per_line` with this input.\n- The program uses a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure the `main` function is called when the script is run directly, but not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case:\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a string. After entering a string and pressing Enter, it will print each word in the string on a new line.\n\nFor example, if you input: \"Hello World this is Python\"\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nHello\nWorld\nthis\nis\nPython\n```",
