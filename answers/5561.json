  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and outputs the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operator):\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n    else:\n        return \"Error: Invalid operator\"\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    \n    result = calculate(num1, num2, operator)\n    print(\"Result: \", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate` function takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an `operator` as input.\n2. **Operation Handling**: It then checks the `operator` and performs the corresponding operation on `num1` and `num2`.\n3. **Error Handling**: It includes basic error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function is used to get the input from the user, call the `calculate` function, and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Addition: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` as the operator. The output will be `15.0`.\n* Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `-` as the operator. The output will be `5.0`.\n* Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` as the operator. The output will be `50.0`.\n* Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` as the operator. The output will be `5.0`.",
