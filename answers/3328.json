  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_elements(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the array.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list.\n        ValueError: If the list contains non-integer values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(array, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if len(array) == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Check if all elements in the list are integers\n    if not all(isinstance(element, int) for element in array):\n        raise ValueError(\"All elements in the list must be integers.\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all elements in the array\n    total_sum = sum(array)\n\n    return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_elements(array)\nprint(\"The sum of all elements in the array is:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `sum_of_elements` takes an array of integers as input and returns their sum.\n*   It first checks if the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.\n*   Then it checks if the list is empty and returns 0 in that case.\n*   It also checks if all elements in the list are integers and raises a `ValueError` if any element is not an integer.\n*   Finally, it calculates the sum of all elements in the array using the built-in `sum` function and returns the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it needs to iterate over all elements in the array to calculate their sum.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input array and the result, regardless of the size of the input array.",
