  "answer": "**Complex Problem: University Course Advisor**\n=============================================\n\nThis program will act as a university course advisor, guiding students in choosing their courses based on their major, semester, and available courses.\n\n**Program Requirements**\n------------------------\n\n* The program should ask for the student's major and semester.\n* Based on the major, it should display the available courses for that major.\n* For each course, it should ask if the student wants to enroll in it.\n* If the student wants to enroll, it should check if the student has the required prerequisites for the course.\n* If the prerequisites are met, it should add the course to the student's schedule.\n\n**Program Implementation**\n-------------------------\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary of courses with their prerequisites\ncourses = {\n    \"Math\": {\n        \"Course1\": {\"name\": \"Calculus\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n        \"Course2\": {\"name\": \"Linear Algebra\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Calculus\"]},\n        \"Course3\": {\"name\": \"Differential Equations\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Linear Algebra\"]}\n    },\n    \"Computer Science\": {\n        \"Course1\": {\"name\": \"Introduction to Programming\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n        \"Course2\": {\"name\": \"Data Structures\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Introduction to Programming\"]},\n        \"Course3\": {\"name\": \"Algorithms\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Data Structures\"]}\n    },\n    \"Engineering\": {\n        \"Course1\": {\"name\": \"Introduction to Engineering\", \"prerequisites\": []},\n        \"Course2\": {\"name\": \"Thermodynamics\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Introduction to Engineering\"]},\n        \"Course3\": {\"name\": \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"prerequisites\": [\"Thermodynamics\"]}\n    }\n}\n\ndef get_major():\n    \"\"\"Ask for the student's major\"\"\"\n    print(\"Available majors:\")\n    for i, major in enumerate(courses.keys()):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {major}\")\n    major_choice = int(input(\"Enter the number of your major: \"))\n    return list(courses.keys())[major_choice - 1]\n\ndef get_semester():\n    \"\"\"Ask for the student's semester\"\"\"\n    print(\"Available semesters:\")\n    for i in range(1, 9):\n        print(f\"{i}.
