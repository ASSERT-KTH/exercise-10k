  "answer": "**String Comparison using Comparison Operators**\n\nIn programming, comparison operators can be used to compare two strings. Here's a breakdown of the comparison operators that can be used:\n\n### Comparison Operators\n\nThe following comparison operators can be used to compare two strings:\n\n* `==` (Equal to)\n* `!=` (Not equal to)\n* `>` (Greater than)\n* `<` (Less than)\n* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)\n* `<=` (Less than or equal to)\n\n### String Comparison Rules\n\nWhen comparing two strings using comparison operators, the following rules apply:\n\n* The comparison is done lexicographically, meaning that the strings are compared character by character from left to right.\n* The characters are compared based on their ASCII values.\n* If a character in one string has a higher ASCII value than the corresponding character in the other string, the first string is considered greater.\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\n# Define two strings\nstr1 = \"Hello\"\nstr2 = \"World\"\n\n# Compare the strings using comparison operators\nprint(\"str1 == str2:\", str1 == str2)\nprint(\"str1 != str2:\", str1 != str2)\nprint(\"str1 > str2:\", str1 > str2)\nprint(\"str1 < str2:\", str1 < str2)\nprint(\"str1 >= str2:\", str1 >= str2)\nprint(\"str1 <= str2:\", str1 <= str2)\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nstr1 == str2: False\nstr1 != str2: True\nstr1 > str2: False\nstr1 < str2: True\nstr1 >= str2: False\nstr1 <= str2: True\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nString comparison can be useful in various scenarios, such as:\n\n* Validating user input (e.g., checking if a username or password matches a expected value)\n* Sorting a list of strings alphabetically\n* Searching for a specific string within a larger text\n\nNote that the comparison operators may not work as expected for strings that contain non-ASCII characters or special characters. In such cases, additional processing may be required to ensure accurate comparison results.",
