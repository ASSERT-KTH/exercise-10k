  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the squares of each number in the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the squares of each number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [n ** 2 for n in numbers]\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    print(\"List with squared numbers:\", squared_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `square_numbers` function uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `square_numbers` by passing a list of numbers, then printing both the original list and the list with squared numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nList with squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```",
