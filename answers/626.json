  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest on a loan.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of the loan.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        time_period (int): The number of years the loan is for.\n        compounding_frequency (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount of the loan after the given time period.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate / compounding_frequency) ** (compounding_frequency * time_period)\n    return total_amount\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    compounding_frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (per year): \"))\n\n    total_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency)\n    interest_earned = total_amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"Total amount after {time_period} years: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the total amount of the loan after the given time period and the interest earned.\n\n### Formula Explanation\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A = total amount\n- P = principal amount\n- r = annual interest rate\n- n = compounding frequency per year\n- t = time period in years\n\nThis program uses this formula to calculate the total amount of the loan after the given time period. The interest earned is then calculated by subtracting the principal amount from the total amount.",
