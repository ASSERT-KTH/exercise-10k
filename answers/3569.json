  "answer": "**Merging Dictionaries Function**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that merges two dictionaries into one. This function uses the built-in `update()` method of Python dictionaries.\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the first dictionary to avoid modifying it in place\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    \n    # Update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    \n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    dict2 = {\"b\": 3, \"c\": 4}\n\n    merged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\n    print(\"Merged Dictionary:\", merged)\n```\n\n**Alternative Method Using Dictionary Unpacking**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nPython 3.5 and later versions also support dictionary unpacking using the `**` operator, which can be used to merge dictionaries in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    dict2 = {\"b\": 3, \"c\": 4}\n\n    merged = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\n    print(\"Merged Dictionary:\", merged)\n```\n\nIn both examples, if there are any duplicate keys between the two dictionaries, the values from the second dictionary (`dict2`) will override those from the first dictionary (`dict1`) in the merged dictionary.",
