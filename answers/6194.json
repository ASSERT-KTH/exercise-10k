  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the substring in the string.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that finds the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string. This function will take two parameters: the original string and the substring to be searched. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef last_occurrence(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The original string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the last occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the substring is empty, in which case we return -1\n    if not substring:\n        return -1\n\n    # We use the rfind method of the string class, which returns the highest index of the substring if it is found\n    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1\n    last_index = string.rfind(substring)\n\n    # We return the last index\n    return last_index\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `last_occurrence` checks if the `substring` is empty. If it is, the function returns -1, indicating that the substring is not found.\n* It uses the `rfind` method of the string class, which returns the highest index of the `substring` if it is found in the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, it returns -1.\n* The result from the `rfind` method is stored in the `last_index` variable and then returned by the function.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of what the function does, explains the parameters it takes, and describes what it returns.",
