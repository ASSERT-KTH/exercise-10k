  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the same elements in reverse order.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a function that reverses the elements of a given list. This function will take a list as input, reverse its elements, and return the new list. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the same elements in reverse order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be reversed.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with the elements of the input list in reverse order.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We will use list slicing to create a new list that is the reverse of the input list\n    # The syntax for list slicing is [start:stop:step], where start is the starting index, \n    # stop is the ending index, and step is the increment between indices\n    # By using ::-1, we are starting at the end of the list and moving backwards to the beginning, \n    # effectively reversing the list\n    reversed_list = input_list[::-1]\n\n    # Now we return the new list\n    return reversed_list\n\n# Test the function\nprint(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `reverse_list` takes an input list `input_list` and uses list slicing (`input_list[::-1]`) to create a new list `reversed_list` that contains the same elements in reverse order.\n* The list slicing syntax `[::-1]` starts at the end of the list and moves backwards to the beginning, effectively reversing the list.\n* The function then returns the new list `reversed_list`.\n* An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to reverse a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result.",
