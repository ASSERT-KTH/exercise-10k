  "answer": "**Sorting a List of Numbers in Ascending Order**\n=====================================================\n\nHere is a simple program written in Python that uses for loops to sort a given list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef sort_list(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a given list of numbers in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): The list of numbers to sort.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Make a copy of the original list to avoid modifying it in place\n    sorted_numbers = numbers[:]\n\n    # Iterate over the list\n    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers)):\n        # Iterate over the unsorted portion of the list\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(sorted_numbers)):\n            # If the current number is greater than the next number, swap them\n            if sorted_numbers[i] > sorted_numbers[j]:\n                sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[j] = sorted_numbers[j], sorted_numbers[i]\n\n    return sorted_numbers\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    sorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `sort_list` function takes a list of numbers as input and makes a copy of it to avoid modifying the original list.\n2. The function uses two nested for loops to iterate over the list. The outer loop iterates over each number in the list, and the inner loop iterates over the unsorted portion of the list.\n3. Inside the inner loop, the function checks if the current number is greater than the next number. If it is, the function swaps the two numbers.\n4. The function returns the sorted list of numbers.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this sorting algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list. This is because the algorithm uses two nested loops to iterate over the list.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis sorting algorithm is not the most efficient way to sort a list of numbers, especially for large lists. For larger lists, it's recommended to use more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n).",
