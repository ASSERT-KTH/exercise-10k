  "answer": "**Hangman Game Program**\n==========================\n\n### Game Description\n\nHangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's gallows is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed or the gallows is complete and the player who is guessing the word is \"hanged.\"\n\n### Program Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nHANGMAN_PICS = ['''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n /    |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n / \\  |\n      |\n=========''']\n\nWORDS = 'ant baboon badger bat bear beaver camel cat clam cobra cougar coyote crow deer dog donkey duck eagle ferret fox frog goat goose hawk lion lizard llama mole monkey moose mouse mule newt otter owl panda parrot pigeon python rabbit ram rat raven rhino salmon seal shark sheep skunk sloth snake spider stork swan tiger toad trout turkey turtle weasel whale wolf wombat zebra'.split()\n\ndef getRandomWord(wordList):\n    # This function returns a random string from the passed list of strings.\n    wordIndex = random.randint(0, len(wordList) - 1)\n    return wordList[wordIndex]\n\ndef displayBoard(HANGMAN_PICS, missedLetters, correctLetters, secretWord):\n    print(HANGMAN_PICS[len(missedLetters)])\n    print()\n\n    print('Missed letters:', end=' ')\n    for letter in missedLetters:\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\n    blanks = '_' * len(secretWord)\n\n    for i in range(len(secretWord)): # replace blanks with correctly guessed letters\n        if secretWord[i] in correctLetters:\n            blanks = blanks[:i] + secretWord[i] + blanks[i+1:]\n\n    for letter in blanks: # show the secret word with spaces in between each letter\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\ndef getGuess(alreadyGuessed):\n    # Returns the letter the player entered.
