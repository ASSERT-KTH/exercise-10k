  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the maximum and minimum of two given numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_max_min(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the maximum and minimum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the maximum and minimum of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_num = max(num1, num2)\n    min_num = min(num1, num2)\n    \n    return max_num, min_num\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the maximum and minimum\n    max_num, min_num = calculate_max_min(num1, num2)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Maximum: {max_num}\")\n    print(f\"Minimum: {min_num}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_max_min` function takes two numbers as arguments and uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to calculate the maximum and minimum.\n2. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calls `calculate_max_min` to calculate the maximum and minimum, and then prints the results.\n3. The program uses a `main` function to encapsulate the main logic and an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block to ensure the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. After you enter the numbers, it will print the maximum and minimum of the two numbers. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 20\nMaximum: 20.0\nMinimum: 10.0\n```",
