  "answer": "**Basic User Query Response Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program is designed to respond to basic user queries such as greetings, well-being, and identity.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass QueryResponder:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def respond(self, query):\n        query = query.lower()\n\n        if \"hello\" in query or \"hi\" in query:\n            return self.greet()\n        elif \"how are you\" in query:\n            return self.check_wellbeing()\n        elif \"what is your name\" in query:\n            return self.introduce()\n        else:\n            return \"I'm not sure I understand your query.\"\n\n    def greet(self):\n        greetings = [\"Hello!\", \"Hi!\", \"Hey!\", \"Hello there!\"]\n        return random.choice(greetings)\n\n    def check_wellbeing(self):\n        wellbeing_responses = [\"I'm doing great, thanks!\", \"I'm fine, thanks!\", \"I'm just a program, I don't have feelings, but thanks for asking!\"]\n        return random.choice(wellbeing_responses)\n\n    def introduce(self):\n        return f\"My name is {self.name}.\"\n\ndef main():\n    responder = QueryResponder(\"Llama\")\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the query responder program!\")\n    while True:\n        query = input(\"You: \")\n        response = responder.respond(query)\n        print(f\"{responder.name}: {response}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The program uses a `QueryResponder` class to handle user queries.\n*   The `respond` method checks the user's query and returns a response based on the query type.\n*   The `greet`, `check_wellbeing`, and `introduce` methods provide random responses for greetings, well-being, and identity queries, respectively.\n*   In the `main` function, a `QueryResponder` instance is created, and the program enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input and displays the response.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   Greeting: User inputs \"hello\", and the program responds with a random greeting.\n*   Well-being: User inputs \"how are you\", and the program responds with a random wellbeing response.\n*   Identity: User inputs \"what is your name\", and the program responds with its name.\n\n### Running the Program\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `query_responder.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python query_responder.py`). Then, interact with the program by typing queries, and it will respond accordingly.",
