  "answer": "**Calculating Total Amount to Pay**\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that asks the user for the total bill and the tip percentage, then calculates and prints the total amount to pay.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_amount():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for the total bill and the tip percentage, \n    then calculates and prints the total amount to pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the total bill from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill: $\"))\n            if total_bill < 0:\n                print(\"The total bill cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n            if tip_percentage < 0:\n                print(\"The tip percentage cannot be negative.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the total amount to pay\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * total_bill\n    total_amount = total_bill + tip_amount\n\n    # Print the total amount to pay\n    print(f\"Total bill: ${total_bill:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip ({tip_percentage}%): ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount to pay: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_total_amount()\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. Asks the user for the total bill and validates the input to ensure it's a non-negative number.\n2. Asks the user for the tip percentage and validates the input to ensure it's a non-negative number.\n3. Calculates the tip amount by multiplying the total bill by the tip percentage.\n4. Calculates the total amount to pay by adding the total bill and the tip amount.\n5. Prints the total bill, tip amount, and total amount to pay.\n\nExample usage:\n```\nEnter the total bill: $100\nEnter the tip percentage (%): 15\nTotal bill: $100.00\nTip (15.0%): $15.00\nTotal amount to pay: $115.00\n```",
