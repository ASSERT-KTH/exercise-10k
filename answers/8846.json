  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n    try:\n        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    except TypeError:\n        raise TypeError(\"List must only contain numeric values\")\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average` takes a list of numbers as input and checks if it is a list.\n2. It then checks if the list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It attempts to calculate the average by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the length of the list.\n4. If the list contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` is raised.\n5. The function returns the calculated average.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the average of a list of exam scores\n* Finding the average price of a list of items\n* Determining the average value of a list of measurements",
