  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space.\n\n    Args:\n    point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x, y).\n    point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples representing the coordinates of two points in a 2D space.\n2. It uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the two points: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2).\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n4. The program prints the calculated distance to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two cities on a map.\n* Determine the distance between two objects in a simulation.\n* Measure the distance between two points in a graphical user interface.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Use this program as a starting point for more complex geometric calculations.\n* Consider adding error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric coordinates).\n* Experiment with different distance formulas (e.g., Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance) for specific use cases.",
