  "answer": "**Merging Two Dictionaries**\n================================\n\nHere is a Python function that merges two dictionaries into a new dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n\n# Example usage\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nmerged_dict = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\nprint(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n```\n\nThis function uses dictionary unpacking (`**`) to merge the two input dictionaries into a new dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will overwrite the values from the first dictionary.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can also use the `update()` method to merge the two dictionaries:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a copy of the first dictionary and then updates it with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary.\n\n**Note**: In Python 3.5 and later, you can use the `dict()` constructor with the `**` operator to merge dictionaries, like this: `dict(**dict1, **dict2)`. However, this is less readable and less efficient than the `**` operator used in the first implementation.",
