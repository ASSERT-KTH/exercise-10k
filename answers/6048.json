  "answer": "Here's a Python program that simulates a bank account using conditional statements:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.balance = 0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance}.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. Your new balance is ${self.balance}.\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.

Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. The `main` function provides a simple text-based menu for users to interact with their bank account.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The `BankAccount` class is initialized with a balance of 0.\n2.  **Deposit**: The `deposit` method checks if the deposit amount is positive. If valid, it adds the amount to the balance and displays the new balance.\n3.  **Withdrawal**: The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance. If valid, it subtracts the amount from the balance and displays the new balance. Otherwise, it displays an error message.\n4.  **Balance Check**: The `check_balance` method simply displays the current balance.\n5.  **Menu**: The `main` function presents a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit the program. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding method and handles invalid inputs.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Choose option 1 to deposit an amount (e.g., 1000).\n3.  Choose option 2 to withdraw an amount (e.g., 500).\n4.  Choose option 3 to check your balance.\n5.  Choose option 4 to exit the program.\n\nThis program demonstrates a basic bank account simulator using conditional statements to handle different user interactions.",
