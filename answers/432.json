  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The user can choose to play a single round or multiple rounds.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef play_round():\n    \"\"\"Plays a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid input.

Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n4. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n5. In multiple rounds, the final score will be displayed at the end of the game.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to determine the computer's choice. In a real-world application, you may want to use a more secure random number generator.",
