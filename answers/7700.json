  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Squares**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python function that calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([n ** 2 for n in numbers])\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `sum_of_squares` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to square each number in the list.\n3. The built-in `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the squared numbers.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n### Alternative Solution\nYou can also use the `map` function to achieve the same result:\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    return sum(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n```\nThis solution is more concise but may be less readable for those unfamiliar with the `map` function.",
