  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n\nHere's a Python implementation of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Check for negative input\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number must be non-negative.\")\n    \n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.\n*   For negative inputs, the function raises a `ValueError` since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   The recursive case calculates the factorial by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number.",
