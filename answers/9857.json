  "answer": "**Student Pass/Fail Checker**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. If the grade is above 50, the student has passed. Otherwise, they have failed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (int): The student's grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: \"Passed\" if the grade is above 50, \"Failed\" otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade > 50:\n        return \"Passed\"\n    else:\n        return \"Failed\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    grade = int(input(\"Enter the student's grade: \"))\n    result = check_grade(grade)\n    print(f\"The student has {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_grade` function takes an integer `grade` as input and returns a string indicating whether the student has passed or failed.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a grade, checks the grade using the `check_grade` function, and prints the result.\n3. The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine the result based on the grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a grade above 50 (e.g., 60) to see the \"Passed\" result.\n* Enter a grade below or equal to 50 (e.g., 40) to see the \"Failed\" result.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `grade_checker.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python grade_checker.py`).\n3. Follow the prompt to enter a grade and see the result.",
