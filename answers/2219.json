  "answer": "**Credit Card Validator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses the Luhn algorithm to check the validity of a credit card number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any non-digit characters from the card number\n    card_number = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, card_number))\n\n    # Check if the card number is empty or has less than 13 digits\n    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 16:\n        return False\n\n    # Convert the card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(x) for x in card_number]\n\n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n\n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n\n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    return sum(card_number) % 10 == 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    card_number = input(\"Enter a credit card number: \")\n    if validate_credit_card(card_number):\n        print(\"Valid credit card\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid credit card\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `validate_credit_card` function takes a credit card number as input and removes any non-digit characters.\n2. It checks if the card number has between 13 and 16 digits (the standard length for most credit cards).\n3. The function then converts the card number to a list of integers and reverses the list.\n4. Every second digit is doubled, and if the result is greater than 9, 9 is subtracted from it.\n5. The function returns True if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, indicating a valid credit card number.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a credit card number and prints whether the number is valid or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a valid credit card number, such as `4111111111111111`, to see the \"Valid credit card\" message.\n* Enter an invalid credit card number, such as `1234567890123456`, to see the \"Invalid credit card\" message.",
