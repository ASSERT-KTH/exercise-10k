  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that inverts a dictionary and returns a new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs. This function will handle cases where the original dictionary has multiple keys mapping to the same value. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef invert_dictionary(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function inverts a dictionary and returns a new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs.\n    \n    If the original dictionary has multiple keys mapping to the same value, \n    the resulting dictionary will have a list of these keys as its value.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be inverted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the inverted key-value pairs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inverted key-value pairs\n    inverted_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the original dictionary\n    for key, value in dictionary.items():\n        # If the value is not already a key in the inverted dictionary, add it with the original key as its value\n        if value not in inverted_dict:\n            # Comment: We use a list to store the original keys in case there are multiple keys with the same value\n            inverted_dict[value] = [key]\n        else:\n            # If the value is already a key in the inverted dictionary, append the original key to its list of values\n            inverted_dict[value].append(key)\n\n    # Return the inverted dictionary\n    return inverted_dict\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}\nprint(invert_dictionary(original_dict))  # Output: {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `invert_dictionary` initializes an empty dictionary `inverted_dict` to store the inverted key-value pairs from the input dictionary.\n*   It iterates over each key-value pair in the original dictionary using a `for` loop. If a value from the original dictionary is not already a key in `inverted_dict`, it adds this value as a key with the corresponding original key as its value in a list.\n*   If a value from the original dictionary is already a key in `inverted_dict`, it appends the original key to the list of values for that key in `inverted_dict`.\n*   Finally, the function returns `inverted_dict`, which contains the inverted key-value pairs from the original dictionary.",
