  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name and an age as input, with the age defaulting to 25 if not provided.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a name and an age as input, with the age defaulting to a specific value if not provided. This function will be designed to handle both cases where the age is provided and where it is not. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# Define a function with name and age as parameters, defaulting age to 25 if not provided\ndef create_person(name, age=25):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a person object with a name and an age.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person.\n        age (int, optional): The age of the person. Defaults to 25.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary representing the person.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the name is a string and the age is an integer\n    if not isinstance(name, str) or not isinstance(age, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Name must be a string and age must be an integer.\")\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the person's information\n    person = {\n        # Store the name in the dictionary\n        \"name\": name,\n        # Store the age in the dictionary\n        \"age\": age\n    }\n    \n    # Return the person dictionary\n    return person\n\n# Test the function\nprint(create_person(\"John\"))\nprint(create_person(\"Jane\", 30))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `create_person` function is defined with `name` and `age` as parameters, where `age` defaults to 25 if not provided. This is achieved by setting `age=25` in the function definition.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed to ensure that `name` is a string and `age` is an integer. If either condition is not met, a `TypeError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* A dictionary named `person` is created to store the person's information, with keys for `name` and `age`. This dictionary is then returned by the function.\n* Example usage of the function is demonstrated by creating two people, one with the default age and another with a specified age, and printing the resulting dictionaries.",
