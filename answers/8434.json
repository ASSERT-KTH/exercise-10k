  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a score and outputs the corresponding grade using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses conditional statements to determine a grade based on a score:\n\n```python\ndef determine_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines a grade based on a score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score to determine the grade for.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade for the score.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\"\n\n    # Determine the grade based on the score\n    elif score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n    # Determine and print the grade\n    print(\"Your grade is:\", determine_grade(score))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `determine_grade` function takes a score as input and checks if it is valid (between 0 and 100).\n2. If the score is valid, the function uses a series of `elif` statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n3. The grade is then returned by the function.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter their score.\n5. The `determine_grade` function is called with the user's score, and the resulting grade is printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a score of 95, the program will output \"Your grade is: A\".\n* If the user enters a score of 75, the program will output \"Your grade is: C\".\n* If the user enters a score of -1, the program will output \"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\".",
