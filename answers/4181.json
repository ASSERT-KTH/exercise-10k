  "answer": "**Mathematical Operation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef perform_operation(operation, num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a mathematical operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        operation (str): The mathematical operation to perform. Supported operations are '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not supported.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation\")\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    print(perform_operation('+', 10, 5))  # Output: 15\n    print(perform_operation('-', 10, 5))  # Output: 5\n    print(perform_operation('*', 10, 5))  # Output: 50\n    print(perform_operation('/', 10, 5))  # Output: 2.0\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `perform_operation` function takes in three parameters: `operation`, `num1`, and `num2`.\n*   It uses if-elif-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the `operation` parameter.\n*   For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   If the operation is not supported, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `perform_operation` function.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This implementation supports basic arithmetic operations. You can extend it to support more complex operations or use a library like `operator` for more concise code.\n*   Consider adding input validation for the numbers to ensure they are valid numeric values.\n*   You can also use a dictionary to map operations to their corresponding functions for a more scalable and readable implementation.",
