  "answer": "**Change Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the change amount based on the payment and total bill provided by the user.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(total_bill, payment):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the change amount based on the payment and total bill.\n\n    Args:\n        total_bill (float): The total bill amount.\n        payment (float): The payment amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The change amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if payment < total_bill:\n        return \"Insufficient payment. Please pay the full amount.\"\n    else:\n        return payment - total_bill\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the total bill and payment from the user\n    total_bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill amount: $\"))\n    payment = float(input(\"Enter the payment amount: $\"))\n\n    # Calculate the change amount\n    change = calculate_change(total_bill, payment)\n\n    # Print the change amount\n    if isinstance(change, str):\n        print(change)\n    else:\n        print(f\"Change: ${change:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the total bill amount when prompted (e.g., `100.00`).\n3. Enter the payment amount when prompted (e.g., `120.00`).\n4. The program will calculate and print the change amount (e.g., `Change: $20.00`).\n\n### Note\n\n* This program assumes that the total bill and payment amounts are non-negative.\n* The program uses a simple subtraction to calculate the change amount.\n* The `calculate_change` function returns a string if the payment is insufficient, and a float otherwise.\n* The `main` function gets the user input, calculates the change amount, and prints the result.",
