  "prompt": "Write a function to sort a dictionary by its keys.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function to sort a dictionary by its keys, making it easier to organize and work with your data. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_keys(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sorts a dictionary by its keys.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary sorted by its keys.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a dictionary. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary.\")\n\n    # We use the built-in sorted function to sort the dictionary items based on their keys.\n    # The sorted function returns a new list containing all items from the dictionary in ascending order of their keys.\n    sorted_items = sorted(input_dict.items())\n\n    # We then use the dict function to convert the sorted list back into a dictionary.\n    # In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain the insertion order, so this will result in a sorted dictionary.\n    sorted_dict = dict(sorted_items)\n\n    # Finally, we return the sorted dictionary.\n    return sorted_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}\nsorted_my_dict = sort_dict_by_keys(my_dict)\nprint(sorted_my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sort_dict_by_keys` starts by validating the input using `isinstance(input_dict, dict)`, ensuring it's a dictionary to avoid potential errors.\n* It then utilizes the built-in `sorted` function to sort the dictionary items based on their keys, which are accessed through the `items()` method of the dictionary.\n* The sorted items are converted back into a dictionary using the `dict()` function, which in Python 3.7 and later maintains the insertion order, resulting in a sorted dictionary.\n* Finally, the function returns the sorted dictionary, providing the desired output in an organized manner.",
