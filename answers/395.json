  "answer": "**Mean Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the mean of a set of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean of a set of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The mean of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    print(f\"The mean of {numbers} is {mean}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their mean.\n2. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n3. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_mean` function.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file (e.g., `mean_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python mean_calculator.py`).\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe mean of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle potential errors, such as division by zero if the input list is empty.\n* Consider adding input validation to ensure that the input list contains only numbers.",
