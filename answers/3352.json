  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to check if a given phone number is valid (10 digits, starts with a digit between 2 and 9).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that checks the validity of a given phone number using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_phone_number(phone_number):\n    # Check if phone number has 10 digits\n    if len(phone_number) != 10:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if phone number starts with a digit between 2 and 9\n    if not 2 <= int(phone_number[0]) <= 9:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if all characters are digits\n    for digit in phone_number:\n        if not digit.isdigit():\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nphone_number = input(\"Enter a phone number: \")\nif is_valid_phone_number(phone_number):\n    print(\"Phone number is valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Phone number is not valid\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `is_valid_phone_number` function checks if a given phone number is valid.\n- It first checks if the length of the phone number is 10.\n- Then, it checks if the first digit is between 2 and 9.\n- After that, it uses a for loop to check if all characters in the phone number are digits.\n- If all checks pass, the function returns `True`, indicating that the phone number is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`. \n\nYou can enter a phone number when prompted to test the code. \n\nRemember, this is a very basic phone number validation and does not cover all possible valid phone number formats (e.g., it does not handle international phone numbers or phone numbers with special characters like +, -, etc.).",
