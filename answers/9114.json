  "prompt": "Write a program to print a pattern of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input provided by the user. The pattern should be printed using a for loop. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program should print: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that satisfies the provided specifications:\n\n```python\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Program: Print numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    print(i, end=\" \")\n```\n\nNote: You should replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name in the comment.\n\nThis program will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by a space, where `n` is the input provided by the user. For example, if the user inputs `5`, the output will be `1 2 3 4 5`.",
