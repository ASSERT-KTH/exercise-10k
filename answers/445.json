The program starts by asking the user for two numbers, `num1` and `num2`. It uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user enters something that can't be converted to a number.\n2. Next, it asks the user for an operator. It checks if the operator is one of the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, \\*, /).\n3. Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on `num1` and `num2`.\n4. If the operator is '/', it checks if `num2` is not zero before performing the division to avoid a division by zero error.\n5. Finally, it prints the result of the operation.\n6. If the user enters an invalid operator or attempts to divide by zero, it prints an error message and returns without printing a result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Addition: Enter `5` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `+` as the operator. The program will print `The result of 5.0 + 3.0 is 8.0.`\n* Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `4` as the second number, and `-` as the operator. The program will print `The result of 10.0 - 4.0 is 6.0.`\n* Multiplication: Enter `7` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `*` as the operator. The program will print `The result of 7.0 * 2.0 is 14.0.`\n* Division: Enter `9` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `/` as the operator. The program will print `The result of 9.0 / 3.0 is 3.0.`",
