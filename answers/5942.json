  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides a hint, such as 'too high' or 'too low', to help the user narrow down their next guess.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `guessing_game` function. The program will guide the user through the game, asking for their guesses and providing hints until the user correctly guesses the number or decides to quit.\n\n```\nWelcome to the random number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nToo low!\nTake a guess: 75\nToo high!\nTake a guess: 67\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
