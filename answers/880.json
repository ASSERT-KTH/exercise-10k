The program should take in the book title and output the updated book list based on the following conditions: if the user checks out a book, remove the book from the list, if the user returns a book, add the book to the list, if the user checks the book list, output the current book list.",

Run the program.\n2.  The library will be initialized with three books: \"Book 1\", \"Book 2\", and \"Book 3\".\n3.  Choose an option from the menu:\n    *   Check out a book: Enter the title of the book you want to check out (e.g., \"Book 1\").\n    *   Return a book: Enter the title of the book you want to return (e.g., \"Book 1\").\n    *   Check book list: View the current book list.\n    *   Exit: Quit the program.",
