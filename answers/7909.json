  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should prompt the user to enter their name, store the input in a variable, and then use that variable to construct the greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Creation Date: [Today's Date]\n# Purpose: To create a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message.\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nprint(\"Hello,\" + name)\n```\nNote that I've left the author and creation date fields blank, as you'll need to fill those in yourself. Also, I've assumed that the `input` function is available in the programming environment, which is typically the case in Python and other modern programming languages. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
