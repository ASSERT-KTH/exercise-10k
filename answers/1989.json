  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that converts time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_24_hour(time_12_hour):\n    components = time_12_hour.split()\n    time = components[0].split(\":\")\n    hours = int(time[0])\n    minutes = int(time[1])\n    seconds = int(time[2])\n    period = components[1]\n\n    if period == \"AM\":\n        if hours == 12:\n            hours = 0\n    else:\n        if hours != 12:\n            hours += 12\n\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}\"\n\n# Example usage:\ntime_12_hour = \"12:30:00 PM\"\nprint(f\"12-hour time: {time_12_hour}\")\nprint(f\"24-hour time: {convert_to_24_hour(time_12_hour)}\")\n\ntime_12_hour = \"06:30:00 AM\"\nprint(f\"\\n12-hour time: {time_12_hour}\")\nprint(f\"24-hour time: {convert_to_24_hour(time_12_hour)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   This program defines a function called `convert_to_24_hour` that takes a string representing a time in 12-hour format as input.\n*   The function splits the input string into components, separating the time from the period (AM/PM).\n*   It further splits the time into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n*   Based on the period, the function applies conditional logic to adjust the hours:\n    *   If the period is AM and the hours are 12, it sets the hours to 0 (since 12:00 AM in 24-hour format is 00:00).\n    *   If the period is PM and the hours are not 12, it adds 12 to the hours to convert them to 24-hour format.\n*   Finally, the function returns the time in 24-hour format as a string, ensuring that the hours, minutes, and seconds are padded with zeros if necessary.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\n12-hour time: 12:30:00 PM\n24-hour time: 12:30:00\n\n12-hour time: 06:30:00 AM\n24-hour time: 06:30:00\n```",
