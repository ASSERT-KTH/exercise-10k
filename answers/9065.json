  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints a sequence of numbers based on a given pattern using if/else statements.\n\n```python\ndef print_sequence(n):\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz\")\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Buzz\")\n        else:\n            print(i)\n\n# Test the function\nprint_sequence(20)\n```\n\nThis program uses the classic FizzBuzz pattern, where:\n\n- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints \"FizzBuzz\"\n- If a number is divisible by 3, it prints \"Fizz\"\n- If a number is divisible by 5, it prints \"Buzz\"\n- If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.\n\nThe `print_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the sequence up to `n`.\n\nYou can replace the `print_sequence(20)` line with any other number to test the function with a different sequence length.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `print_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. For each number `i` in the loop, the function checks the following conditions:\n   - If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints \"FizzBuzz\".\n   - If `i` is divisible by 3, it prints \"Fizz\".\n   - If `i` is divisible by 5, it prints \"Buzz\".\n   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints the number `i` itself.\n\n**Example output:**\n\nWhen you run the program with `print_sequence(20)`, it will print the FizzBuzz sequence up to 20, like this:\n```\n1\n2\nFizz\n4\nBuzz\nFizz\n7\n8\nFizz\nBuzz\n11\nFizz\n13\n14\nFizzBuzz\n16\n17\nFizz\n19\nBuzz\n```",
