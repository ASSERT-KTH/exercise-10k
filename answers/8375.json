  "prompt": "Write a program that generates an arithmetic progression of a given length with a given common difference.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates an arithmetic progression:\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_progression(length, common_difference, start=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an arithmetic progression of a given length with a given common difference.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the arithmetic progression.\n        common_difference (int): The common difference of the arithmetic progression.\n        start (int, optional): The starting value of the arithmetic progression. Defaults to 0.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the arithmetic progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [start + i * common_difference for i in range(length)]\n\n# Example usage:\nlength = 10\ncommon_difference = 2\nstart = 1\n\nprogression = generate_arithmetic_progression(length, common_difference, start)\nprint(\"Arithmetic Progression:\")\nprint(progression)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_arithmetic_progression` function takes three parameters: `length`, `common_difference`, and `start`.\n*   The `start` parameter is optional and defaults to 0 if not provided.\n*   The function uses a list comprehension to generate the arithmetic progression.\n*   The list comprehension iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to `length - 1` and calculates each term in the progression using the formula `start + i * common_difference`.\n*   The resulting list of integers is returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we call the `generate_arithmetic_progression` function with a length of 10, a common difference of 2, and a starting value of 1.\n*   The generated arithmetic progression is then printed to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nArithmetic Progression:\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]\n```",
