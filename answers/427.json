Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the trivia game!\")\n    play_game(trivia_questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Program**\n---------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file called `trivia_game.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type `python trivia_game.py` to run the program.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you a series of trivia questions.
