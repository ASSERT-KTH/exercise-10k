  "answer": "**Simple Quiz Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses an if/else statement to administer a simple quiz based on user input.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\",\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n    \"What is the largest mammal on Earth?\": \"Blue whale\"\n}\n\ndef run_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Run the quiz and check user answers.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, answer in questions.items():\n        user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    run_quiz(quiz_questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `quiz_questions` with quiz questions as keys and correct answers as values.\n2. The `run_quiz` function takes the quiz questions dictionary as input and iterates over each question.\n3. For each question, it prompts the user for an answer using the `input` function.\n4. It checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer (case-insensitive) using an if/else statement.\n5. If the user's answer is correct, it increments the score and prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message with the correct answer.\n6. After all questions have been asked, it prints the final score.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question when prompted.\n3. The program will display the correct answers and your final score at the end.",
