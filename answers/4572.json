  "answer": "**Symmetric Dictionary Difference Function**\n\nHere's a Python function that calculates the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n    \n    Args:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing key-value pairs that exist in either dictionary but not in both.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the symmetric difference of the dictionary keys\n    diff_keys = set(dict1.keys()) ^ set(dict2.keys())\n    \n    # Initialize the result dictionary\n    result = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the keys in dict1 and add them to the result if they are in the diff_keys\n    for key in dict1:\n        if key in diff_keys:\n            result[key] = dict1[key]\n    \n    # Iterate over the keys in dict2 and add them to the result if they are in the diff_keys\n    for key in dict2:\n        if key in diff_keys:\n            result[key] = dict2[key]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nprint(symmetric_dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n```\n\n**Alternative Implementation Using Dictionary Comprehensions**\n\nHere's an alternative implementation using dictionary comprehensions.\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference between two dictionaries.\n    \n    Args:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing key-value pairs that exist in either dictionary but not in both.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the symmetric difference of the dictionary keys\n    diff_keys = set(dict1.keys()) ^ set(dict2.keys())\n    \n    # Use dictionary comprehensions to create the result dictionary\n    result = {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key in diff_keys}\n    result.update({key: dict2[key] for key in dict2 if key in diff_keys})\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nprint(symmetric_dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n```\n\n**Handling Key Collisions**\n\nNote that in the case of key collisions (i.e., when a key exists in both dictionaries but with different values), the above implementation will include the key-value pair from `dict2` in the result. If you want to handle key collisions differently, you can modify the implementation accordingly.\n\n**Output**\n\nFor the example usage, the output will be:\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'd': 5, 'c': 4}\n```",
