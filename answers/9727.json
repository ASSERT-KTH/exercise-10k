  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their median.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the median of a list of numbers. This program uses the built-in `statistics` module, which has a `median` function that can be used to calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n```Python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return statistics.median(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nprint(\"Median:\", calculate_median(numbers))\n```\n\nIn this program, we first import the `statistics` module. Then we define a function `calculate_median` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their median. Inside this function, we use the `statistics.median` function to calculate the median.\n\nIf you want to implement the median calculation manually without using the `statistics` module, you can use the following program:\n\n```Python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list of numbers\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle number\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers\n    else:\n        return (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nprint(\"Median:\", calculate_median(numbers))\n```\n\nThis program sorts the list of numbers and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the list is odd or even. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.",
