  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n==========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        # Swap a and b, and replace b with the remainder of a divided by b\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2}: {calculate_gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_gcd` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n*   It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD, which involves repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n*   The GCD is then the absolute value of `a`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_gcd` with example numbers.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the code with the example numbers, it will output:\n\n```\nGCD of 48 and 18: 6\n```",
