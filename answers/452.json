  "answer": "**Game of Life Simulator**\n================================\n\nThe Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\n**Rules**\n--------\n\nThe universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n\n1.  **Survival**: Every cell that has two or three live neighbours survives.\n2.  **Death by isolation**: Each cell with one or zero live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n3.  **Death by overcrowding**: Each cell with four or more live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4.  **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n**Implementation**\n----------------\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of the Game of Life simulator using the Pygame library for visualization.\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Window dimensions\nWIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 800\n\n# Cell size\nCELL_SIZE = 10\n\n# Colors\nALIVE_COLOR = (255, 255, 255)\nDEAD_COLOR = (0, 0, 0)\n\nclass GameOfLife:\n    def __init__(self, width, height, cell_size):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n        self.cell_size = cell_size\n        self.grid = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(height // cell_size, width // cell_size), p=[0.5, 0.5])\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        screen.fill(DEAD_COLOR)\n        for i in range(self.grid.shape[0]):\n            for j in range(self.grid.shape[1]):\n                if self.grid[i, j] == 1:\n                    pygame.draw.rect(screen, ALIVE_COLOR, (j * self.cell_size, i * self.cell_size, self.cell_size, self.cell_size))\n\n    def update(self):\n        new_grid = np.copy(self.grid)\n        for i in range(self.grid.shape[0]):\n            for j in range(self.grid.shape[1]):\n                live_neighbours = self.count_live_neighbours(i, j)\n                if self.grid[i, j] == 1:\n                    if live_neighbours < 2 or live_neighbours > 3:\n                        new_grid[i, j] = 0\n                else:\n                    if live_neighbours == 3:\n                        new_grid[i, j] = 1\n        self.grid = new_grid\n\n    def count_live_neighbours(self, i, j):\n        count = 0\n        for x in range(-1, 2):\n            for y in range(-1, 2):\n                col = (j + y + self.grid.shape[1]) % self.grid.shape[1]\n                row = (i + x + self.grid.shape[0]) % self.grid.shape[0]\n                count += self.grid[row, col]\n        count -= self.grid[i, j]\n        return count\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))\n    clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n    game = GameOfLife(WIDTH, HEIGHT, CELL_SIZE)\n\n    running = True\n    while running:\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                running = False\n\n        game.draw(screen)\n        pygame.display.flip()\n        game.update()\n        clock.tick(60)\n\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo run the Game of Life simulator, simply execute the `main` function. The simulator will display a window with a random initial configuration of live and dead cells. The game will evolve according to the rules of the Game of Life, and the window will update in real-time to show the current state of the game.\n\nYou can adjust the `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, and `CELL_SIZE` variables to change the size of the window and the cells. You can also modify the `ALIVE_COLOR` and `DEAD_COLOR` variables to change the colors used to represent live and dead cells.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n*   To create a specific initial configuration, you can modify the `grid` attribute of the `GameOfLife` class. For example, you can set `grid` to a numpy array with a specific pattern of live and dead cells.\n*   To add user input to the game, you can modify the `main` function to handle mouse clicks or keyboard input. For example, you can add a feature to allow the user to click on a cell to toggle its state.\n*   To optimize the performance of",
