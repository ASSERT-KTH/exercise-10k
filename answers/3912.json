  "answer": "**Employee Salary Calculator Program**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the salary of an employee given their annual salary and the number of months they have worked.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_salary(annual_salary, months_worked):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the salary of an employee given their annual salary and number of months worked.\n\n    Args:\n        annual_salary (float): The annual salary of the employee.\n        months_worked (int): The number of months the employee has worked.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated salary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the monthly salary\n    monthly_salary = annual_salary / 12\n\n    # Calculate the total salary\n    total_salary = monthly_salary * months_worked\n\n    return total_salary\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the annual salary from the user\n    annual_salary = float(input(\"Enter the annual salary: \"))\n\n    # Get the number of months worked from the user\n    months_worked = int(input(\"Enter the number of months worked: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the salary\n    salary = calculate_salary(annual_salary, months_worked)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The employee's salary is: ${salary:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_salary` that takes two arguments: `annual_salary` and `months_worked`.\n2. The function calculates the monthly salary by dividing the annual salary by 12.\n3. The function then calculates the total salary by multiplying the monthly salary by the number of months worked.\n4. The `main` function gets the annual salary and number of months worked from the user using the `input` function.\n5. The `main` function calls the `calculate_salary` function with the user-input values and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts:\n\n```\nEnter the annual salary: 50000\nEnter the number of months worked: 6\nThe employee's salary is: $25000.00\n```\n\nThis program calculates the salary of an employee who has worked 6 months out of a year with an annual salary of $50,000. The result is $25,000.00.",
