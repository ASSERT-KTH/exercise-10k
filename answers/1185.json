  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n    year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a year that is a leap year (e.g. 2020). The program should output: \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Run the program and enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g. 2021). The program should output: \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function checks if the year is divisible by 4.\n2. If the year is divisible by 4, it then checks if the year is a century year (i.e. divisible by 100).\n3. If the year is a century year, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.\n4. The `main` function gets the year from the user, checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.",
