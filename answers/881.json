  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. If the user's guess is higher than the number, print 'Too high'. If the guess is lower, print 'Too low'. If the guess is correct, print 'Congratulations!' and end the program.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")\n\n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We first import the `random` module, which provides functionality for generating random numbers.\n*   The `guess_number` function generates a random number between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)`.\n*   We use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number.\n*   Inside the loop, we ask the user for their guess using `input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")`.\n*   We then check if the input is a valid integer using a `try-except` block. If the input is not a valid integer, we print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n*   Next, we check if the guess is within the correct range (between 1 and 10). If not, we print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n*   Finally, we compare the user's guess to the generated number and print 'Too low', 'Too high', or 'Congratulations!' accordingly. If the guess is correct, we break out of the loop, ending the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10. You can enter your guess, and it will respond with 'Too low', 'Too high', or 'Congratulations!' based on your guess. The program will continue to prompt you until you correctly guess the number.",
