  "prompt": "Write a function that filters out elements from a list that do not meet a specified condition based on their index.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that filters out elements from a list based on their index, helping you understand the implementation process and the code itself. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef filter_by_index(lst, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters out elements from a list that do not meet a specified condition based on their index.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an index and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the elements that meet the specified condition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered elements\n    filtered_list = []\n\n    # Iterate over the input list with both index and value\n    for i, val in enumerate(lst):\n        \n        # Check if the current index meets the specified condition\n        if condition(i):\n            \n            # If the condition is met, append the current element to the filtered list\n            filtered_list.append(val)\n\n    # Return the filtered list\n    return filtered_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a condition function that checks if an index is even\ndef is_even(index):\n    return index % 2 == 0\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(filter_by_index(numbers, is_even))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `filter_by_index` takes two parameters: `lst` (the input list) and `condition` (a function that determines whether an element should be included based on its index).\n*   Inside the function, an empty list `filtered_list` is initialized to store the elements that meet the specified condition.\n*   The function iterates over the input list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `val` of each element. For each element, it checks if the index meets the condition by calling the `condition` function with the index `i` as an argument. If the condition is met, the element is appended to `filtered_list`.\n*   Finally, the function returns `filtered_list`, which contains the filtered elements.",
