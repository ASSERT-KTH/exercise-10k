  "answer": "**Student Course Registration Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program registers a student for a course using if/else statements. It checks if the student is eligible to register for the course based on their age and course prerequisites.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, courses_taken):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.courses_taken = courses_taken\n\nclass Course:\n    def __init__(self, name, prerequisites):\n        self.name = name\n        self.prerequisites = prerequisites\n\ndef register_student(student, course):\n    # Check if student is eligible to register for the course\n    if student.age >= 18:\n        # Check if student has taken all prerequisites\n        if all(prerequisite in student.courses_taken for prerequisite in course.prerequisites):\n            print(f\"{student.name} has been successfully registered for {course.name}.\")\n            return True\n        else:\n            print(f\"{student.name} has not taken all prerequisites for {course.name}.\")\n            return False\n    else:\n        print(f\"{student.name} is not eligible to register for {course.name} due to age restrictions.\")\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\nstudent1 = Student(\"John Doe\", 20, [\"Math 101\", \"Science 102\"])\ncourse1 = Course(\"Computer Science 103\", [\"Math 101\", \"Science 102\"])\n\nstudent2 = Student(\"Jane Doe\", 17, [\"Math 101\"])\ncourse2 = Course(\"Computer Science 103\", [\"Math 101\", \"Science 102\"])\n\nregister_student(student1, course1)\nregister_student(student2, course2)\n```\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. The program defines two classes: `Student` and `Course`.\n2. The `Student` class has attributes for the student's name, age, and courses taken.\n3. The `Course` class has attributes for the course name and prerequisites.\n4. The `register_student` function takes a `Student` object and a `Course` object as input.\n5. It checks if the student is eligible to register for the course based on their age and course prerequisites using if/else statements.\n6. If the student is eligible, it prints a success message and returns `True`.\n7. If the student is not eligible, it prints an error message and returns `False`.\n\n**Example output**\n\n```\nJohn Doe has been successfully registered for Computer Science 103.\nJane Doe is not eligible to register for Computer Science 103 due to age restrictions.\nJane Doe has not taken all prerequisites for Computer Science 103.\n```",
