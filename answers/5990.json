  "answer": "### Function to Find Index of Value in List\n\nHere's a Python function that takes a list and a value as input, and returns the index of the value in the list if it exists. If the value is not found, it returns -1.\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a value in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        value: The value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the value if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(value)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(numbers, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(numbers, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution Using List Comprehension\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result. However, this approach is less efficient than the previous one, especially for large lists, because it creates a new list.\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a value in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        value: The value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the value if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x == value]\n    return indices[0] if indices else -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(numbers, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(numbers, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Solution Using Enumerate\n\nAnother way to solve this problem is by using the `enumerate` function in a for loop. This approach is more efficient than the list comprehension solution because it doesn't create a new list.\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a value in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        value: The value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the value if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n        if x == value:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(numbers, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(numbers, 6))  # Output: -1\n```",
