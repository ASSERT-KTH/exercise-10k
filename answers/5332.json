  "prompt": "Declare two integer variables with the values 10 and 20. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations and print the results.",
  "answer": "### Performing Arithmetic Operations\n#### Description\nThis code snippet will declare two integer variables, `num1` and `num2`, with the values 10 and 20, respectively. It will then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these variables and print the results.\n\n#### Code\n```python\n# Declare two integer variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 20\n\n# Perform addition\naddition_result = num1 + num2\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n# Perform subtraction\nsubtraction_result = num1 - num2\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n# Perform multiplication\nmultiplication_result = num1 * num2\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n# Perform division\nif num2 != 0:\n    division_result = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n```\n\n#### Example Output\n```\nAddition: 10 + 20 = 30\nSubtraction: 10 - 20 = -10\nMultiplication: 10 * 20 = 200\nDivision: 10 / 20 = 0.5\n```\n\n#### Note\nThis code checks for division by zero to prevent a runtime error. If the divisor is zero, it prints an error message instead of performing the division.",
