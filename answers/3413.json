  "answer": "**Merging Dictionaries**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that merges two dictionaries into one.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two dictionaries into one.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The merged dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the built-in dictionary update method to merge the dictionaries\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()  # Create a copy of the first dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)  # Update the copy with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary\n\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    dict2 = {\"c\": 3, \"d\": 4}\n\n    print(\"Dictionary 1:\", dict1)\n    print(\"Dictionary 2:\", dict2)\n\n    merged_dict = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2)\n    print(\"Merged Dictionary:\", merged_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `merge_dictionaries` function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that contains all the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n*   We create a copy of the first dictionary using the `copy` method to avoid modifying the original dictionary.\n*   We then use the `update` method to add the key-value pairs from the second dictionary to the copy of the first dictionary.\n*   If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override the values from the first dictionary in the merged dictionary.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nDictionary 1: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nDictionary 2: {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\nMerged Dictionary: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n```\n\n### Alternative Method\n\nYou can also use the `{**dict1, **dict2}` syntax to merge dictionaries in Python 3.5 and later:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n```\n\nThis method is more concise and efficient than the previous example, but it may not be as readable for those unfamiliar with the syntax.",
