  "answer": "**Memory Leak Demonstration**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that demonstrates the concept of memory leaks. This program creates a list and continuously appends new objects to it, simulating a memory leak.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport psutil\nimport time\n\n# Function to get the current memory usage\ndef get_memory_usage():\n    process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n    return process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)  # in MB\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Initialize an empty list\n    leaky_list = []\n\n    print(\"Initial memory usage: {:.2f} MB\".format(get_memory_usage()))\n\n    # Continuously append new objects to the list\n    for i in range(1000000):\n        leaky_list.append(bytearray(1024))  # Append a 1KB bytearray\n        if i % 10000 == 0:\n            print(\"Memory usage after {} iterations: {:.2f} MB\".format(i, get_memory_usage()))\n\n    # Keep the program running to observe the memory usage\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `get_memory_usage` function retrieves the current memory usage of the process.\n2. The `main` function initializes an empty list `leaky_list` and prints the initial memory usage.\n3. It then enters a loop where it continuously appends new `bytearray` objects (each 1KB in size) to the `leaky_list`.\n4. Every 10,000 iterations, it prints the current memory usage to demonstrate the increasing memory consumption.\n5. The program then enters an infinite loop to keep it running and allow observation of the memory usage.\n\n**Running the Program**\n----------------------\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `memory_leak.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python memory_leak.py`). Observe the memory usage of the process using your system's task manager or monitoring tools.\n\n**Note**: This program is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be run in a production environment, as it can cause significant memory consumption and potentially lead to system instability.",
