  "answer": "Here's an example implementation in Python using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the number of connected components in a graph:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, num_vertices):\n        self.num_vertices = num_vertices\n        self.adj_list = defaultdict(list)\n\n    def add_edge(self, u, v):\n        self.adj_list[u].append(v)\n        self.adj_list[v].append(u)\n\n    def dfs(self, vertex, visited):\n        visited[vertex] = True\n        for neighbor in self.adj_list[vertex]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                self.dfs(neighbor, visited)\n\n    def count_connected_components(self):\n        visited = [False] * self.num_vertices\n        count = 0\n        for vertex in range(self.num_vertices):\n            if not visited[vertex]:\n                self.dfs(vertex, visited)\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num_vertices = 6\n    edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4)]\n\n    graph = Graph(num_vertices)\n    for u, v in edges:\n        graph.add_edge(u, v)\n\n    print(\"Number of connected components:\", graph.count_connected_components())\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  We create a `Graph` class to represent the graph, which uses an adjacency list to store the graph's edges.\n2.  The `add_edge` method adds an edge between two vertices.\n3.  The `dfs` method performs a depth-first search from a given vertex, marking all reachable vertices as visited.\n4.  The `count_connected_components` method iterates over all vertices, and for each unvisited vertex, it performs a DFS and increments the count of connected components.\n5.  Finally, we create a sample graph with 6 vertices and 3 edges, and we print the number of connected components using the `count_connected_components` method.\n\n**Time complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, since we visit each vertex and edge once.\n\n**Space complexity:** O(V), since we use a visited array to keep track of visited vertices.",
