  "answer": "**Levenshtein Distance**\n=======================\n\nThe Levenshtein distance is a measure of the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef levenshtein_distance(s1, s2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform s1 into s2.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The source string.\n        s2 (str): The target string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of operations needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Initialize the base cases\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n\n    # Fill in the rest of the table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            cost = 0 if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1] else 1\n            dp[i][j] = min(\n                dp[i - 1][j] + 1,      # Deletion\n                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,      # Insertion\n                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost  # Substitution or no operation\n            )\n\n    return dp[m][n]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n```python\nprint(levenshtein_distance(\"kitten\", \"sitting\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(levenshtein_distance(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # Output: 4\nprint(levenshtein_distance(\"\", \"abc\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(levenshtein_distance(\"abc\", \"\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(levenshtein_distance(\"\", \"\"))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe function uses dynamic programming to build a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to transform the first `i` characters of `s1` into the first `j` characters of `s2`.\n\nThe base cases are when one of the strings is empty, in which case the minimum number of operations is equal to the length of the non-empty string.\n\nThe rest of the table is filled in by considering three operations:\n\n* Deletion: `dp[i - 1][j] + 1`\n* Insertion: `dp[i][j - 1] + 1`\n* Substitution or no operation: `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost`, where `cost` is 0 if the current characters match and 1 otherwise.\n\nThe minimum number of operations is the minimum of these three options. The final result is stored in `dp[m][n]`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.",
