  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n======================================\n\nHere is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python where the user can play against the computer.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**How to Run the Game**\n------------------------\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the game by typing `python rock_paper_scissors.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n**Game Rules**\n--------------\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n* If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nYou win!\n\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \n```",
