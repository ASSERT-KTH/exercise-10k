  "prompt": "Create a program that prints a square pattern of asterisks (*) using loops. The size of the square should be determined by the user's input. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program should print a 5x5 square of asterisks.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int n;\n  cout << \"Enter a number: \";\n  cin >> n;\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n      cout << \"* \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header file, uses the `std` namespace, and defines the `main` function. It prompts the user to enter a number, reads the input, and uses two nested loops to print the square pattern of asterisks. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and the inner loop also iterates `n` times, printing an asterisk followed by a space on each iteration. After the inner loop completes, the outer loop prints a newline character using `endl`. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
