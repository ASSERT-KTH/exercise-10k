  "answer": "**Removing the First Occurrence of an Element from an Array of Strings**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven an array of strings and a target string, write a function to remove the first occurrence of the target string from the array.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_first_occurrence(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n    array (list): The array of strings.\n    target (str): The target string to be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The array with the first occurrence of the target string removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Get the index of the first occurrence of the target string\n        index = array.index(target)\n        \n        # Remove the element at the index\n        array.pop(index)\n        \n        # Return the updated array\n        return array\n    \n    except ValueError:\n        # If the target string is not found in the array, return the original array\n        return array\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\ntarget = \"banana\"\nprint(remove_first_occurrence(array, target))  # Output: [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `remove_first_occurrence` takes two arguments: `array` and `target`.\n2. It uses the `index` method to find the index of the first occurrence of the `target` string in the `array`.\n3. If the `target` string is found, it uses the `pop` method to remove the element at the index.\n4. If the `target` string is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, and the function returns the original `array`.\n5. The function returns the updated `array` with the first occurrence of the `target` string removed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because the `index` method iterates through the array to find the target string. The `pop` method also has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, when the element to be removed is at the beginning of the array.",
