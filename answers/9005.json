  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number must be non-negative.\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Base Case**: The function checks if the input number `n` is 0 or 1. If so, it returns 1, as the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined to be 1.\n2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This process repeats until the base case is reached.\n3. **Error Handling**: The function raises a `ValueError` if the input number is negative, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial, which can be less efficient than an iterative approach for large inputs due to the overhead of function calls.\n* The function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you need to support non-integer inputs, consider using the `math.gamma` function or implementing a more advanced algorithm.",
