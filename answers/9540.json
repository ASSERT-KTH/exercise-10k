  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a user's input and determines the data type of the input. The program should check if the input is an integer, float, or string, and print out the corresponding data type.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications you provided:\n```\n# This program determines the data type of the user's input\n\n# Ask the user for input\nuser_input = input(\"Please enter a number or a word: \")\n\n# Check if the input is an integer\ntry:\n    int(user_input)\n    print(\"You've entered an integer.\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    # Check if the input is a float\n    try:\n        float(user_input)\n        print(\"You've entered a float.\")\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the input is neither an integer nor a float, it must be a string\n        print(\"You've entered a string.\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, using `try`-`except` blocks to attempt to convert the input to an integer and then a float, and printing the corresponding data type if the conversion is successful. If both conversions fail, it prints that the input is a string.",
