  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses a simple iterative approach to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): A positive integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input should be a positive integer\")\n\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(fibonacci(n))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n*   We handle edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2 separately to ensure the function behaves correctly for these inputs.\n*   For `n` greater than 2, we initialize a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and then use a while loop to generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers.\n*   In each iteration of the loop, we append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the list.\n*   Once the list contains `n` numbers, we return it as the result.\n*   Finally, we demonstrate the function's usage with an example where `n` is 10.",
