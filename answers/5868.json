  "answer": "Here is a Python solution to create a new list with only the elements that meet a certain condition:\n\n### Filtering a List\n\nYou can use a list comprehension to filter a list and create a new list with only the elements that meet a certain condition.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_list(original_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a new list with only the elements that meet a certain condition.\n\n    Args:\n        original_list (list): The original list to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes an element and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with only the elements that meet the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in original_list if condition(element)]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Define a condition function\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\n# Filter the list\neven_numbers = filter_list(numbers, is_even)\n\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n#### How it Works\n\n1. The `filter_list` function takes an `original_list` and a `condition` function as arguments.\n2. The list comprehension iterates over each `element` in the `original_list`.\n3. For each `element`, the `condition` function is called with the `element` as an argument.\n4. If the `condition` function returns `True`, the `element` is included in the new list.\n5. The new list is returned.\n\n#### Example Use Cases\n\n* Filter a list of numbers to get only the even numbers.\n* Filter a list of strings to get only the strings that start with a certain letter.\n* Filter a list of objects to get only the objects that meet a certain criteria.",
