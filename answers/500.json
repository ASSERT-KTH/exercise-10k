  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a binary operation as input, and returns the result of applying the binary operation to all elements in the list, accumulating the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n\n```python\ndef fold_left(op, l):\n    r = l[0]\n    for element in l[1:]:\n        r = op(r, element)\n    return r\n\ndef mul(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\nprint(fold_left(mul, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n```\n\nThis code defines a `fold_left` function that takes a binary operation `op` and a list `l` as input, and applies the operation to all elements in the list, accumulating the result. The `mul` function is a simple multiplication function that is used as an example of a binary operation. The `print` statement demonstrates the use of the `fold_left` function with the `mul` operation and the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The output of this code would be `120`, which is the result of multiplying all the elements in the list together.",
