  "answer": "**Division Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the quotient and remainder of two numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = calculate_quotient_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function takes two arguments: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if true.\n3. It calculates the quotient using integer division (`//`) and the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_quotient_and_remainder` function.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\n17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2\n```\n\n**Notes**\n---------\n\n* This program uses Python 3.x syntax and features.\n* The `//` operator performs integer division, which discards the fractional part of the result.\n* The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division operation.",
