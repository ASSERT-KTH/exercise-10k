  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): The coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (list): The coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    return math.sqrt(sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1_2d = [1, 2]\n    point2_2d = [4, 6]\n    point1_3d = [1, 2, 3]\n    point2_3d = [4, 5, 6]\n\n    print(f\"Distance between {point1_2d} and {point2_2d}: {calculate_distance(point1_2d, point2_2d)}\")\n    print(f\"Distance between {point1_3d} and {point2_3d}: {calculate_distance(point1_3d, point2_3d)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_distance` function takes two points as input, each represented as a list of coordinates.\n*   It checks if both points have the same number of dimensions and raises a `ValueError` if they don't.\n*   It calculates the Euclidean distance using the formula: \u221a(\u2211(a - b)^2), where `a` and `b` are the corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with example points in 2D and 3D spaces.\n\n### Usage\n\n1.  Save the code in a file named `distance_calculator.py`.\n2.  Run the program using Python: `python distance_calculator.py`.\n3.  The program will output the distances between the example points.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This program uses the Euclidean distance formula, which is suitable for most applications.\n*   For other distance metrics, such as Manhattan distance or Minkowski distance, you can modify the `calculate_distance` function accordingly.",
