  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a condition as input and returns the indices of the elements that satisfy the condition.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <functional>\n\ntemplate <typename T, typename Condition>\nstd::vector<int> get_indices(const std::vector<T>& vec, Condition condition) {\n    std::vector<int> indices;\n    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {\n        if (condition(vec[i])) {\n            indices.push_back(i);\n        }\n    }\n    return indices;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n    std::vector<int> indices1 = get_indices(vec, [](int x){ return x > 3; });\n    std::vector<int> indices2 = get_indices(vec, [](int x){ return x > 7; });\n\n    std::cout << \"Indices of elements greater than 3: \";\n    for (int i : indices1) {\n        std::cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    std::cout << \"Indices of elements greater than 7: \";\n    for (int i : indices2) {\n        std::cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code defines the `get_indices` function template, which takes a vector `vec` of type `T` and a condition `condition` of type `Condition` as input. The function iterates over the elements of the vector and checks if each element satisfies the condition. If an element satisfies the condition, its index is added to the `indices` vector. The function returns the `indices` vector.\n\nIn the `main` function, we create a vector `vec` containing integers from 1 to 10. We then define two lambda functions: `[](int x){ return x > 3; }` and `[](int x){ return x > 7; }`. These lambda functions represent the conditions that we want to apply to the elements of the vector.\n\nWe call the `get_indices` function twice, once with each lambda function, and store the results in `indices1` and `indices2`, respectively. We then print the indices of the elements that satisfy each condition.\n\nNote that I used the `std::vector` class to represent the array of indices, as it is a more modern and efficient way to represent dynamic arrays in C++. I also used the `std::cout` statement to print the results, as it is a more convenient and flexible way to print output in C++.",
