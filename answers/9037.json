  "answer": "**Power Function**\n====================\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the result of raising a base number to the power of an exponent.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.\n\n    Args:\n    base (float): The base number.\n    exponent (float): The exponent.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    base = 2\n    exponent = 3\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `power` takes two arguments, `base` and `exponent`, both of which are expected to be numbers.\n*   It uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the result of raising the `base` to the power of the `exponent`.\n*   The result is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we call the `power` function with a base of 2 and an exponent of 3, and print the result.",
