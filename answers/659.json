  "answer": "**Password Generator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random password for the user based on a set of criteria, including password length, character types, and special characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport string\nimport secrets\n\ndef generate_password(length: int, use_uppercase: bool, use_numbers: bool, use_special_chars: bool) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a random password based on the given criteria.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password.\n        use_uppercase (bool): Whether to include uppercase letters.\n        use_numbers (bool): Whether to include numbers.\n        use_special_chars (bool): Whether to include special characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the character sets to use\n    chars = string.ascii_lowercase\n    if use_uppercase:\n        chars += string.ascii_uppercase\n    if use_numbers:\n        chars += string.digits\n    if use_special_chars:\n        chars += string.punctuation\n\n    # Generate the password\n    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))\n\n    return password\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    length = int(input(\"Enter the password length: \"))\n    use_uppercase = input(\"Include uppercase letters? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n    use_numbers = input(\"Include numbers? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n    use_special_chars = input(\"Include special characters? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n\n    # Generate the password\n    password = generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars)\n\n    # Print the password\n    print(\"Generated Password : \", password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_password` function takes four parameters: `length`, `use_uppercase`, `use_numbers`, and `use_special_chars`.\n2. It defines the character sets to use based on the input parameters.\n3. It generates a random password of the specified length using the `secrets.choice` function.\n4. The `main` function gets user input for the password length and character types.\n5. It calls the `generate_password` function with the user input and prints the generated password.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the password length when prompted.\n2. Choose whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n3. The program will generate and print a random password based on your input.\n\nNote: This program uses the `secrets` module, which is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.",
