  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, iterates over each number, and calculates the sum. The average is then calculated by dividing the sum by the total count of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    return average\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of the list {numbers} is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of the numbers.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list, adding it to the `total`.\n4. Calculate the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the list.\n5. Return the average.\n6. In the `main` function, provide an example usage of the `calculate_average` function.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe average of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is: 3.0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur when calculating the average. To handle this case, you can add a simple check before calculating the average:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return None  # or any other default value\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    return average\n```",
