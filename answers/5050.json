  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers using the following formula:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a[(\u03a3(xi - \u03bc)\u00b2) / (n - 1)]\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation\n- xi is each value in the list\n- \u03bc is the mean of the list\n- n is the number of values in the list\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n    \n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count.\n2. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers by:\n   - Calculating the mean of the list\n   - Calculating the variance by summing the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the total count minus one (Bessel's correction)\n   - Taking the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_mean` and `calculate_standard_deviation` functions with a sample list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n----------------------\n\n* Calculating the standard deviation of a list of exam scores to understand the spread of scores\n* Analyzing the standard deviation of a set of measurements to determine the variability of the data\n* Using the standard deviation to create a confidence interval for a statistical estimate",
