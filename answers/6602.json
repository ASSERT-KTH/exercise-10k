  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and then prints out a greeting message with the name.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for their name\n    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\n    # Print out a greeting message with the name\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `main` function is defined to contain the program's logic.\n* The `input` function is used to get the user's name. The string passed to `input` is the prompt that will be displayed to the user.\n* The `print` function is used to display the greeting message. The `f-string` syntax (the `f` before the string) allows us to insert the `name` variable into the string.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print \"What is your name? \" and wait for the user to type their name. After the user presses enter, it will print out a greeting message with the name, such as \"Hello, John!\".",
