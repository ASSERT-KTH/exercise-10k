Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively. The extra row and column are for handling edge cases.\n2.  Fill the `dp` array using dynamic programming. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, if the characters at positions `i - 1` and `j - 1` in `str1` and `str2` match, set `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, set `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.\n3.  Reconstruct the LCS by tracing back the `dp` array from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner. If the characters at the current positions match, add the character to the LCS and move diagonally up-left. Otherwise, move up or left depending on which cell has a higher value.\n4.  Return the LCS in the correct order by reversing the reconstructed string.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n*   The reconstruction of the LCS has a time complexity of O(m + n) in the worst case, but it's typically much faster in practice.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The `dp` array requires O(m \\* n) space to store the dynamic programming table.\n*   The reconstructed LCS requires O(min(m, n)) space in the worst case, but it's typically much smaller in practice.",
