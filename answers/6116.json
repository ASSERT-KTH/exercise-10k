  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the list and the values are lists of indices at which each integer appears in the original list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef list_to_dict(lst):\n    dict_indices = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        if num not in dict_indices:\n            dict_indices[num] = [i]\n        else:\n            dict_indices[num].append(i)\n    return dict_indices\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(list_to_dict(lst))\n```\nThis code defines the `list_to_dict` function, which takes a list `lst` as input and returns a dictionary `dict_indices`. The function iterates over the list using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `num` of each element.\n\nFor each element, it checks if the value `num` is already a key in the `dict_indices` dictionary. If it's not, it creates a new key-value pair with the value `num` as the key and a list containing the current index `i` as the value. If the key already exists, it appends the current index `i` to the list of indices associated with that key.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `dict_indices` dictionary.\n\nThe example usage shows how to call the `list_to_dict` function with a sample list `lst` and print the resulting dictionary. The expected output is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list, and the value is a list of indices at which that integer appears in the original list.",
