  "answer": "**Function to Find Exclusive Characters**\n======================================\n\nHere is a Python function that finds the characters that are in either the first string or the second string, but not in both:\n\n```python\ndef exclusive_characters(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the characters that are in either the first string or the second string, but not in both.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of characters that are in either str1 or str2, but not in both.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the strings to sets of characters\n    set1 = set(str1)\n    set2 = set(str2)\n\n    # Use the symmetric difference operation to find the exclusive characters\n    exclusive = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n\n    return exclusive\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"abc\"\nstr2 = \"bcd\"\nprint(exclusive_characters(str1, str2))  # Output: {'a', 'd'}\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The function takes two strings as input and converts them to sets of characters using the `set()` function.\n2. It then uses the `symmetric_difference()` method to find the characters that are in either set, but not in both. This method returns a new set containing all elements that are in exactly one of the sets.\n3. The resulting set of exclusive characters is returned by the function.\n\n**Alternative Implementation**\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can also use the `^` operator to find the symmetric difference between two sets:\n\n```python\ndef exclusive_characters(str1, str2):\n    return set(str1) ^ set(str2)\n```\n\nThis implementation is more concise and produces the same result as the previous example.",
