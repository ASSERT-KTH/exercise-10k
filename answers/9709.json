  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop or a while loop, where n is the input to the program.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n  int n;\n  int sum = 0;\n\n  std::cout << \"Enter a number: \";\n  std::cin >> n;\n\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    sum += i * i;\n  }\n\n  std::cout << \"The sum of squares of numbers from 1 to \" << n << \" is \" << sum << std::endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It includes the `iostream` header file to enable input/output operations.\n2. It defines the `main()` function as the entry point of the program.\n3. It declares two integer variables: `n` to store the input number and `sum` to store the sum of squares, initialized to 0.\n4. It prompts the user to enter a number and reads the input using `std::cin`.\n5. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive), calculating the sum of squares by adding the square of each number to the `sum` variable.\n6. It prints the result to the console using `std::cout`, including the input number `n` and the calculated sum of squares.\n\nNote that I used a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop, as it is more concise and easier to read for this specific problem. However, the code can be easily modified to use a `while` loop if desired.",
