  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pyramid pattern of asterisks (*) based on the input number of rows. The pattern should be centered and symmetrical. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be a pyramid with 5 rows.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Python:\n```python\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    print(\" \" * (n - i - 1) + \"*\" * (2 * i + 1))\n```\nThis code will print a pyramid pattern with the specified number of rows. For example, if the input is 5, the output will be:\n```\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n```\nThis code meets the requirements specified in the overview, including getting user input, using a loop to print the pyramid, and using asterisks to form the pattern.",
