  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their interests and then recommends a list of products based on their interests.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary of products with their corresponding interests\nproducts = {\n    \"books\": [\"Harry Potter\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"Pride and Prejudice\"],\n    \"music\": [\"Guitar\", \"Piano\", \"Vinyl Records\"],\n    \"sports\": [\"Basketball\", \"Football\", \"Tennis Racket\"],\n    \"art\": [\"Paints\", \"Canvas\", \"Sketchbook\"],\n    \"travel\": [\"Backpack\", \"Suitcase\", \"Travel Guide\"]\n}\n\ndef get_interests():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their interests and returns a list of interests\"\"\"\n    print(\"What are your interests? (separate with comma)\")\n    print(\"Available interests: books, music, sports, art, travel\")\n    interests = input().lower().split(\",\")\n    interests = [interest.strip() for interest in interests]\n    return interests\n\ndef recommend_products(interests):\n    \"\"\"Recommends products based on the user's interests\"\"\"\n    recommended_products = []\n    for interest in interests:\n        if interest in products:\n            recommended_products.extend(products[interest])\n    return recommended_products\n\ndef main():\n    interests = get_interests()\n    recommended_products = recommend_products(interests)\n    if recommended_products:\n        print(\"Based on your interests, we recommend the following products:\")\n        for product in recommended_products:\n            print(product)\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, we couldn't find any products that match your interests.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `products` where the keys are interests and the values are lists of products related to those interests.\n2. The `get_interests()` function asks the user for their interests and returns a list of interests.\n3. The `recommend_products()` function takes the list of interests and returns a list of recommended products based on those interests.\n4. The `main()` function calls `get_interests()` and `recommend_products()` and prints the recommended products to the user.\n\nYou can run this program and test it out by entering your interests when prompted. For example, if you enter \"books, music\", the program will recommend products like \"Harry Potter\", \"Guitar\", etc.",
