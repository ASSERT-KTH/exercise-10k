  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num (int): The number for which the multiplication table is to be printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Multiplication table for {num}:\")\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{num} x {i} = {num * i}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint_multiplication_table(num)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `print_multiplication_table` function takes an integer `num` as input.\n2. It prints a header message indicating the multiplication table for the given number.\n3. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication of the input number `num` with the current iteration number `i`, along with the result.\n5. In the example usage, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `print_multiplication_table` function to print the multiplication table.\n\n### Example output:\n\nIf the user enters `5`, the program will output:\n```\nMultiplication table for 5:\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```",
