Create a counter for the characters in the string `t` to keep track of the required characters.\n2.  Initialize the minimum window substring and its length.\n3.  Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.\n4.  Iterate over the string `s` using the `right` pointer.\n5.  For each character, add it to the window counts and update the formed character count if necessary.\n6.  When the window contains all characters of `t`, try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n7.  Update the minimum window substring if the current window is smaller.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over the string `s` once.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string `t`. This is because we create a counter for the characters in `t` and a counter for the characters in the current window.",
