  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program to plan a trip:\n\n```python\nclass TripPlanner:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.trips = {}\n\n    def plan_trip(self):\n        \"\"\"Plan a trip by inputting destination, departure date, and return date.\"\"\"\n        destination = input(\"Enter your destination: \")\n        departure_date = input(\"Enter your departure date (YYYY-MM-DD): \")\n        return_date = input(\"Enter your return date (YYYY-MM-DD): \")\n\n        trip_details = {\n            \"Destination\": destination,\n            \"Departure Date\": departure_date,\n            \"Return Date\": return_date\n        }\n\n        self.trips[len(self.trips) + 1] = trip_details\n\n        print(\"\\nTrip Details:\")\n        for key, value in trip_details.items():\n            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n    def view_trips(self):\n        \"\"\"View all planned trips.\"\"\"\n        if not self.trips:\n            print(\"No trips planned.\")\n        else:\n            for trip_id, trip_details in self.trips.items():\n                print(f\"\\nTrip {trip_id} Details:\")\n                for key, value in trip_details.items():\n                    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    trip_planner = TripPlanner()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nTrip Planner Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Plan a trip\")\n        print(\"2. View all trips\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            trip_planner.plan_trip()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            trip_planner.view_trips()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1.  The program defines a `TripPlanner` class to manage trip planning.\n2.  The `plan_trip` method prompts the user to input their destination, departure date, and return date. It then stores these details in a dictionary and adds it to the `trips` dictionary.\n3.  The `view_trips` method displays all planned trips by iterating through the `trips` dictionary.\n4.  In the `main` function, a `TripPlanner` object is created, and a menu-driven interface is implemented using a while loop. The user can choose to plan a trip, view all trips, or exit the program.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nWhen you run the program, you'll see a menu with options to plan a trip, view all trips, or exit. Choose option 1 to plan a trip, and enter your destination, departure date, and return date when prompted. The program will display your trip details. You can then choose option 2 to view all your planned trips.",
