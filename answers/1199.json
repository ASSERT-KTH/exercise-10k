  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the exam grade based on the number of correct answers and the total number of questions.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the exam grade based on the number of correct answers and the total number of questions:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(correct_answers, total_questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the exam grade based on the number of correct answers and the total number of questions.\n\n    Args:\n        correct_answers (int): The number of correct answers.\n        total_questions (int): The total number of questions.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The exam grade as a percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    if total_questions == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Total number of questions cannot be zero\")\n\n    grade = (correct_answers / total_questions) * 100\n    return grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of correct answers and total questions from the user\n    correct_answers = int(input(\"Enter the number of correct answers: \"))\n    total_questions = int(input(\"Enter the total number of questions: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the exam grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(correct_answers, total_questions)\n\n    # Print the exam grade\n    print(f\"Your exam grade is: {grade:.2f}%\")\n\n    # Determine the letter grade based on the percentage\n    if grade >= 90:\n        print(\"Your letter grade is: A\")\n    elif grade >= 80:\n        print(\"Your letter grade is: B\")\n    elif grade >= 70:\n        print(\"Your letter grade is: C\")\n    elif grade >= 60:\n        print(\"Your letter grade is: D\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Your letter grade is: F\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes the number of correct answers and total questions as input and returns the exam grade as a percentage.\n2. The `main` function gets the number of correct answers and total questions from the user and calculates the exam grade using the `calculate_grade` function.\n3. The exam grade is then printed to the console, along with the corresponding letter grade based on the percentage.\n\n### Example usage\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of correct answers and total questions. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the number of correct answers: 8\nEnter the total number of questions: 10\nYour exam grade is: 80.00%\nYour letter grade is: B\n```\n\nNote: This program uses a simple grading scale where A = 90-100%, B = 80-89%, C = 70-79%, D = 60-69%, and F = below 60%. You can modify the grading scale as needed.",
