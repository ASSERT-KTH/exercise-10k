  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year or not using an if/else statement.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"Check if a year is a leap year\"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year.\n2. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year and checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function.\n4. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a year: 2020\n Output: 2020 is a leap year.\n* Enter a year: 2021\n Output: 2021 is not a leap year.\n* Enter a year: 1900\n Output: 1900 is not a leap year.\n* Enter a year: 2000\n Output: 2000 is a leap year.",
