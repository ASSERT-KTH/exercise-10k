  "answer": "**Random Password Generator Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a for loop to generate a random password of length 10. The password will consist of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a random password of the given length.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the characters that can be used in the password\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n    \n    # Initialize an empty password\n    password = \"\"\n    \n    # Use a for loop to generate the password\n    for _ in range(length):\n        # Randomly select a character from the possible characters\n        password += random.choice(characters)\n    \n    return password\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the length of the password\n    password_length = 10\n    \n    # Generate and print the password\n    password = generate_password(password_length)\n    print(f\"Generated Password: {password}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the above program, it will generate and print a random password of length 10. The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nGenerated Password: G4j#8dLpM2\n```\n\nNote that the actual password generated will be different each time you run the program due to the random nature of the password generation process.\n\n**Security Note:**\n\nWhile this program generates a random password, it is not suitable for generating passwords for sensitive applications. For such applications, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator and following best practices for password generation.",
