  "answer": "**Number of Factors Program**\n================================\n\nThis program takes an integer as input and returns the number of factors it has.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef count_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of factors of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to find factors for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If i is a factor, n//i is also a factor\n            if i * i == n:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    factors = count_factors(num)\n    print(f\"The number {num} has {factors} factors.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `count_factors` function iterates from 1 to the square root of the input number.\n2. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is a factor of the input number `n` by using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).\n3. If `i` is a factor, `n//i` is also a factor. If `i` is equal to `n//i` (i.e., `i` is the square root of `n`), it only counts as one factor. Otherwise, it counts as two factors.\n4. The `main` function takes user input, calls `count_factors`, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: 12, Output: 6 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)\n* Input: 25, Output: 3 (factors: 1, 5, 25)\n* Input: 36, Output: 9 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36)\n\nRun this program, enter a number when prompted, and it will display the number of factors for that number.",
