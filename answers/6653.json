  "answer": "**Division Program**\n======================\n### Description\nThis program takes two integers as input, divides the first number by the second, and prints the quotient and remainder.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers and print the quotient and remainder.\n    \n    Args:\n    dividend (int): The number being divided.\n    divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return\n    \n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    print(f\"Quotient: {quotient}\")\n    print(f\"Remainder: {remainder}\")\n\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    \n    divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `divide_numbers` function takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, as input.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero to prevent division by zero errors.\n3. It calculates the quotient using integer division (`//`) and the remainder using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4. It prints the quotient and remainder.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates example usage by taking user input for the dividend and divisor and calling the `divide_numbers` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Divide 17 by 5:\n\t+ Quotient: 3\n\t+ Remainder: 2\n* Divide 10 by 2:\n\t+ Quotient: 5\n\t+ Remainder: 0",
