  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in Python:\n\n### Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n```python\n# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the game board\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the game board\"\"\"\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef check_win():\n    \"\"\"Check if there's a winner\"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if ' ' not in board:\n        return 'Tie'\n    return False\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"Main game loop\"\"\"\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_win()\n        if result:\n            print_board()\n            if result == 'Tie':\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Player {} wins!\".format(result))\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    game()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Game\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the game by typing `python tic_tac_toe.py`.\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.\n* Two players, X and O, take turns marking a square.\n* The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.\n* If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.",
