  "answer": "**Reversing a List of Integers**\n================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a list of integers, write a program to reverse the order of its elements.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a simple Python program that uses slicing to reverse the list:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the order of elements in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be reversed.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The reversed list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return input_list[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Reversed list:\", reverse_list(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `reverse_list` function takes a list as input and returns the reversed list.\n*   The `[::-1]` slicing syntax tells Python to start at the end of the list and move backwards to the beginning, stepping backwards by 1 element each time.\n*   This approach is concise and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nAlternatively, you can use the built-in `reversed` function in combination with the `list` function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_list(input_list):\n    return list(reversed(input_list))\n```\n\nThis approach also has a time complexity of O(n) and is a good option if you prefer a more explicit and readable solution.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the example usage, you should see the following output:\n\n```\nOriginal list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nReversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```",
