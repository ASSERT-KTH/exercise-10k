  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two input functions. This will help you understand how to implement function composition in Python. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function \n    that is the composition of the two input functions.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function to be composed.\n        func2 (function): The second function to be composed.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We want to return a new function, so we define it inside our compose_functions function\n    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # First, we call func2 with the provided arguments and keyword arguments\n        # The result of this function call will be used as the input for func1\n        result_from_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Then, we call func1 with the result from func2 as its input\n        # This is the actual composition of the two functions\n        result_from_func1 = func1(result_from_func2)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the result from func1\n        return result_from_func1\n    \n    # We return the composed function\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef multiply_by_two(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ncomposed = compose_functions(multiply_by_two, add_one)\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions `func1` and `func2` as arguments and returns a new function `composed_function`. This new function is defined inside `compose_functions`.\n* Inside `composed_function`, we first call `func2` with the provided arguments and keyword arguments, and store the result in `result_from_func2`. This result is then used as the input for `func1`.\n* We then call `func1` with `result_from_func2` as its input, and store the result in `result_from_func1`. This is the actual composition of the two functions.\n* Finally, we return `result_from_func1` from the `composed_function`, which represents the composition of `func1` and `func2`.",
