  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that calculates permutations and combinations.\n\n### Permutation and Combination Calculator\n#### Description\nThis program takes two numbers as input and calculates their permutation and combination.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_permutation(n, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the permutation of n items taken r at a time.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The total number of items.\n        r (int): The number of items to choose.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The permutation of n items taken r at a time.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.factorial(n) // math.factorial(n - r)\n\ndef calculate_combination(n, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the combination of n items taken r at a time.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The total number of items.\n        r (int): The number of items to choose.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The combination of n items taken r at a time.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.comb(n, r)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the total number of items (n): \"))\n    r = int(input(\"Enter the number of items to choose (r): \"))\n\n    permutation = calculate_permutation(n, r)\n    combination = calculate_combination(n, r)\n\n    print(f\"The permutation of {n} items taken {r} at a time is: {permutation}\")\n    print(f\"The combination of {n} items taken {r} at a time is: {combination}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The program first imports the `math` module to use the `factorial` and `comb` functions.\n2. It then defines two functions: `calculate_permutation` and `calculate_combination`.\n   * The `calculate_permutation` function calculates the permutation of `n` items taken `r` at a time using the formula `n! / (n - r)!`.\n   * The `calculate_combination` function calculates the combination of `n` items taken `r` at a time using the `math.comb` function.\n3. In the `main` function, it asks the user to input the total number of items (`n`) and the number of items to choose (`r`).\n4. It then calls the `calculate_permutation` and `calculate_combination` functions with the user's input and prints the results.\n\n#### Example Use Case\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter the total number of items (`n`) and the number of items to choose (`r`). For example:\n```\nEnter the total number of items (n): 5\nEnter the number of items to choose (r): 3\n```\nThe program will then output:\n```\nThe permutation of 5 items taken 3 at a time is: 60\nThe combination of 5 items taken 3 at a time is: 10\n```",
