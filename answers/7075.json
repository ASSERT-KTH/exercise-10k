  "answer": "**Reading a Floating-Point Number and Printing its Cube**\n==========================================================\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that reads a floating-point number from the user and prints its cube.\n\n```python\ndef read_and_cube_float():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a floating-point number from the user and prints its cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read a floating-point number from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num = float(input(\"Enter a floating-point number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid floating-point number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the cube of the number\n    cube = num ** 3\n    print(f\"The cube of {num} is: {cube}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    read_and_cube_float()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1.  The code defines a function `read_and_cube_float()` that encapsulates the entire process.\n2.  Inside the function, a `while` loop is used to continuously prompt the user for input until a valid floating-point number is entered.\n3.  The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input to a `float`. If successful, the loop breaks.\n4.  If the input cannot be converted to a `float` (i.e., a `ValueError` occurs), an error message is printed, and the loop continues.\n5.  Once a valid floating-point number is read, its cube is calculated using the exponentiation operator (`** 3`).\n6.  Finally, the cube of the number is printed to the console.\n7.  The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `read_and_cube_float()` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run this code, it will prompt you to enter a floating-point number. After entering a valid number, it will print the cube of that number. For example:\n\n```\nEnter a floating-point number: 2.5\nThe cube of 2.5 is: 15.625\n```",
