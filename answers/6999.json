  "answer": "**Cylinder Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nWhere:\n- V is the volume of the cylinder\n- \u03c0 is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- r is the radius of the cylinder\n- h is the height of the cylinder\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cylinder: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cylinder: \"))\n\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cylinder is: {volume:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius and height of the cylinder when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the volume of the cylinder.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` module for the value of \u03c0 and raises a `ValueError` if the input radius or height is negative.",
