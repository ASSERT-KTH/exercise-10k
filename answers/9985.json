  "answer": "**Calculating BMI using Floating Point Variables**\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that calculates the BMI of a person given their height and weight.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(height, weight):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the BMI of a person given their height and weight.\n\n    Args:\n        height (float): The height of the person in meters.\n        weight (float): The weight of the person in kilograms.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated BMI.\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef classify_bmi(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify the BMI into different categories.\n\n    Args:\n        bmi (float): The calculated BMI.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding BMI category.\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal\"\n    elif bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Input height and weight\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kilograms: \"))\n\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(height, weight)\n\n    # Classify BMI\n    classification = classify_bmi(bmi)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your BMI classification is: {classification}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define two functions: `calculate_bmi` to calculate the BMI and `classify_bmi` to classify the BMI into different categories.\n*   In the `main` function, we take the height and weight as input from the user, calculate the BMI, classify it, and print the results.\n*   The BMI is calculated using the formula `BMI = weight / height^2`, where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.\n*   The BMI classification is based on the following categories:\n    *   Underweight: BMI < 18.5\n    *   Normal: 18.5 <= BMI < 25\n    *   Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30\n    *   Obese: BMI >= 30\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the code, it will prompt you to enter your height and weight. After entering the values, it will calculate and display your BMI along with its classification.\n\n```\nEnter your height in meters: 1.75\nEnter your weight in kilograms: 70\nYour BMI is: 22.86\nYour BMI classification is: Normal\n```",
