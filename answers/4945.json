  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple implementation of a rock, paper, scissors game in Python:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of rock, paper, scissors\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\")\n\n    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Get Computer's Choice**: The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n2. **Determine Winner**: The `determine_winner` function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input and returns the result of the game based on the following rules:\n   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.\n   - If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the user wins.\n   - Otherwise, the computer wins.\n3. **Main Function**: The `main` function plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. It asks the user for their choice, gets the computer's choice, determines the winner, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Run the program and enter `rock` when prompted. The computer will randomly choose one of `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`, and the program will determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n- Run the program and enter an invalid input, such as `abc`. The program will ask for input again until a valid choice is entered.",
