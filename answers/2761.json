  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef greet_user():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for their name\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n    # Print out a greeting message\n    print(f\"Hello, {user_name}! It's nice to meet you.\")\n\n# Call the function to start the program\ngreet_user()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function called `greet_user` that encapsulates the program's functionality.\n2. **Get user input**: Inside the function, we use the built-in `input` function to ask the user for their name and store it in the `user_name` variable.\n3. **Print a greeting message**: We use an f-string to create a greeting message that includes the user's name and print it to the console.\n4. **Call the function**: Finally, we call the `greet_user` function to start the program.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John! It's nice to meet you.\n```",
