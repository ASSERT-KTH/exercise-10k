  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value. The program should iterate over the list to find the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_max(numbers):\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = find_max(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code defines a function `find_max` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The function iterates over the list using a `for` loop and keeps track of the maximum value found so far. The code then creates a list of numbers, calls the `find_max` function with this list, and prints the result.",
