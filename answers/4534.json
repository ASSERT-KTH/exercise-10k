  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a function as input and applies the function to the first two elements in the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until only one element remains.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfunction reduce_list(lst, func) {\n  while (lst.length > 1) {\n    lst = [func(lst[0], lst[1])].concat(lst.slice(2));\n  }\n  return lst[0];\n}\n```\nThis code takes a list `lst` and a function `func` as input, and applies the function to the list until only one element remains. The function is applied to the first two elements of the list, and the result is stored at the beginning of the list. This process is repeated until only one element remains, which is then returned as the result.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input list has at least two elements, and that the function `func` takes two arguments and returns a single value. If the input list has fewer than two elements, the code will not work as expected.",
