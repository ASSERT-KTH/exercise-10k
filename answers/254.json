  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two lists as input, and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are in either list but not in both.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing elements that are in either list but not in both. This function will enable you to find the symmetric difference between two lists. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing elements that are in either list but not in both.\n\n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): The first input list.\n    list2 (list): The second input list.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new list containing elements that are in either list but not in both.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Convert the input lists to sets for efficient set operations\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    \n    # Convert the second list to a set for the same reason\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetric difference of the two sets using the ^ operator\n    # The ^ operator returns a set with elements in either the set on the left or the right, but not both\n    symmetric_diff = set1 ^ set2\n    \n    # Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it\n    # We use list() function to convert the set back to a list because the problem requires a list as output\n    return list(symmetric_diff)\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(symmetric_difference(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `symmetric_difference` starts by converting the input lists `list1` and `list2` to sets `set1` and `set2`, respectively, to enable efficient set operations.\n* It then calculates the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2` using the `^` operator, which returns a set containing elements that are in either set but not both, and stores the result in `symmetric_diff`.\n* Finally, the function converts the resulting set `symmetric_diff` back to a list using the `list()` function and returns it, providing the desired output.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `symmetric_difference` function with two lists `list1` and `list2`, and prints the resulting list containing elements that are in either list but not in both.",
