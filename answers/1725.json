  "answer": "**Removing Duplicates from a List of Numbers**\n=====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that removes duplicates from a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(numbers))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\n    unique_numbers = remove_duplicates(numbers)\n    print(\"Original List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"List without Duplicates:\", unique_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `remove_duplicates` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It converts the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values.\n3. The set is then converted back to a list.\n4. The function returns the new list with duplicates removed.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program does not preserve the original order of the numbers. If preserving order is important, a different approach can be used.\n* This program assumes that the input list only contains hashable types (like numbers or strings). If the list contains unhashable types (like lists or dictionaries), a different approach will be needed.\n\n**Preserving Order (Optional)**\n------------------------------\n\nIf you need to preserve the original order of the numbers, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a list of numbers while preserving order.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    unique_numbers = [x for x in numbers if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n    return unique_numbers\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\n    unique_numbers = remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers)\n    print(\"Original List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"List without Duplicates:\", unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a list comprehension and a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. It only adds a number to the new list if it has not been seen before. This approach preserves the original order of the numbers.",
