  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their greatest common divisor",
  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following is a Python function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n```python\nprint(gcd(12, 15))  # Output: 3\nprint(gcd(24, 30))  # Output: 6\nprint(gcd(7, 11))   # Output: 1\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for calculating the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero. At this point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\nThe `abs` function is used to ensure that the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n**Note**\n-----\n\nThis function assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you need to calculate the GCD of floating-point numbers, you will need to use a different algorithm.",
