  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a title (i.e., the first character of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase), False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to determine if a given string is a title, where the first character of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. This solution will involve creating a function that checks each word in the string against these criteria. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_title(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string is a title.\n    \n    A string is considered a title if the first character of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the string is a title, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # If the word is empty, it's not a title\n        if not word:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase\n        if not (word[0].isupper() and word[1:].islower()):\n            return False\n    \n    # If we've checked all words and haven't returned False, the string is a title\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_title(s)` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into words using the `split()` method, storing them in the `words` list.\n* It then iterates over each `word` in the `words` list, checking if the word is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`.\n* For non-empty words, the function checks if the first character is uppercase using `word[0].isupper()` and if the rest of the characters are lowercase using `word[1:].islower()`. If either condition is not met, the function returns `False`.\n* If the function completes the iteration over all words without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the input string is a title.",
