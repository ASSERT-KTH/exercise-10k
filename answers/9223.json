  "prompt": "Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses conditional statements to determine a student's grade based on their score.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is {grade}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and uses conditional statements to determine the grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, ensures it's a valid number between 0 and 100, and then calls the `calculate_grade` function to determine the grade.\n3. The grade is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a score of 92, the program will output: \"The student's grade is A.\"\n* If the user enters a score of 75, the program will output: \"The student's grade is C.\"\n* If the user enters a score of 55, the program will output: \"The student's grade is F.\"",
