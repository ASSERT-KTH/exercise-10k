  "answer": "**Checking Anagrams with a For Loop**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any white spaces and convert to lower case\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Create a copy of the second string\n    str2_copy = list(str2)\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        # Check if the character exists in the copy of the second string\n        if char in str2_copy:\n            # Remove the character from the copy of the second string\n            str2_copy.remove(char)\n        else:\n            # If the character does not exist, the strings are not anagrams\n            return False\n\n    # If we have checked all characters and removed them from the copy of the second string,\n    # the strings are anagrams\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"Listen\"\n    str2 = \"Silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n\n    str1 = \"Hello\"\n    str2 = \"World\"\n    print(f\"Are '{str1}' and '{str2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(str1, str2)}\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams of each other.\n2. The function first removes any white spaces from the strings and converts them to lower case to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. If the lengths of the strings are not equal, the function immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4. The function creates a copy of the second string and iterates over each character in the first string.\n5. For each character in the first string, the function checks if the character exists in the copy of the second string. If it does, the character is removed from the copy of the second string.\n6. If a character in the first string does not exist in the copy of the second string, the function immediately returns `False`.\n7. If the function has checked all characters in the first string and removed them from the copy of the second string, the function returns `True`, indicating that the strings are anagrams.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nAre 'Listen' and 'Silent' anagrams? True\nAre 'Hello' and 'World' anagrams? False\n```",
