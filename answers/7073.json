  "answer": "**ASCII Value Printer**\n\nBelow is a Python program that reads a character from the user and prints its ASCII value.\n\n```python\ndef print_ascii_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a character from the user and prints its ASCII value.\n    \"\"\"\n    char = input(\"Enter a character: \")\n    \n    # Check if user entered a single character\n    if len(char) != 1:\n        print(\"Error: Please enter a single character.\")\n        return\n    \n    ascii_value = ord(char)\n    print(f\"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ascii_value}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    print_ascii_value()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `input` function is used to read a character from the user.\n2. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of the character.\n3. The ASCII value is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a character. If you enter a single character, it will print the ASCII value of that character. If you enter more than one character, it will print an error message.\n\n```\nEnter a character: A\nThe ASCII value of 'A' is 65.\n```",
