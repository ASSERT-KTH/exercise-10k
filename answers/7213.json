  "answer": "### Anagram Checker Program\n#### Overview\nThis program checks if two input words are anagrams of each other using a while loop. It works by sorting the characters in each word and comparing the results.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two words are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        word1 (str): The first word.\n        word2 (str): The second word.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the words are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the words to lowercase and remove any whitespace\n    word1 = word1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    word2 = word2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the words have different lengths, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(word1) != len(word2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in each word\n    sorted_word1 = \"\"\n    sorted_word2 = \"\"\n    word1_list = list(word1)\n    word2_list = list(word2)\n    while word1_list:\n        min_index1 = 0\n        min_index2 = 0\n        for i in range(len(word1_list)):\n            if word1_list[i] < word1_list[min_index1]:\n                min_index1 = i\n        sorted_word1 += word1_list.pop(min_index1)\n    while word2_list:\n        for i in range(len(word2_list)):\n            if word2_list[i] < word2_list[min_index2]:\n                min_index2 = i\n        sorted_word2 += word2_list.pop(min_index2)\n\n    # Compare the sorted words\n    return sorted_word1 == sorted_word2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    word1 = \"listen\"\n    word2 = \"silent\"\n    if are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n        print(f'\"{word1}\" and \"{word2}\" are anagrams.')\n    else:\n        print(f'\"{word1}\" and \"{word2}\" are not anagrams.')\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `are_anagrams` function takes two words as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n*   It first converts the words to lowercase and removes any whitespace.\n*   If the words have different lengths, it immediately returns `False`.\n*   It then sorts the characters in each word using a while loop and compares the results.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `are_anagrams` function with an example.\n\n#### Advice\n\n*   This program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure. For large inputs, a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort would be preferable.\n*   This program assumes that the input words only contain letters and whitespace. If you need to handle other characters, you may need to modify the program accordingly.",
