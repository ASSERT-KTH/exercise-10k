  "answer": "### Currying Function Implementation\n\nHere's an implementation of a function that takes another function as input and returns its curried version. This example is written in Python.\n\n```python\ndef curry(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a curried version of the input function.\n    \n    Args:\n        func: The input function to be curried.\n    \n    Returns:\n        A curried version of the input function.\n    \"\"\"\n    def curried(*args, **kwargs):\n        if len(args) + len(kwargs) >= func.__code__.co_argcount:\n            return func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return lambda *x, **y: curried(*(args + x), **dict(kwargs, **y))\n    return curried\n\n# Example usage:\n\ndef add(a, b, c):\n    return a + b + c\n\ncurried_add = curry(add)\n\nprint(curried_add(1)(2)(3))  # Output: 6\nprint(curried_add(1, 2)(3))   # Output: 6\nprint(curried_add(1)(2, 3))   # Output: 6\nprint(curried_add(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `curry` function takes a function `func` as input and returns a new function `curried`. When `curried` is called, it checks if the number of arguments provided is sufficient to call the original function `func`. If it is, `curried` calls `func` with the provided arguments and returns the result.\n\nIf the number of arguments is insufficient, `curried` returns a new function that takes additional arguments. This new function is another instance of `curried`, but with the previously provided arguments prepended to the new arguments.\n\nThis process continues until sufficient arguments are provided to call the original function `func`, at which point the final result is computed and returned.\n\n### Advice\n\nTo curry a function, you can use the `curry` function provided above. Simply pass the function you want to curry as an argument to `curry`, and it will return a curried version of that function.\n\nFor example, if you have a function `add(a, b, c)` that takes three arguments, you can curry it by calling `curried_add = curry(add)`. You can then call `curried_add` with one, two, or three arguments, and it will return the corresponding partial application of the `add` function.",
