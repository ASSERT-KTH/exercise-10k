  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input and then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should then be printed out to the user.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program uses two separate functions: `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`, each taking the length and width of the rectangle as arguments.\n*   The `calculate_area` function returns the product of the length and width, while the `calculate_perimeter` function returns twice the sum of the length and width.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, calculates the area and perimeter using the respective functions, and then prints the results.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly, but not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nThe area of the rectangle is: 15.00\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is: 16.00\n```",
