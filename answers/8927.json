  "answer": "Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python code to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree:\n```python\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in the binary tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef find_path(root, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the path from the root to the target node.\n\n    Args:\n        root (Node): The root of the binary tree.\n        target (int): The value of the target node.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of node values representing the path from the root to the target node.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n\n    if root.value == target:\n        return [root.value]\n\n    left_path = find_path(root.left, target)\n    if left_path is not None:\n        return [root.value] + left_path\n\n    right_path = find_path(root.right, target)\n    if right_path is not None:\n        return [root.value] + right_path\n\n    return None\n\ndef find_lca(root, node1, node2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in the binary tree.\n\n    Args:\n        root (Node): The root of the binary tree.\n        node1 (int): The value of the first node.\n        node2 (int): The value of the second node.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The value of the lowest common ancestor node.\n    \"\"\"\n    path1 = find_path(root, node1)\n    path2 = find_path(root, node2)\n\n    if path1 is None or path2 is None:\n        return None\n\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(path1) and i < len(path2) and path1[i] == path2[i]:\n        i += 1\n\n    return path1[i - 1]\n\n# Example usage:\nroot = Node(1)\nroot.left = Node(2)\nroot.right = Node(3)\nroot.left.left = Node(4)\nroot.left.right = Node(5)\nroot.right.left = Node(6)\nroot.right.right = Node(7)\n\nnode1 = 4\nnode2 = 5\nlca = find_lca(root, node1, node2)\nprint(\"Lowest common ancestor of {} and {} is {}\".format(node1, node2, lca))\n```\nThis program defines a `Node` class to represent nodes in the binary tree, and two functions: `find_path` to find the path from the root to a target node, and `find_lca` to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes. The `find_lca` function uses the `find_path` function to find the paths from the root to both nodes, and then compares the paths to find the common ancestor.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the binary tree is not empty and that the nodes with the given values exist in the tree. If the tree is empty or if the nodes do not exist, the program will return `None`.",
