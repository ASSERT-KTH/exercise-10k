  "answer": "### Recursive Function with Type Hints\n#### Overview\nThe following example demonstrates a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given integer. This function utilizes type hints to specify the types of its arguments and return value.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The input integer.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the input integer.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input integer is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input integer must be non-negative.\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The function uses type hints to specify that `n` is an integer and the return value is also an integer.\n*   It first checks if the input integer is negative, in which case it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n` to calculate the factorial.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `factorial` function by calculating the factorial of the number 5.",
