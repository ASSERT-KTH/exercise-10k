  "prompt": "Perform bitwise operations on integer variables",
  "answer": "Here are some common bitwise operations that can be performed on integer variables:\n\n1. **Bitwise AND (&)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n2. **Bitwise OR (|)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n3. **Bitwise XOR (^)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n4. **Bitwise NOT (~)**: Flips the bits of the operand. If a bit is 1, it becomes 0, and if a bit is 0, it becomes 1.\n\n5. **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The left shift operator essentially multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.\n\n6. **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The right shift operator essentially divides the number by 2 for each shift.\n\nHere is a simple Python program that demonstrates these bitwise operations:\n\n```python\na = 5   # 101 in binary\nb = 3   # 011 in binary\n\nprint(\"Bitwise AND of\", a, \"and\", b, \"is:\", a & b)\nprint(\"Bitwise OR of\", a, \"and\", b, \"is:\", a | b)\nprint(\"Bitwise XOR of\", a, \"and\", b, \"is:\", a ^ b)\nprint(\"Bitwise NOT of\", a, \"is:\", ~a)\nprint(\"Left shift of\", a, \"by 1 is:\", a << 1)\nprint(\"Right shift of\", a, \"by 1 is:\", a >> 1)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the results of the bitwise operations. The binary representation of the numbers is given in the comments to help you understand how the bitwise operations work.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how each operation works on the given example:\n\n- **Bitwise AND (&)**: `101 & 011 = 001`, so `a & b = 1`.\n- **Bitwise OR (|)**: `101 | 011 = 111`, so `a | b = 7`.\n- **Bitwise XOR (^)**: `101 ^ 011 = 110`, so `a ^ b = 6`.\n- **Bitwise NOT (~)**: `~101 = ...111010`, so `~a = -6` (note: the actual result may vary depending on the system's word size).\n- **Left Shift (<<)**: `101 << 1 = 1010`, so `a << 1 = 10`.\n- **Right Shift (>>)**: `101 >> 1 = 10`, so `a >> 1 = 2`.",
