  "answer": "### Finding Students with a Specific Age in a Dictionary\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses a dictionary to store student names and their corresponding ages. We'll create a function to find students with a specific age.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_students_by_age(students, target_age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find students with a specific age in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n        target_age (int): The age to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of student names with the target age.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [name for name, age in students.items() if age == target_age]\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    students = {\n        \"John\": 20,\n        \"Alice\": 22,\n        \"Bob\": 20,\n        \"Charlie\": 21,\n        \"David\": 20\n    }\n\n    target_age = 20\n    result = find_students_by_age(students, target_age)\n\n    print(f\"Students with age {target_age}: {result}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `find_students_by_age` that takes two arguments: `students` (a dictionary) and `target_age` (an integer).\n2. Use a list comprehension to iterate over the `students` dictionary and find the students with the `target_age`.\n3. Return a list of student names with the `target_age`.\n4. In the example usage, create a sample `students` dictionary and set a `target_age` to 20.\n5. Call the `find_students_by_age` function with the `students` dictionary and `target_age`, and print the result.\n\n#### Output\n\n```\nStudents with age 20: ['John', 'Bob', 'David']\n```\n\nThis solution is concise, efficient, and easy to understand. The list comprehension allows us to find the students with the target age in a single line of code.",
