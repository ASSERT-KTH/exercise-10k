  "answer": "**Story Filler Program**\n=========================\n\nThis program takes a story with missing words as input and fills them in with user input.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input(prompt):\n    \"\"\"Gets user input for a specific prompt.\"\"\"\n    return input(prompt)\n\ndef fill_in_the_blanks(story):\n    \"\"\"Fills in the blanks in a story with user input.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Please provide the following words:\")\n    words = {\n        \"noun\": get_user_input(\"Enter a noun: \"),\n        \"adjective\": get_user_input(\"Enter an adjective: \"),\n        \"verb\": get_user_input(\"Enter a verb: \"),\n        \"place\": get_user_input(\"Enter a place: \"),\n        \"person\": get_user_input(\"Enter a person's name: \")\n    }\n    return story.format(**words)\n\ndef main():\n    story = \"\"\"\n    Yesterday, I saw a very {adjective} {noun} walking down the street.\n    I was walking to the {place} when I saw it {verb} towards me.\n    I was with my friend {person} and we were both very surprised.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Original Story:\")\n    print(story)\n    filled_in_story = fill_in_the_blanks(story)\n    print(\"\\nFilled-in Story:\")\n    print(filled_in_story)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_user_input` function prompts the user for input and returns the input value.\n2. The `fill_in_the_blanks` function takes a story with missing words as input and fills them in with user input.\n3. The `main` function defines a story with missing words and calls the `fill_in_the_blanks` function to fill in the blanks.\n4. The program then prints the original story and the filled-in story.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a noun, adjective, verb, place, and person's name. After entering the words, it will print the filled-in story.\n\n```\nPlease provide the following words:\nEnter a noun: cat\nEnter an adjective: happy\nEnter a verb: running\nEnter a place: park\nEnter a person's name: John\n\nOriginal Story:\nYesterday, I saw a very {adjective} {noun} walking down the street.\nI was walking to the {place} when I saw it {verb} towards me.\nI was with my friend {person} and we were both very surprised.\n\nFilled-in Story:\nYesterday, I saw a very happy cat walking down the street.\nI was walking to the park when I saw it running towards me.\nI was with my friend John and we were both very surprised.\n```",
