  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print out the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to print out the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence\na, b = 0, 1\n\n# Print the first term\nprint(a)\n\n# Print the remaining terms using a for loop\nfor i in range(9):\n    # Print the current term\n    print(b)\n    \n    # Calculate the next term\n    a, b = b, a + b\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print out the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n34\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We start by initializing the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence (`a` and `b`) to 0 and 1, respectively.\n2. We print the first term (`a`) immediately.\n3. Then, we use a for loop to print the remaining 9 terms. In each iteration of the loop, we print the current term (`b`) and then calculate the next term by swapping the values of `a` and `b` and adding the old value of `a` to the old value of `b`.\n4. After the loop finishes, we've printed all 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nNote: The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(n)` is the `n`th term of the sequence. This program uses an iterative approach to calculate the terms, which is more efficient than a recursive approach for large values of `n`.",
