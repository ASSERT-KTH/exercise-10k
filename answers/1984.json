  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines whether a given year is a leap year using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses the following rules to determine if a year is a leap year:\n\n* The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible by 400.\n\nThe `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter `2020` to see that it is a leap year.\n* Enter `2019` to see that it is not a leap year.\n* Enter `2000` to see that it is a leap year.\n* Enter `1900` to see that it is not a leap year.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file named `leap_year.py` and execute it using Python: `python leap_year.py`. Follow the prompt to enter a year, and the program will print whether the year is a leap year or not.",
