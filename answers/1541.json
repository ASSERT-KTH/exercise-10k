  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given list of integers. This response will provide a step-by-step solution to achieve this task. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum, starting with 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        # Add the current number to the total sum\n        total_sum += num\n    \n    # Return the total sum after iterating over all elements\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_sum(numbers))  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_sum` takes a list `lst` as input and initializes a variable `total_sum` to store the sum of all elements, starting with 0.\n*   It then iterates over each element `num` in the list using a for loop, adding the current number to `total_sum`.\n*   Finally, the function returns `total_sum` after iterating over all elements in the list.\n*   To test the function, a list of numbers is created and passed to the `calculate_sum` function, printing the result.",
