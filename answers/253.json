  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input, and returns a new array that contains only the elements that are in the first array but not in the second array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef diff_array(arr1, arr2) {\n  return arr1.filter(function(val) {\n    return arr2.indexOf(val) === -1;\n  });\n}\n```\nThis code defines a function `diff_array` that takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input, and returns a new array that contains only the elements that are present in `arr1` but not in `arr2`.\n\nThe `filter` method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The provided function checks if the current element `val` is not present in `arr2` by using the `indexOf` method, which returns `-1` if the element is not found.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the elements in the arrays are primitive values (such as numbers, strings, or booleans) and not objects or arrays themselves. If the elements are objects or arrays, a different approach would be needed to compare them.",
