It presents a menu to the user, asks for their choice, and then asks for the two numbers.\n*   Based on the user's choice, it calls the `calculator` function with the corresponding operator and prints the result.\n*   The program also includes error handling to catch cases where the user tries to divide by zero or enters an invalid choice.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n*   Addition: Enter `1` as your choice, then enter two numbers, and the program will display their sum.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `2` as your choice, then enter two numbers, and the program will display their difference.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `3` as your choice, then enter two numbers, and the program will display their product.\n*   Division: Enter `4` as your choice, then enter two numbers, and the program will display their quotient. If you try to divide by zero, it will display an error message.",
