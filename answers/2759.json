  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the discount amount given the original price and discount percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount amount.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discount amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    discount_amount = (original_price / 100) * discount_percentage\n    return discount_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    discount_amount = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)\n    print(f\"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Price after discount: ${original_price - discount_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function takes two arguments: `original_price` and `discount_percentage`.\n2. It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage divided by 100.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage.\n4. It calls the `calculate_discount` function and prints the discount amount and the price after discount.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Original price: $100\n* Discount percentage: 20%\n* Discount amount: $20\n* Price after discount: $80\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `discount_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python discount_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the original price and discount percentage. The program will display the discount amount and the price after discount.",
