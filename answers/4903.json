  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it is even or odd.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is even.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is odd.\")\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The program defines a function `check_even_odd` that takes an integer `num` as input.\n* Inside the function, it checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is 0 using the modulus operator `%`. If it is, then the number is even.\n* If the number is even, it prints a message saying so. Otherwise, it prints a message saying the number is odd.\n* The program then prompts the user to enter an integer using the `input` function, converts the input to an integer using `int`, and passes it to the `check_even_odd` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print `10 is even.`\n* If the user enters `11`, the program will print `11 is odd.`\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the user will enter a valid integer. If the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer (like a string or a floating-point number), the program will raise a `ValueError`. You may want to add error handling to deal with this case, depending on your needs. For example:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        num = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n        check_even_odd(num)\n        break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n```",
