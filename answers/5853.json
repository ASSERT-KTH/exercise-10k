  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their age and then prints out a message based on the following conditions: If the user is under 13, print 'You are a kid'; if the user is between 13 and 19, print 'You are a teenager'; if the user is 20 or older, print 'You are an adult'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_age_message():\n    # Ask the user for their age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Print a message based on the user's age\n    if age < 13:\n        print(\"You are a kid\")\n    elif 13 <= age <= 19:\n        print(\"You are a teenager\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are an adult\")\n\n# Run the function\nprint_age_message()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Get User Input**: The program starts by asking the user to enter their age. It uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid whole number.\n2. **Check the User's Age**: Once the user's age is validated, the program checks it against the specified conditions using `if-elif-else` statements.\n3. **Print the Corresponding Message**: Depending on the user's age, the program prints out one of the three messages: 'You are a kid', 'You are a teenager', or 'You are an adult'.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your age. Here's an example interaction:\n\n```\nPlease enter your age: 15\nYou are a teenager\n```\n\nYou can run the program and enter different ages to see the corresponding messages.",
