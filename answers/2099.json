The formula is:\n\nr = cov(x, y) / (\u03c3x * \u03c3y)\n\nwhere:\n\n* r is the correlation coefficient\n* cov(x, y) is the covariance of x and y\n* \u03c3x is the standard deviation of x\n* \u03c3y is the standard deviation of y\n\nThe program first calculates the means of x and y, then calculates the deviations from the means. It then calculates the covariance and variances of x and y, and finally calculates the correlation coefficient using the formula above.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Analyzing the relationship between two variables in a dataset\n* Determining the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables\n* Identifying correlations between different variables in a dataset\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis program assumes that the input lists are of equal length and contain only numerical values. If the input lists are of different lengths or contain non-numerical values, the program may produce incorrect results or raise an error.",
