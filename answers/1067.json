  "answer": "**Coin Toss Simulator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to simulate a coin toss and keep track of the number of heads and tails.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_toss_simulator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a coin toss and keeps track of the number of heads and tails.\n    \"\"\"\n    heads = 0\n    tails = 0\n    num_tosses = 0\n\n    while True:\n        # Simulate a coin toss\n        toss = random.choice([\"Heads\", \"Tails\"])\n        num_tosses += 1\n\n        # Update the count\n        if toss == \"Heads\":\n            heads += 1\n        else:\n            tails += 1\n\n        # Print the result\n        print(f\"Toss {num_tosses}: {toss}\")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to continue\n        response = input(\"Do you want to toss again? (yes/no): \")\n        if response.lower() != \"yes\":\n            break\n\n    # Print the final results\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Tosses: {num_tosses}\")\n    print(f\"Heads: {heads} ({heads / num_tosses * 100:.2f}%)\")\n    print(f\"Tails: {tails} ({tails / num_tosses * 100:.2f}%)\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    coin_toss_simulator()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will simulate a coin toss and print the result.\n3. You will be prompted to continue or stop the simulation.\n4. If you choose to continue, the program will simulate another coin toss.\n5. Once you choose to stop, the program will print the final results, including the total number of tosses, the number of heads and tails, and the percentage of each.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `random.choice` function is used to simulate a coin toss.\n* The `while` loop continues to simulate coin tosses until the user chooses to stop.\n* The program keeps track of the number of heads and tails and calculates the percentage of each.",
