  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane, explaining the steps and providing a clear understanding of the solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to unpack the coordinates of the two points\n    x1, y1 = point1  # Unpack the x and y coordinates of the first point\n    x2, y2 = point2  # Unpack the x and y coordinates of the second point\n\n    # Then, we calculate the difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates\n    dx = x2 - x1  # Difference between the x-coordinates\n    dy = y2 - y1  # Difference between the y-coordinates\n\n    # Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance\n    # The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the distance) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides\n    distance_squared = dx ** 2 + dy ** 2  # Calculate the square of the distance\n\n    # Finally, we take the square root of the distance squared to get the actual distance\n    distance = math.sqrt(distance_squared)  # Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem\n\n    return distance  # Return the calculated distance\n\n# Example usage:\npoint1 = (1, 2)\npoint2 = (4, 6)\nprint(calculate_distance(point1, point2))  # Output: 5.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_distance` takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points in the 2D plane. It unpacks these tuples into `x1`, `y1` and `x2`, `y2` to access the x and y coordinates individually.\n* The differences between the x-coordinates (`dx`) and y-coordinates (`dy`) are calculated to determine the lengths of the two sides of the right-angled triangle formed by the two points.\n* The Pythagorean theorem is applied by squaring `dx` and `dy`, summing them (`distance_squared`), and then taking the square root of this sum to find the actual distance (`distance`) between the two points.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated `distance`, providing the result of the distance calculation between the two input points.",
