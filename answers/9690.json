  "prompt": "Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_grade` function takes an integer `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade as a string.\n2. **Grade Calculation**: The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n   - If the score is 90 or above, it returns \"A\".\n   - If the score is between 80 and 89, it returns \"B\".\n   - If the score is between 70 and 79, it returns \"C\".\n   - If the score is between 60 and 69, it returns \"D\".\n   - If the score is below 60, it returns \"F\".\n3. **Main Function**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter a score, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n4. **Example Usage**: The program uses the `main` function to demonstrate how to use the `calculate_grade` function with user input.",
