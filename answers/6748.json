  "answer": "**Declaring and Printing the Value of Pi**\n\nHere is an example code snippet in Python that declares a constant variable to store the value of pi and prints it to the console:\n\n```python\n# Import the math module for the value of pi\nimport math\n\n# Declare a constant variable to store the value of pi\nPI = math.pi\n\n# Print the value of pi to the console\nprint(\"The value of pi is:\", PI)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We import the `math` module, which provides the value of pi as `math.pi`.\n2. We declare a constant variable `PI` and assign it the value of `math.pi`.\n3. We print the value of `PI` to the console using the `print()` function.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe value of pi is: 3.14159265359\n```\n\nNote: In Python, it's conventional to use uppercase letters with underscores to denote constant variables, as shown in the code snippet above.",
