  "answer": "**Cricket Score Printer Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for the score of a cricket match and then prints out the score in the format 'team_name score/overs'.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_team_name(team_number):\n    \"\"\"Get the team name from the user.\"\"\"\n    team_name = input(f\"Enter the name of team {team_number}: \")\n    return team_name\n\ndef get_score():\n    \"\"\"Get the score from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n            overs = int(input(\"Enter the overs: \"))\n            if overs <= 0:\n                print(\"Overs must be greater than 0.\")\n                continue\n            return score, overs\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid score and overs.\")\n\ndef print_score(team_name, score, overs):\n    \"\"\"Print the score in the format 'team_name score/overs'.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"{team_name} {score}/{overs}\")\n\ndef main():\n    team_name = get_team_name(1)\n    score, overs = get_score()\n    print_score(team_name, score, overs)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter the name of the team, the score, and the overs. After you enter this information, it will print out the score in the format 'team_name score/overs'.\n\n```\nEnter the name of team 1: Australia\nEnter the score: 100\nEnter the overs: 2\nAustralia 100/2\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid score and overs.\n* It uses `try`/`except` blocks to catch any `ValueError` exceptions that may occur when trying to convert the user's input to integers.\n* It uses an `if` statement to check if the overs are greater than 0.\n* The `get_team_name`, `get_score`, and `print_score` functions are separate to make the code more modular and reusable.",
