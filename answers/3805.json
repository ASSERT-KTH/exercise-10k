  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the user.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of rock-paper-scissors.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == \"q\":\n            break\n        elif user_choice.lower() not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        \n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        \n        print(determine_winner(user_choice.lower(), computer_choice))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user for their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.\n2. **Computer Choice**: The `get_computer_choice()` function generates a random choice for the computer.\n3. **Determine Winner**: The `determine_winner()` function compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner of the game.\n4. **Game Loop**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly play the game until the user chooses to quit by entering 'q'.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' to play a game.\n* Enter 'q' to quit the game.\n* Enter an invalid choice (e.g., 'abc') to see an error message.\n\nNote: This code uses Python's built-in `random` module to generate random choices for the computer. The `get_computer_choice()` function returns a random choice from the list `[\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]`.",
