The `main` function handles the user input and calls the `arithmetic_operation` function.\n\n*   The program first prints a menu with the available operations and asks the user to input two numbers and choose an operation.\n*   Based on the user's choice, it determines the operation to be performed.\n*   It then calls the `arithmetic_operation` function with the two numbers and the chosen operation.\n*   The `arithmetic_operation` function performs the operation and returns the result. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n*   If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The `main` function catches any exceptions raised by the `arithmetic_operation` function and prints an error message if necessary.\n*   Finally, it prints the result of the operation if it was successful.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Input `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and choose `addition` or enter `+` as the operation. The program will output `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Input `20` as the first number, `8` as the second number, and choose `subtraction` or enter `-` as the operation. The program will output `20 - 8 = 12.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Input `4` as the first number, `9` as the second number, and choose `multiplication` or enter `*` as the operation. The program will output `4 * 9 = 36.0`.\n*   Division: Input `18` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and choose `division` or enter `/` as the operation. The program will output `18 / 3 = 6.0`.",
