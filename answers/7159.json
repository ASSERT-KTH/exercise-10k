  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade. The grading scale is as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements (if/else) to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int score;\n    cout << \"Enter your score: \";\n    cin >> score;\n\n    if (score >= 90) {\n        cout << \"Your grade is A\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 80) {\n        cout << \"Your grade is B\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 70) {\n        cout << \"Your grade is C\" << endl;\n    } else if (score >= 60) {\n        cout << \"Your grade is D\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Your grade is F\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the specifications exactly, including the header file, namespace, and `main` function. It prompts the user to enter their score, reads the input, and then uses a series of `if` and `else if` statements to determine the corresponding grade based on the score. Finally, it outputs the grade to the console using `cout`.",
