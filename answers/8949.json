  "answer": "**Assignment Operators Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that demonstrates the use of assignment operators.\n\n```python\n# Define a variable and assign a value\nx = 10\nprint(\"Initial value of x:\", x)\n\n# Addition assignment operator\nx += 5\nprint(\"Value of x after x += 5:\", x)\n\n# Subtraction assignment operator\nx -= 3\nprint(\"Value of x after x -= 3:\", x)\n\n# Multiplication assignment operator\nx *= 2\nprint(\"Value of x after x *= 2:\", x)\n\n# Division assignment operator\nx /= 2\nprint(\"Value of x after x /= 2:\", x)\n\n# Modulus assignment operator\nx %= 3\nprint(\"Value of x after x %= 3:\", x)\n\n# Exponentiation assignment operator\nx **= 2\nprint(\"Value of x after x **= 2:\", x)\n\n# Floor division assignment operator\nx = 10\nx //= 3\nprint(\"Value of x after x //= 3:\", x)\n```\n\n**Output**\n-----------\n\n```\nInitial value of x: 10\nValue of x after x += 5: 15\nValue of x after x -= 3: 12\nValue of x after x *= 2: 24\nValue of x after x /= 2: 12.0\nValue of x after x %= 3: 0.0\nValue of x after x **= 2: 0.0\nValue of x after x //= 3: 3\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe program uses the following assignment operators:\n\n*   `+=` (addition assignment)\n*   `-=` (subtraction assignment)\n*   `*=` (multiplication assignment)\n*   `/=` (division assignment)\n*   `%=` (modulus assignment)\n*   `**=` (exponentiation assignment)\n*   `//=` (floor division assignment)\n\nEach operator performs the corresponding operation and assigns the result back to the variable `x`. The program prints the value of `x` after each operation to demonstrate the effect of the assignment operators.",
