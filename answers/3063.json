  "prompt": "Create a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules and print out the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'Tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'User'\n    return 'Computer'\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nUser chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'Tie':\n            print(f\"It's a tie!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"The {winner} wins!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Getting the Computer's Choice**: The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']`.\n2. **Determining the Winner**: The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. **Main Game Loop**: The `main` function contains the game loop, where the user is prompted to enter their choice. The program checks if the user wants to quit or if their choice is valid. If the choice is valid, the computer's choice is generated, and the winner is determined.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: rock\n\nUser chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nThe User wins!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \n```",
