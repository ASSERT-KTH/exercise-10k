It provides methods to add, remove, search, and display contacts.\n\nThe `main` function creates a `Phonebook` object and presents a menu to the user. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding method on the `Phonebook` object.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n1. Add a contact:\n\t* Run the program and choose option 1 (Add contact).\n\t* Enter the contact name and phone number.\n\t* The program will add the contact to the phonebook and display a success message.\n2. Remove a contact:\n\t* Run the program and choose option 2 (Remove contact).\n\t* Enter the name of the contact to be removed.\n\t* The program will remove the contact from the phonebook and display a success message.\n3. Search for a contact:\n\t* Run the program and choose option 3 (Search contact).\n\t* Enter the name of the contact to be searched.\n\t* The program will display the phone number of the contact if found.\n4. Display all contacts:\n\t* Run the program and choose option 4 (Display contacts).\n\t* The program will display all contacts in the phonebook.",
