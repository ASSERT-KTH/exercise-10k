The `longest_increasing_subsequence` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the longest increasing subsequence.\n2.  It first checks if the input list is empty and returns an empty list if it is.\n3.  It then initializes two lists: `lengths` to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position, and `subsequences` to store the actual subsequences.\n4.  The function then iterates over the input list, comparing each number with all previous numbers. If a number is greater than a previous number and the length of the subsequence ending at the current position is less than the length of the subsequence ending at the previous position plus one, it updates the length and subsequence.\n5.  Finally, it finds the longest increasing subsequence by finding the maximum length and the corresponding index, and returns the subsequence at that index.\n6.  The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `longest_increasing_subsequence` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Output**\n----------------\n\n```\nInput list: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]\nLongest increasing subsequence: [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80]\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it uses two nested loops to compare each number with all previous numbers. The space complexity is O(n), as it stores the lengths and subsequences for each position in the input list.",
