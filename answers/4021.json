  "answer": "**Reversing an Array Function**\n================================\n\nHere's a simple function written in Python that reverses the order of elements in an array.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef reverse_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the order of elements in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The reversed array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return arr[::-1]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(\"Original array:\", array)\n    print(\"Reversed array:\", reverse_array(array))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses Python's slice notation `arr[start:stop:step]`.\n*   By setting `start` and `stop` to their default values (None) and `step` to -1 (`[::-1]`), we're telling Python to start at the end of the array and move backwards to the beginning, stepping backwards by 1 element each time.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nReversed array: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because Python's slice notation creates a new list by iterating over the original list.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nIf you want to implement the reverse function manually without using Python's slice notation, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_array(arr):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        # Swap elements at left and right indices\n        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis approach also has a time complexity of O(n) because it only requires a single pass through the array. However, it modifies the original array in-place, whereas the slice notation approach creates a new array.",
