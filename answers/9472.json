  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should use a basic algorithm to iterate over the array and keep track of the maximum value found so far.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on your detailed specification:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def maxElement(self, arr):\n        max = arr[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[i] > max:\n                max = arr[i]\n        return max\n\n# Testing the function\narr = [10, 324, 45, 90, 9808]\nprint(Solution().maxElement(arr))  # Output: 9808\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification to ensure that the code meets all the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
