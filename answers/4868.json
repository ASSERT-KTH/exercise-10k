  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using a for loop. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).\n5. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n7. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23 or 37, to see the program confirm that it's prime.\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 4 or 6, to see the program confirm that it's not prime.\n* Enter a number less than or equal to 1, such as 0 or 1, to see the program correctly identify it as not prime.",
