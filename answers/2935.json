  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess correctly, with a limited number of attempts.",
  "answer": "Here's the code based on the provided specification:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nsecret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\nattempts = 5\n\nwhile attempts > 0:\n    guess = int(input(\"Guess a number: \"))\n    attempts -= 1\n\n    if guess < secret_number:\n        print(\"Higher!\")\n    elif guess > secret_number:\n        print(\"Lower!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You guessed it!\")\n        break\n\nif attempts == 0:\n    print(\"You ran out of guesses!\")\n    print(\"The secret number was\", secret_number)\n```\n\nThis code follows the provided specification and generates a secret number between 1 and 100. It then repeatedly asks the user for their guess until they guess correctly or run out of attempts. The program provides feedback to the user after each guess, telling them whether their guess was higher or lower than the secret number. If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates them and ends. If the user runs out of attempts, the program reveals the secret number.",
