  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = np.mean(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = np.median(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    std_dev = np.std(numbers)\n\n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n    print(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Importing Libraries**: The `numpy` library is imported for its built-in functions to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n2. **Defining the Function**: The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation using `np.mean`, `np.median`, and `np.std` respectively.\n3. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, an example list of numbers is provided, and the `calculate_statistics` function is called with this list.\n4. **Printing Results**: The calculated mean, median, and standard deviation are then printed to the console.\n\n### Running the Program:\nTo run the program, save it in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `statistics.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python statistics.py`). The program will output the mean, median, and standard deviation of the example list of numbers. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to calculate the statistics for different sets of numbers.",
