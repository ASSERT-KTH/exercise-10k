  "answer": "**Coin Flip Simulator**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a coin flip game. The game continues until the user decides to quit.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    \"\"\"Simulate a coin flip and return the result.\"\"\"\n    return \"Heads\" if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else \"Tails\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Coin Flip Simulator!\")\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    \n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        print(f\"\\nYou flipped a coin and got: {coin_flip()}\")\n        play_again = input(\"Do you want to flip again? (y/n): \")\n        \n        # Validate user input\n        while play_again.lower() not in [\"y\", \"n\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no: \")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `coin_flip` function simulates a coin flip by generating a random integer (0 or 1) and returning \"Heads\" if the number is 0, and \"Tails\" if the number is 1.\n2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It contains a while loop that continues to run as long as the user wants to play again.\n3. Inside the loop, the program simulates a coin flip and prints the result.\n4. The user is then asked if they want to flip again. If they enter 'y', the loop continues. If they enter 'n', the loop exits, and the program ends.\n5. The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters either 'y' or 'n'. If the user enters anything else, they are prompted to try again.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `coin_flip.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python coin_flip.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
