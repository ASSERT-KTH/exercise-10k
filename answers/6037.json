  "prompt": "Create a function that finds the index of a given element in a list. Use the function to find the index of the element 'b' in the list ['a', 'b', 'c'].",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that finds the index of a given element in a list and use it to find the index of a specific element. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, elem):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of a given element in a list.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    lst (list): The list to search in.\n    elem: The element to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Try to find the index of the element in the list\n    try:\n        # Use the index method of the list to find the index of the element\n        index = lst.index(elem)\n        \n        # Return the index\n        return index\n    \n    # If the element is not found, the index method will raise a ValueError\n    except ValueError:\n        # Return -1 to indicate that the element was not found\n        return -1\n\n# Use the function to find the index of 'b' in ['a', 'b', 'c']\nprint(find_index(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'b'))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `find_index` function takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to search in) and `elem` (the element to search for). It returns the index of the element if found, and -1 otherwise.\n* Inside the function, a `try` block attempts to find the index of the element using the `index` method of the list. If successful, it returns the index.\n* If the element is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns -1 to indicate that the element was not found.\n* The function is then used to find the index of 'b' in the list ['a', 'b', 'c'], and the result is printed to the console.",
