  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator Program**\n\n### Overview\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci formula, taking the user's input as the number of terms to generate.\n\n### Formula\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Fibonacci sequence of 'n' terms.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of terms from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            n = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms to generate: \"))\n            if n > 0:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n\n    # Generate and print the Fibonacci sequence\n    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(\"Fibonacci Sequence:\")\n    print(fib_sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of terms to generate when prompted (e.g., `10`).\n3. The program will print the Fibonacci sequence of the specified length.\n\n### Output\n```\nEnter the number of terms to generate: 10\nFibonacci Sequence:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\n### Notes\n* This program uses a simple iterative approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence.\n* The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers.\n* The `main` function handles user input, generates the Fibonacci sequence, and prints the result.",
