  "prompt": "Write a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to a given number. Use the function to double a number.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a higher-order function that applies a given function to a number, and then use it to double a number. This will involve defining a function that takes another function and a number as arguments, and then applies the provided function to the number. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# First, we define a higher-order function that takes another function and a number as arguments.\ndef apply_function(func, num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a given function to a number.\n\n    Args:\n        func (function): The function to be applied.\n        num (int or float): The number to which the function is applied.\n\n    Returns:\n        result: The result of applying the function to the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We then apply the given function to the number and return the result.\n    return func(num)\n\n# Next, we define a function that doubles a number.\ndef double(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Doubles a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        x (int or float): The number to be doubled.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The double of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We simply return the number multiplied by 2.\n    return x * 2\n\n# Finally, we use the higher-order function to double a number.\nprint(apply_function(double, 5))  # Outputs: 10\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `apply_function` is defined to take another function `func` and a number `num` as arguments. It applies `func` to `num` and returns the result.\n* A separate function `double` is defined to take a number `x` and return its double by multiplying it by 2.\n* The `apply_function` is then used with `double` as the provided function and a number (in this case, 5) to demonstrate how it can be used to double a number.\n* The result of applying `double` to 5 through `apply_function` is printed, which outputs 10.",
