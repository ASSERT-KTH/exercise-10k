  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to n, and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n, but shifted by the row number. For example, if n is 3, the pattern should be: 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5. The input will be a single integer n.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Purpose: To print a pattern of numbers using loops.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n        print((i + j - 1), end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they would typically be filled in by the person writing the code. You can fill in your own name and date if you like!",
