  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): \")\n    \n    try:\n        result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation} is {result}.\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n- The `arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input.\n- It then checks the operation and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n- If the operation is division and the second number is zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n- If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls the `arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result.\n- If an error occurs, it catches the exception and prints the error message.",
