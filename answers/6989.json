  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers.\")\n\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and height from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the area\n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is {area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_triangle_area` that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns its area. The `main` function gets the base and height from the user, calculates the area, and prints it. If the user enters a non-positive number for the base or height, the program raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.",
