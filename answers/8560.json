  "answer": "### Dictionary Creation and Clearance\n\nBelow is an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to create a dictionary with 3 key-value pairs and then clear it:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary with 3 key-value pairs\nmy_dict = {\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n    \"key2\": \"value2\",\n    \"key3\": \"value3\"\n}\n\n# Print the created dictionary\nprint(\"Created Dictionary:\", my_dict)\n\n# Clear the dictionary\nmy_dict.clear()\n\n# Print the dictionary after clearance\nprint(\"Dictionary after clearance:\", my_dict)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will first create a dictionary named `my_dict` with three key-value pairs, print the created dictionary, clear the dictionary using the `clear()` method, and then print the dictionary again to show that it has been cleared.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nCreated Dictionary: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}\nDictionary after clearance: {}\n```",
