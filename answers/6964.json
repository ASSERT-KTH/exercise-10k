  "answer": "### Prime Number Checker Function\n#### Overview\nThis function checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # Check if n is divisible by any number up to its square root\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If n is divisible, it's not prime\n            return False\n    # If n is not divisible by any number, it's prime\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_prime(25))  # False\n    print(is_prime(23))  # True\n    print(is_prime(37))  # True\n    print(is_prime(48))  # False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThe `is_prime` function works by checking if the input number `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n\n1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n2. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root (inclusive).\n3. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n4. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it's prime, so the function returns `True`.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(\u221an), which is more efficient than checking all the way up to `n`.",
