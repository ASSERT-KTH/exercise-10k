  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a dictionary of student grades where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student's name as the key and their average grade as the value.",

The function iterates over each student in the input dictionary, calculates the average grade for each student, and stores the results in a new dictionary. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample dictionary of student grades and prints the resulting dictionary of average grades.",
