  "answer": "**Arithmetic Expression Evaluator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program takes an arithmetic expression as input and outputs its result. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates an arithmetic expression and returns the result.\n\n    Args:\n        expression (str): The arithmetic expression to evaluate.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    expression = input(\"Enter an arithmetic expression: \")\n    result = evaluate_expression(expression)\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The result of the expression is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Evaluate a simple arithmetic expression: `2 + 3`\n*   Evaluate an expression with multiple operators: `2 + 3 * 4`\n*   Evaluate an expression with decimal numbers: `2.5 + 3.7`\n*   Evaluate an expression with division: `10 / 2`\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1.  The `evaluate_expression` function takes an arithmetic expression as input and uses the `eval` function to evaluate it.\n2.  The `eval` function parses the expression and executes it as Python code.\n3.  The result of the expression is returned by the `evaluate_expression` function.\n4.  In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter an arithmetic expression.\n5.  The entered expression is passed to the `evaluate_expression` function, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n**Note**: The `eval` function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input, as it can evaluate any Python code. In this example, we assume that the input is trusted. If you need to evaluate untrusted input, consider using a safer evaluation method, such as using a parsing library or writing a custom parser.",
