  "answer": "### Creating a Dictionary and Its Copy\n\nBelow is an example of how to create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs and then create a copy of it using the `.copy()` method in Python:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs\noriginal_dict = {\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n    \"key2\": \"value2\",\n    \"key3\": \"value3\",\n    \"key4\": \"value4\",\n    \"key5\": \"value5\"\n}\n\n# Create a copy of the dictionary using the .copy() method\ncopied_dict = original_dict.copy()\n\n# Print the original and copied dictionaries to verify the copy\nprint(\"Original Dictionary:\", original_dict)\nprint(\"Copied Dictionary:\", copied_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `original_dict` is created with 5 key-value pairs.\n- The `.copy()` method is used to create a shallow copy of `original_dict` and assign it to `copied_dict`.\n- Both dictionaries are printed to the console to verify that the copy was successful.\n\n### Note\n\nThe `.copy()` method creates a shallow copy, which means it constructs a new dictionary and (to the extent possible) inserts references to the original elements. This is sufficient for immutable types like strings and integers but may not be ideal for mutable types like lists or other dictionaries, as changes to those mutable elements will be reflected in both the original and copied dictionaries. For deep copying (including mutable elements), consider using the `copy` module's `deepcopy` function.",
