  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get the score from the user\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n# Determine the grade using conditional statements\nif score >= 90:\n    print(\"Grade: A\")\nelif score >= 80:\n    print(\"Grade: B\")\nelif score >= 70:\n    print(\"Grade: C\")\nelif score >= 60:\n    print(\"Grade: D\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Grade: F\")\n```\nThis code asks the user to enter their score, converts the input to an integer, and then uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to determine the grade based on the score. The grade is then printed out to the console.",
