  "answer": "### Scrambling Letters in a String\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function takes a string as input, splits it into words, scrambles the letters in each word, and returns the resulting string.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_string(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles the letters in each word of a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to be scrambled.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled string.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = input_string.split()\n    scrambled_words = []\n\n    for word in words:\n        # Separate punctuation from the word\n        punctuation = ''\n        while word and not word[-1].isalpha():\n            punctuation = word[-1] + punctuation\n            word = word[:-1]\n\n        # Scramble the word\n        scrambled_word = list(word)\n        random.shuffle(scrambled_word)\n        scrambled_word = ''.join(scrambled_word) + punctuation\n\n        scrambled_words.append(scrambled_word)\n\n    return ' '.join(scrambled_words)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Input String:\", input_string)\n    print(\"Scrambled String:\", scramble_string(input_string))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function splits the input string into words using the `split` method.\n2. It then iterates over each word, separating any punctuation from the end of the word.\n3. The letters in the word are scrambled using the `random.shuffle` function.\n4. The scrambled word is then joined back with its punctuation (if any).\n5. Finally, the scrambled words are joined back into a string using the `join` method.\n\nNote that this function preserves the original punctuation and capitalization of the input string. If you want to modify these, you can add additional code to handle them accordingly.",
