  "prompt": "Create a program that defines a function to perform basic arithmetic operations. The function should take two numbers and an operator as input and return the result of the operation. The operators to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handle invalid operators and division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n    // Function to perform arithmetic operations\n    double arithmetic(double x, double y, char op) {\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+':\n                return x + y;\n            case '-':\n                return x - y;\n            case '*':\n                return x * y;\n            case '/':\n                if (y == 0) {\n                    throw std::runtime_error(\"Division by zero!\");\n                }\n                return x / y;\n            default:\n                throw std::invalid_argument(\"Invalid operator!\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Example usage\n    double x = 10.0;\n    double y = 2.0;\n    char op = '+';\n\n    try {\n        double result = arithmetic(x, y, op);\n        std::cout << \"Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that I've included the necessary `#include <iostream>` directive to include the iostream standard file, which is required for input/output operations. I've also included the `std::` prefix for standard library classes and functions, such as `std::runtime_error` and `std::invalid_argument`, to ensure that the code is compiled correctly.",
