  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(array):\n    if not array:\n        return None\n    return max(array)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1]\nmax_number = find_max_number(numbers)\nprint(\"Max number:\", max_number)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `find_max_number` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the array. If the array is empty, it returns `None`. The `max` function is a built-in Python function that returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.\n\nYou can also implement this function manually without using the built-in `max` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(array):\n    if not array:\n        return None\n    max_number = array[0]\n    for num in array:\n        if num > max_number:\n            max_number = num\n    return max_number\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1]\nmax_number = find_max_number(numbers)\nprint(\"Max number:\", max_number)\n```\n\nThis version of the function iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum number found so far. It initially assumes the first number in the array is the maximum, and then updates this assumption as it iterates through the rest of the array.",
