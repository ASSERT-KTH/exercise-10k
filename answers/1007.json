  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among all the strings.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):\n        if not strs:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        short_str = min(strs, key=len)\n        for i, ch in enumerate(short_str):\n            for other in strs:\n                if other[i] != ch:\n                    return short_str[:i]\n        return short_str\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(Solution().longestCommonPrefix([\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\nThis code defines a class `Solution` with a method `longestCommonPrefix` that takes an array of strings `strs` as input and returns the longest common prefix among all the strings. The method follows the algorithm described in the specification, finding the shortest string, iterating over each character of the shortest string, and checking if the character is the same in all other strings. If a mismatch is found, the method returns the prefix up to the mismatch. If no mismatch is found, the method returns the entire shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.",
