  "prompt": "Create a function that uses the map function to double all numbers in a list. Use the function to double the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that doubles all numbers in a list using the `map` function and demonstrate its usage with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# First, we define a function that doubles a number.\ndef double(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function doubles a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (int or float): The number to be doubled.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The doubled number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We simply return the number multiplied by 2.\n    return number * 2\n\n# Now, we use the map function to double all numbers in a list.\ndef double_all_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function doubles all numbers in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be doubled.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with all numbers doubled.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We use the map function to apply the double function to each number in the list.\n    # The map function returns a map object, so we convert it to a list.\n    doubled_numbers = list(map(double, numbers))\n    # We return the new list with all numbers doubled.\n    return doubled_numbers\n\n# Finally, we use the function to double the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ndoubled_numbers = double_all_numbers(numbers)\nprint(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The solution starts by defining a helper function `double` that takes a `number` as input and returns its double by multiplying it by 2.\n* A main function `double_all_numbers` is then defined, which takes a list of `numbers` as input and uses the `map` function to apply the `double` function to each number in the list.\n* The `map` function returns a map object, which is converted to a list using the `list` function and stored in `doubled_numbers`.\n* Finally, the `double_all_numbers` function is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as an argument, and the resulting list of doubled numbers is printed.",
