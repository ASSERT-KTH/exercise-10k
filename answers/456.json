  "answer": "**Math Quiz Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user a series of math questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport operator\n\n# Define the operators and their corresponding functions\noperators = {\n    '+': operator.add,\n    '-': operator.sub,\n    '*': operator.mul,\n    '/': operator.truediv\n}\n\ndef math_quiz(num_questions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user a series of math questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n    Args:\n        num_questions (int): The number of questions to ask the user.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    score = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_questions):\n        # Generate two random numbers between 1 and 10\n        num1 = random.randint(1, 10)\n        num2 = random.randint(1, 10)\n\n        # Choose a random operator\n        op = random.choice(list(operators.keys()))\n\n        # Calculate the correct answer\n        correct_answer = operators[op](num1, num2)\n\n        # Ask the user for their answer\n        user_answer = float(input(f\"What is {num1} {op} {num2}? \"))\n\n        # Check if the user's answer is correct\n        if abs(user_answer - correct_answer) < 0.01:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer was {correct_answer:.2f}\\n\")\n\n    # Print the user's final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {num_questions}\")\n\ndef main():\n    num_questions = int(input(\"How many questions would you like to answer? \"))\n    math_quiz(num_questions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program and enter the number of questions you'd like to answer when prompted.\n2. Answer each math question to the best of your ability.\n3. After completing all the questions, your final score will be displayed.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple method to check for correct answers, allowing for a small margin of error (0.01) to account for floating-point precision issues.",
