  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print 'Buzz'. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\ndef fizzbuzz(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print('FizzBuzz')\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print('Fizz')\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print('Buzz')\n        else:\n            print(i + 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    fizzbuzz(100)\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
