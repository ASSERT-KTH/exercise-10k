  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specifications, here is the code that matches the description:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int num = 0;\n\n        if (num > 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Positive number\");\n        }\n        else if (num < 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Negative number\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Zero\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code meets all the requirements specified in the breakdown:\n\n1. It includes the `System` namespace to use the `Console.WriteLine` method.\n2. It defines a `Program` class with a `Main` method, which serves as the entry point for the program.\n3. It declares an integer variable `num` and initializes it with the value `0`.\n4. It uses an `if-else` statement to check the value of `num`:\n\t* If `num` is greater than `0`, it prints \"Positive number\".\n\t* If `num` is less than `0`, it prints \"Negative number\".\n\t* If `num` is neither greater than nor less than `0` (i.e., it's equal to `0`), it prints \"Zero\".\n\nNote that, as mentioned in the breakdown, the program will always print \"Zero\" because `num` is initialized with the value `0`. If you want to test the program with different values, you can modify the initialization of `num` or add more code to input a value from the user.",
