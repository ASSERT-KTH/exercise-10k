  "answer": "**Text Analysis Program**\n=========================\n\nThis program analyzes a piece of text and calculates statistics such as word count, sentence count, and average word length.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_word_count(text):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the word count of the text.\"\"\"\n    words = text.split()\n    return len(words)\n\ndef calculate_sentence_count(text):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sentence count of the text.\"\"\"\n    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', text)\n    # Remove empty strings from the list\n    sentences = [sentence for sentence in sentences if sentence.strip()]\n    return len(sentences)\n\ndef calculate_average_word_length(text):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the average word length of the text.\"\"\"\n    words = text.split()\n    total_length = sum(len(word) for word in words)\n    return total_length / len(words)\n\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the text and returns statistics.\"\"\"\n    word_count = calculate_word_count(text)\n    sentence_count = calculate_sentence_count(text)\n    average_word_length = calculate_average_word_length(text)\n    return {\n        \"word_count\": word_count,\n        \"sentence_count\": sentence_count,\n        \"average_word_length\": average_word_length\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    text = input(\"Enter a piece of text: \")\n    statistics = analyze_text(text)\n    print(\"Text Statistics:\")\n    print(f\"Word Count: {statistics['word_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Sentence Count: {statistics['sentence_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Average Word Length: {statistics['average_word_length']:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\nThis program uses the following functions to analyze the text:\n\n*   `calculate_word_count`: Splits the text into words and returns the count.\n*   `calculate_sentence_count`: Splits the text into sentences using regular expressions and returns the count.\n*   `calculate_average_word_length`: Calculates the total length of all words and divides it by the word count to get the average word length.\n*   `analyze_text`: Calls the above functions and returns a dictionary containing the statistics.\n*   `main`: Takes user input, calls `analyze_text`, and prints the statistics.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Enter a piece of text when prompted.\n3.  The program will display the word count, sentence count, and average word length of the text.\n\n**Note**: This program considers punctuation as part of a word. If you want to remove punctuation, you can use the `re` module to replace punctuation with spaces before splitting the text into words.",
