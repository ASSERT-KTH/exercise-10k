  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points**\n==============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space given their coordinates. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): Coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (list): Coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of coordinates\")\n\n    squared_diffs = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n    return math.sqrt(sum(squared_diffs))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1_2d = [1, 2]\n    point2_2d = [4, 6]\n    print(\"Distance between 2D points:\", calculate_distance(point1_2d, point2_2d))\n\n    point1_3d = [1, 2, 3]\n    point2_3d = [4, 5, 6]\n    print(\"Distance between 3D points:\", calculate_distance(point1_3d, point2_3d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_distance` function takes two points as input, each represented as a list of coordinates.\n*   It checks if both points have the same number of coordinates and raises a `ValueError` if they don't.\n*   It calculates the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points using a list comprehension.\n*   It returns the square root of the sum of these squared differences, which represents the Euclidean distance between the two points.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `calculate_distance` with example 2D and 3D points.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space: `calculate_distance([1, 2], [4, 6])`\n*   Calculate the distance between two points in a 3D space: `calculate_distance([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`",
