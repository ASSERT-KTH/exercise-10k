  "prompt": "Write a program that declares and initializes date and time variables, then prints their values.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <ctime>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    tm date = {};\n    time_t date_time;\n    time(&date_time);\n    localtime_r(&date_time, &date);\n\n    cout << date.tm_year << endl;\n    cout << date.tm_mon << endl;\n    cout << date.tm_mday << endl;\n    cout << date.tm_hour << endl;\n    cout << date.tm_min << endl;\n    cout << date.tm_sec << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that I've used `localtime_r` instead of `localtime` as mentioned in the note, since `localtime` is not thread-safe and can cause issues with multi-threaded programs.",
