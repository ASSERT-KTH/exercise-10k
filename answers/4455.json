  "answer": "**Word Count Program**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a user input text, splits it into words, and counts the occurrences of each word. The word counts are then printed out.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_words(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of each word in a given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the text to lowercase and remove punctuation\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each word\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n\n    return word_counts\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the user input text\n    text = input(\"Please enter a text: \")\n\n    # Count the word occurrences\n    word_counts = count_words(text)\n\n    # Print out the word counts\n    print(\"Word Counts:\")\n    for word, count in word_counts.most_common():\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_words` function takes a text as input and converts it to lowercase to ensure the word count is case-insensitive.\n2. It removes punctuation from the text using a regular expression.\n3. The text is split into words using the `split` method.\n4. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each word.\n5. The `main` function gets the user input text, calls the `count_words` function, and prints out the word counts.\n6. The word counts are printed out in descending order of frequency using the `most_common` method.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nPlease enter a text: This is a test. This test is only a test.\nWord Counts:\ntest: 3\nthis: 2\nis: 2\na: 2\nonly: 1\n```",
