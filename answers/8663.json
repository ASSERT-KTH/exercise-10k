  "answer": "**Age Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their current age and prints out their age in 10 years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_age():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's current age\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your current age: \"))\n            if age < 0:\n                print(\"Age cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            else:\n                return age\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef calculate_future_age(current_age):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the user's age in 10 years\"\"\"\n    return current_age + 10\n\ndef main():\n    current_age = get_user_age()\n    future_age = calculate_future_age(current_age)\n    print(f\"In 10 years, you will be {future_age} years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your current age when prompted.\n3. The program will print out your age in 10 years.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid whole number for their age.\n* The `get_user_age` function handles invalid input and asks the user to try again.\n* The `calculate_future_age` function simply adds 10 to the user's current age.\n* The `main` function coordinates the program's flow and prints out the result.",
