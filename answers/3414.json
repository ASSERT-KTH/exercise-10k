  "answer": "**Dictionary Filter Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program filters a given dictionary based on a specific condition. It uses a function `filter_dict` that takes in a dictionary and a condition function as arguments. The condition function should return `True` or `False` based on the condition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_dict(input_dict, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a dictionary based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes in a key-value pair and returns True or False.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The filtered dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if condition(key, value)}\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a sample dictionary\n    sample_dict = {\n        \"a\": 1,\n        \"b\": 2,\n        \"c\": 3,\n        \"d\": 4,\n        \"e\": 5\n    }\n\n    # Define a condition function\n    def is_even(key, value):\n        return value % 2 == 0\n\n    # Filter the dictionary\n    filtered_dict = filter_dict(sample_dict, is_even)\n\n    # Print the filtered dictionary\n    print(\"Original Dictionary:\")\n    print(sample_dict)\n    print(\"Filtered Dictionary:\")\n    print(filtered_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `filter_dict` function takes in a dictionary `input_dict` and a condition function `condition`.\n2. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs that satisfy the condition.\n3. The condition function `condition` is called with each key-value pair as arguments. If it returns `True`, the key-value pair is included in the filtered dictionary.\n4. The filtered dictionary is returned by the `filter_dict` function.\n5. In the example usage, a sample dictionary `sample_dict` is defined, and a condition function `is_even` is defined to filter out odd values.\n6. The `filter_dict` function is called with the sample dictionary and the condition function, and the filtered dictionary is printed.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal Dictionary:\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}\nFiltered Dictionary:\n{'b': 2, 'd': 4}\n```",
