  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is prime: {is_prime(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it immediately returns `False`, as prime numbers are greater than 1.\n3. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`, as `n` is not prime.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\n### Note\n\n* This function uses a optimized approach by only checking divisors up to the square root of `n`, reducing the number of iterations.\n* The example usage in the `main()` function demonstrates how to use the `is_prime()` function with a list of numbers.",
