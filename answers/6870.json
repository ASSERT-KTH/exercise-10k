  "prompt": "Write a program that checks the data type of a given variable and prints out whether it is an integer, float, string, or boolean. The program should handle all four data types and provide a clear output message for each.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in Python based on your specifications:\n\n```python\nvar = 10\n# var = 2.2\n# var = \"Hello, world!\"\n# var = True\n\nif type(var) == int:\n    print(\"Variable is an integer\")\nelif type(var) == float:\n    print(\"Variable is a float\")\nelif type(var) == str:\n    print(\"Variable is a string\")\nelif type(var) == bool:\n    print(\"Variable is a boolean\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `var` variable is assigned an integer value. The `if-elif` chain checks the data type of `var` using the `type()` function and prints the corresponding message. Note that the `type()` function returns the type of the variable, which is then compared to the desired type using the `==` operator. The `elif` statements are used to check for other possible types.\n\nYou can uncomment the other assignment lines to test the code with different data types.",
