  "answer": "**Credit Card Number Validator**\n================================\n\nThis program uses the Luhn algorithm to validate a credit card number. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula that is widely used to validate credit card numbers.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(digit) for digit in card_number]\n    \n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n    \n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n    \n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    return sum(card_number) % 10 == 0\n\ndef main():\n    card_number = input(\"Enter a credit card number: \")\n    \n    # Remove any non-digit characters from the card number\n    card_number = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, card_number))\n    \n    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 19:\n        print(\"Invalid card number. Card number must be between 13 and 19 digits.\")\n    elif not validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n        print(\"Invalid card number.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Valid card number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `validate_credit_card_number` function takes a credit card number as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is valid.\n2. The function first converts the card number to a list of integers and reverses the list.\n3. It then doubles every second digit in the list. If a digit is greater than 9 after doubling, it subtracts 9 from the digit.\n4. Finally, it checks if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10. If it is, the card number is valid.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a credit card number, removes any non-digit characters from the input, and checks if the length of the card number is between 13 and 19 digits.\n6. If the length is valid, it calls the `validate_credit_card_number` function to check if the card number is valid. If the card number is valid, it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter a credit card number when prompted. The program will then print a message indicating whether the card number is valid or not.\n\n```\nEnter a credit card number: 4111111111111111\nValid card number.\n```",
