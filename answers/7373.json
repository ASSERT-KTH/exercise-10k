  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The operations to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not supported.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else float('inf')\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is supported\n    if operation not in operations:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    try:\n        result = operations[operation](num1, num2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): \")\n\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the specified arithmetic operation, and returns the result.\n*   It uses a dictionary to map operation names to their corresponding lambda functions, making it easy to add or remove supported operations.\n*   The function includes error handling for unsupported operations and division by zero, raising informative error messages in these cases.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate` function by taking user input for the numbers and operation, performing the calculation, and displaying the result or any error that occurs.",
