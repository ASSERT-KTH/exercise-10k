  "answer": "**Simple Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nThis program implements a simple number guessing game using if/else statements. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help the player guess the correct number.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Get the player's guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        if user_guess.isdigit():\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. The player guesses the correct number on the first attempt:\n\t* Input: `50`\n\t* Output: `Congratulations! You found the number in 1 attempts.`\n2. The player guesses a number that is too low:\n\t* Input: `25`\n\t* Output: `Too low. Try again!`\n3. The player guesses a number that is too high:\n\t* Input: `75`\n\t* Output: `Too high. Try again!`\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint()` function.\n2. The player is prompted to guess the number.\n3. The program checks if the input is a valid integer using the `isdigit()` method. If not, it prompts the player to enter a whole number.\n4. The program checks if the guess is correct. If it is, it congratulates the player and ends the game.\n5. If the guess is not correct, the program provides a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low\", to help the player guess the correct number.\n6. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.",
