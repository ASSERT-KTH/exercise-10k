  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store the grades of students in a class. The dictionary should have the student's name as the key and a list of their grades as the value. The program should allow the user to add a student, add a grade to a student's list of grades, and calculate the average grade for a student.",

The dictionary has the student's name as the key and a list of their grades as the value.\n\nThe program has three main functions:\n\n1.  `add_student(name)`: Adds a student to the dictionary with an empty list for grades.\n2.  `add_grade(name, grade)`: Adds a grade to a student's list of grades.\n3.  `calculate_average(name)`: Calculates the average grade for a student.\n\nThe `main()` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program. The user can add a student, add a grade to a student, calculate the average grade for a student, or quit the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Add a student: Choose option 1, enter the student's name (e.g., \"John Doe\").\n*   Add a grade to a student: Choose option 2, enter the student's name (e.g., \"John Doe\") and the grade (e.g., 85.0).\n*   Calculate the average grade for a student: Choose option 3, enter the student's name (e.g., \"John Doe\").\n\nNote: The program uses a simple text-based interface. You can modify it to use a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface if needed.",
