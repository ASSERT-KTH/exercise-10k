  "answer": "**Student Grades Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a dictionary to store student grades. It allows users to input a student's name and a grade, and then stores this information in the dictionary. The program also has an option to calculate the average grade for a given student.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass StudentGrades:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.grades = {}\n\n    def add_grade(self):\n        \"\"\"Add a grade for a student\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n        grade = float(input(\"Enter grade: \"))\n\n        if name in self.grades:\n            self.grades[name].append(grade)\n        else:\n            self.grades[name] = [grade]\n\n        print(f\"Grade added for {name}\")\n\n    def calculate_average(self):\n        \"\"\"Calculate the average grade for a student\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter student's name: \")\n\n        if name in self.grades:\n            average = sum(self.grades[name]) / len(self.grades[name])\n            print(f\"The average grade for {name} is {average:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No grades found for {name}\")\n\n    def display_menu(self):\n        \"\"\"Display the main menu\"\"\"\n        while True:\n            print(\"\\nStudent Grades Program\")\n            print(\"1. Add a grade\")\n            print(\"2. Calculate average grade\")\n            print(\"3. Quit\")\n\n            choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n            if choice == \"1\":\n                self.add_grade()\n            elif choice == \"2\":\n                self.calculate_average()\n            elif choice == \"3\":\n                print(\"Goodbye!\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    grades = StudentGrades()\n    grades.display_menu()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose option 1 to add a grade. Enter a student's name and a grade.\n3. Choose option 1 again to add another grade for the same student or a different student.\n4. Choose option 2 to calculate the average grade for a student. Enter the student's name.\n5. Choose option 3 to quit the program.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `StudentGrades` class to encapsulate the data and methods.\n* The `add_grade` method prompts the user for a student's name and a grade, and then stores this information in the dictionary.\n* The `calculate_average` method prompts the user for a student's name, and then calculates the average grade for that student.\n* The `display_menu` method displays the main menu and handles user input.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly display the menu and handle user input until the user chooses to quit.",
