  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python to demonstrate the lifetime of a variable:\n\n```python\nclass Variable:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        print(f\"Variable {self.name} created\")\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        print(f\"Variable {self.name} destroyed\")\n\n\ndef create_variable(name):\n    var = Variable(name)\n    print(f\"Variable {var.name} is in scope\")\n    return var\n\n\ndef main():\n    var1 = create_variable(\"var1\")\n    print(\"Exiting create_variable function\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCreating var2\")\n    var2 = Variable(\"var2\")\n    print(\"Variable var2 is in scope\")\n\n    # delete var2\n    del var2\n    print(\"Variable var2 deleted\")\n\n    # delete var1\n    del var1\n    print(\"Variable var1 deleted\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\nIn this program, we have a `Variable` class that represents a variable. The `__init__` method is called when an instance of the class is created, and the `__del__` method is called when an instance of the class is about to be destroyed.\n\nIn the `main` function, we create two variables `var1` and `var2`. For `var1`, we create it inside the `create_variable` function and then return it. This means that even though `var1` is created in the `create_variable` function, it is still accessible in the `main` function because we returned it.\n\nFor `var2`, we create it directly in the `main` function. We then delete `var2` using the `del` statement, which calls the `__del__` method and destroys the variable.\n\nFinally, we delete `var1` using the `del` statement, which calls the `__del__` method and destroys the variable.\n\nWhen you run this program, you should see the following output:\n\n```\nVariable var1 created\nVariable var1 is in scope\nExiting create_variable function\n\nCreating var2\nVariable var2 created\nVariable var2 is in scope\nVariable var2 destroyed\nVariable var2 deleted\nVariable var1 destroyed\nVariable var1 deleted\n```\n\nThis output shows the lifetime of the two variables. `var1` is created when we call `create_variable`, and it is destroyed when we delete it in the `main` function. `var2` is created when we call `Variable` directly, and it is destroyed when we delete it in the `main` function.",
