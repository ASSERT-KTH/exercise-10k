  "answer": "**Luhn Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nThe Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. Here's a Python function that implements the Luhn algorithm to check if a given credit card number is valid:\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(digit) for digit in card_number.replace(\" \", \"\")]\n\n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n\n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n\n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    return sum(card_number) % 10 == 0\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    card_number = \"4532015112830366\"\n    if validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n        print(f\"The credit card number {card_number} is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The credit card number {card_number} is not valid.\")\n```\n\n**How the Luhn Algorithm Works**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.  **Reverse the card number**: Reverse the order of the digits in the card number.\n2.  **Double every second digit**: Double every second digit in the reversed card number.\n3.  **Subtract 9 from numbers over 9**: If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from it.\n4.  **Calculate the sum**: Add up all the digits in the modified card number.\n5.  **Check for validity**: If the sum is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it's not.\n\n**Notes**\n----------\n\n*   The Luhn algorithm does not verify the actual existence of a credit card or its associated account; it only checks the validity of the card number format.\n*   This implementation assumes that the input card number is a string of digits, possibly with spaces in between. If the input may contain other characters, you should add error handling to remove or handle them accordingly.",
