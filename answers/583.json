  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # Check if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    # If the number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it is prime\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root (inclusive).\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n6. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, and the `is_prime` function is called with this number.\n7. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `25` - Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23` - Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `37` - Output: `37 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `48` - Output: `48 is not a prime number.`",
