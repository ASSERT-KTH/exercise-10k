  "prompt": "Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score and returns their corresponding grade. The grades are calculated as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). The function should also handle cases where the input score is not a number or is not within the range of 0 to 100.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that maps student scores to their corresponding grades, handling various input scenarios. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input score is not a number\n    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)):\n        # If it's not a number, we raise a TypeError with a descriptive message\n        raise TypeError(\"Input score must be a number.\")\n\n    # Next, we check if the input score is not within the range of 0 to 100\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        # If it's not within the range, we raise a ValueError with a descriptive message\n        raise ValueError(\"Input score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n\n    # Now, we can start calculating the grade\n    # We use an if-elif-else statement to check the score and return the corresponding grade\n    # We start with the highest grade and go down to the lowest\n    if score >= 90: \n        # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80: \n        # If the score is 80 or above but less than 90, the grade is B\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70: \n        # If the score is 70 or above but less than 80, the grade is C\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60: \n        # If the score is 60 or above but less than 70, the grade is D\n        return 'D'\n    else: \n        # If the score is less than 60, the grade is F\n        return 'F'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_grade` first checks if the input `score` is a number and within the valid range (0-100), raising a `TypeError` or `ValueError` accordingly if these conditions are not met.\n* It then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on the `score`, starting from the highest grade 'A' and moving down to the lowest grade 'F'.\n* Each condition in the if-elif-else chain checks if the `score` is greater than or equal to a specific threshold, returning the corresponding grade if true.\n* If none of the above conditions are met, it means the `score` is below 60, and the function returns 'F' as the grade.",
