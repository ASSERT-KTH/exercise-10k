  "prompt": "Create a function to find the first occurrence of a substring within a given string. The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that finds the first occurrence of a substring within a given string and provide a clear explanation of the code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(main_string, sub_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the first occurrence of a substring within a given string.\n    \n    Args:\n        main_string (str): The string in which we are searching for the substring.\n        sub_string (str): The substring that we are searching for.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the main string and the substring are not None\n    if main_string is None or sub_string is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Neither the main string nor the substring can be None\")\n\n    # We use Python's built-in str.find() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring\n    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1\n    # This method is case-sensitive and considers 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings\n    index = main_string.find(sub_string)\n\n    # We return the index, which is either the position of the substring or -1\n    return index\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_substring` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and first checks if either of them is `None`. If so, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.\n* It uses Python's built-in `str.find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n* This method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings.\n* The function returns the index found by `str.find()`, which is either the position of `sub_string` or `-1` if it's not found.",
