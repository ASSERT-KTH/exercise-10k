  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and allows the user to guess it. The program uses if/else statements to check if the guess is correct, and provides feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\" Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `random_number_guessing_game` function. The program will generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it. The user can enter their guess, and the program will provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. If the user wants to quit, they can type \"quit\" to exit the program.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program initializes the number of attempts to 0.\n3. The program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n4. If the user enters \"quit\", the program reveals the correct answer and exits.\n5. The program tries to convert the user's guess to an integer. If the input is invalid (e.g. a string), the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration.\n6. The program increments the number of attempts.\n7. The program checks if the guess is correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and exits.\n8. If the guess is too low or too high, the program provides feedback to the user and continues to the next iteration.",
