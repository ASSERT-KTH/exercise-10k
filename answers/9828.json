  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The function to calculate the area should take the length and width as parameters, and the function to calculate the perimeter should take the length and width as parameters. The program should then print out the calculated area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint area(int l, int w) {\n    return l * w;\n}\n\nint perimeter(int l, int w) {\n    return 2 * (l + w);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int length = 5;\n    int width = 3;\n    int a = area(length, width);\n    int p = perimeter(length, width);\n    cout << \"Area: \" << a << endl;\n    cout << \"Perimeter: \" << p << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions, `area` and `perimeter`, that take two `int` parameters and return the calculated area and perimeter, respectively. In the `main` function, it sets the `length` and `width` variables to 5 and 3, calls the `area` and `perimeter` functions with these variables as arguments, stores the results in `a` and `p`, and then prints out the values of `a` and `p` using `cout`.",
