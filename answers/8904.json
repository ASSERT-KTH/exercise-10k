  "answer": "**Binary Search Implementation**\n====================================\n\nHere is a Python implementation of binary search on a sorted list:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the target element in a sorted list using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n    - sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n    - target: The target element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n    - The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  Initialize `low` to 0 (the first index of the list) and `high` to the last index of the list.\n2.  Loop until `low` is greater than `high`.\n3.  Calculate the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n4.  Compare the middle element `sorted_list[mid]` to the target element `target`.\n    *   If they are equal, return the midpoint index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1`.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1`.\n5.  If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target is not in the list.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because with each iteration, the search space is halved, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.",
