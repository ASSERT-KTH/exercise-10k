  "prompt": "Create a function that takes the length and width of a rectangle as arguments and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input values are valid. \n    # We assume that the length and width should be non-negative numbers.\n    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Length and width must be numbers.\")\n    if length < 0 or width < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width cannot be negative.\")\n\n    # Now, we can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width.\n    # This is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.\n    area = length * width\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated area.\n    return area\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_rectangle_area` takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and first checks if they are valid non-negative numbers. It raises a `TypeError` if they are not numbers and a `ValueError` if they are negative.\n* The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the `length` and `width` using the formula `area = length * width`.\n* The function then returns the calculated `area`.\n* The function includes docstrings that provide documentation for the function, including its purpose, arguments, and return value.",
