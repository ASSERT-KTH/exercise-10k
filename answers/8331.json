  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, the program should display an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n# Define a function to perform addition\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Define a function to perform subtraction\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\n# Define a function to perform multiplication\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\n# Define a function to perform division\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return 'Error: Division by zero'\n    else:\n        return x / y\n\n# Define a function to perform the chosen operation\ndef calculate(x, y, operation):\n    if operation == 1:\n        return add(x, y)\n    elif operation == 2:\n        return subtract(x, y)\n    elif operation == 3:\n        return multiply(x, y)\n    elif operation == 4:\n        return divide(x, y)\n    else:\n        return 'Error: Invalid operation'\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Arithmetic Operations:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = int(input(\"Enter the operation number: \"))\n\n    # Call the calculate function\n    result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic operations as functions, then defines a `calculate` function that takes two numbers and an operation number as input and performs the corresponding operation. The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result. Finally, the code calls the `main` function when the script is run.",
