  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and uses if/else statements to determine the smallest number.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your request:\n```python\ndef smallest_number(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest number among three input numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n    c (int): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The smallest number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a <= b and a <= c:\n        return a\n    elif b <= a and b <= c:\n        return b\n    else:\n        return c\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    smallest = smallest_number(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The smallest number is: {smallest}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### How It Works:\n1. The `smallest_number` function takes three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.\n2. It uses if/else statements to compare these numbers.\n3. If `a` is less than or equal to both `b` and `c`, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it checks if `b` is the smallest and returns it. If neither `a` nor `b` is the smallest, it returns `c`.\n4. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to input three numbers.\n5. It calls the `smallest_number` function with these inputs and prints the result.\n\n### Notes:\n* This program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers. If you only want to work with integers, you can use `int` instead.\n* The program assumes that the user will input valid numbers. In a real-world application, you would want to add error checking to handle invalid inputs.",
