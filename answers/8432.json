  "answer": "**Conditional Statement Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses conditional statements to control the flow of a function. The program simulates a simple bank account system, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a bank account with a given balance.\n\n        Args:\n            balance (float, optional): Initial balance. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit a given amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw a given amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            if amount <= self.balance:\n                self.balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000 balance\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to deposit $500.\n2. Select option 2 to withdraw $200.\n3. Select option 3 to check the current balance.\n4. Select option 4 to exit the program.\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if-else` and `if-elif-else`) to control the flow of the `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `check_balance` methods, as well as the `main` function.",
