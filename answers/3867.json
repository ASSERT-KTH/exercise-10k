  "prompt": "Given a dictionary with names of planets as keys and their diameters as values, write a program to retrieve and print the diameter of a specific planet.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that retrieves and prints the diameter of a specific planet from a dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef get_planet_diameter(planets, planet_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the diameter of a specific planet from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        planets (dict): A dictionary with planet names as keys and their diameters as values.\n        planet_name (str): The name of the planet to retrieve the diameter for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The diameter of the specified planet, or None if the planet is not found.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input dictionary or planet name is not of the correct type.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(planets, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n    if not isinstance(planet_name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Planet name must be a string\")\n\n    # Check if the planet exists in the dictionary\n    if planet_name in planets:\n        # Return the diameter of the planet\n        return planets[planet_name]\n    else:\n        # Return None if the planet is not found\n        return None\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a dictionary with planet names as keys and their diameters as values\n    planets = {\n        \"Mercury\": 4879.4,\n        \"Venus\": 12103.6,\n        \"Earth\": 12756.2,\n        \"Mars\": 6794,\n        \"Jupiter\": 142984,\n        \"Saturn\": 116460,\n        \"Uranus\": 50724,\n        \"Neptune\": 49528\n    }\n\n    # Specify the planet to retrieve the diameter for\n    planet_name = \"Earth\"\n\n    # Retrieve and print the diameter of the planet\n    diameter = get_planet_diameter(planets, planet_name)\n\n    if diameter is not None:\n        print(f\"The diameter of {planet_name} is {diameter} kilometers.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{planet_name} not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `get_planet_diameter` that takes a dictionary `planets` and a `planet_name` as input.\n*   Inside the function, we check if the `planet_name` exists as a key in the `planets` dictionary. If it does, we return the corresponding diameter value.\n*   If the `planet_name` is not found in the dictionary, we return `None`.\n*   In the `main` function, we create a dictionary `planets` with planet names as keys and their diameters as values.\n*   We specify the `planet_name` for which we want to retrieve the diameter and call the `get_planet_diameter` function.\n*   Finally, we print the diameter of the planet if it is found in the dictionary; otherwise, we print a message indicating that the planet is not found.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Retrieve the diameter of Earth: `get_planet_diameter(planets, \"Earth\")`\n*   Retrieve the diameter of a non-existent planet: `get_planet_diameter(planets, \"Pluto\")`\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Ensure that the input dictionary and planet name are of the correct type (dictionary and string, respectively).\n*   Handle cases where the planet is not found in the dictionary by returning `None` or raising an exception.\n*   Use meaningful variable names and follow standard naming conventions for better code readability.",
