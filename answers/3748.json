  "answer": "Here's a simple program in Python to calculate the average of all numbers in a list using a basic algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of all numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of all numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0  # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    count = 0  # Initialize the count of numbers to 0\n\n    # Iterate through the list\n    for num in num_list:\n        total += num  # Add each number to the total\n        count += 1  # Increment the count\n\n    # Check if the list is not empty\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        average = total / count  # Calculate the average\n        return average\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. Initialize two variables: `total` to store the sum of all numbers, and `count` to store the count of numbers.\n2. Iterate through the list using a for loop, adding each number to `total` and incrementing `count`.\n3. After iterating through the list, check if the list is not empty. If it is empty, return 0.\n4. If the list is not empty, calculate the average by dividing `total` by `count`.\n5. Return the calculated average.\n\n**Note:** This program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list may contain non-numeric values, additional error checking should be added to handle such cases.",
