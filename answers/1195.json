  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that stores student grades in a dictionary and calculates the average grade:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for a given dictionary of student grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): Dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: Dictionary with student names as keys and average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grades = {}\n    for student, grade_list in grades.items():\n        average_grade = sum(grade_list) / len(grade_list)\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n    return average_grades\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    student_grades = {\n        \"John\": [90, 85, 95],\n        \"Alice\": [92, 88, 91],\n        \"Bob\": [78, 82, 85]\n    }\n\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grade(student_grades)\n\n    print(\"Student Grades:\")\n    for student, grade_list in student_grades.items():\n        print(f\"{student}: {grade_list}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAverage Grades:\")\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        print(f\"{student}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Dictionary Structure**: The program uses a dictionary (`student_grades`) to store student grades, where each key is a student's name, and the corresponding value is a list of grades.\n2.  **Average Grade Calculation**: The `calculate_average_grade` function takes the `student_grades` dictionary as input and calculates the average grade for each student by summing up their grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n3.  **Main Function**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_grade` function. It defines an example `student_grades` dictionary, calculates the average grades using the `calculate_average_grade` function, and prints both the original grades and the calculated average grades.\n\n### Output:\n\nWhen you run this program, it will display the original grades for each student and their corresponding average grades, rounded to two decimal places. The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nStudent Grades:\nJohn: [90, 85, 95]\nAlice: [92, 88, 91]\nBob: [78, 82, 85]\n\nAverage Grades:\nJohn: 90.00\nAlice: 90.33\nBob: 81.67\n```",
