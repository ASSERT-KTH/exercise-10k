  "answer": "**Merging Two Lists without Duplicates**\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that merges two lists and returns a new list with unique elements.\n\n```python\ndef merge_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two lists and return a new list with unique elements.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to merge.\n        list2 (list): The second list to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all unique elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Combine both lists into a set to remove duplicates\n    merged_set = set(list1 + list2)\n    \n    # Convert the set back to a list and return it\n    return list(merged_set)\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nmerged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Merged List:\", merged_list)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Define a function `merge_lists` that takes two lists as input.\n2. Combine both lists into a single list using the `+` operator.\n3. Convert the combined list to a set using the `set()` function. This automatically removes any duplicate elements.\n4. Convert the set back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. Return the merged list.\n\n**Note:** This program does not preserve the original order of elements. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef merge_lists_ordered(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two lists and return a new list with unique elements, preserving order.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to merge.\n        list2 (list): The second list to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all unique elements from both input lists, in the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    merged_list = []\n    \n    for element in list1 + list2:\n        if element not in seen:\n            merged_list.append(element)\n            seen.add(element)\n    \n    return merged_list\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nmerged_list = merge_lists_ordered(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Merged List (Ordered):\", merged_list)\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a set to keep track of seen elements and appends each element to the merged list only if it has not been seen before. This preserves the original order of elements.",
