  "answer": "### Creating a Playlist Function\n#### Description\nThis function takes in a list of songs, where each song is a dictionary containing the song's title and artist. It returns a dictionary representing the playlist, with a unique playlist name and the list of songs.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nclass Song:\n    def __init__(self, title, artist):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Song object.\n\n        Args:\n        title (str): The title of the song.\n        artist (str): The artist of the song.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.title = title\n        self.artist = artist\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a string representation of the Song object.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"{self.title} by {self.artist}\"\n\n\nclass Playlist:\n    def __init__(self, name, songs=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Playlist object.\n\n        Args:\n        name (str): The name of the playlist.\n        songs (list, optional): A list of Song objects.

We define two classes: `Song` and `Playlist`. The `Song` class represents a song with a title and artist.\n2.  The `Playlist` class represents a playlist with a name and a list of songs. It includes methods to add songs to the playlist.\n3.  The `create_playlist` function takes in a playlist name and a list of songs, creates a new `Playlist` object, and adds the songs to it.\n4.  In the example usage, we create a list of songs, create a playlist using the `create_playlist` function, and print the resulting playlist.",
