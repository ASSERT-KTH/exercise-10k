  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a password until they enter a valid one. A valid password is defined as one that is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following rules:\n    - At least 8 characters long\n    - Contains at least one uppercase letter\n    - Contains at least one lowercase letter\n    - Contains at least one digit\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n        if validate_password(password):\n            print(\"Valid password entered!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid password. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `validate_password` function checks if a password is valid based on the defined rules.\n2. The `main` function uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a password.\n3. If the password is valid, it prints a success message and breaks out of the loop.\n4. If the password is invalid, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a valid password (e.g. \"Password123\") to see the success message.\n* Run the program and enter an invalid password (e.g. \"password\") to see the error message and be prompted to try again.",
