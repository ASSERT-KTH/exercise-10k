  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings. The program should take a list of strings as input and output the longest common prefix.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef longestCommonPrefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    strs = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\n    print(longestCommonPrefix(strs))\n```\nThis code defines the `longestCommonPrefix` function, which takes a list of strings `strs` as input and returns the longest common prefix. It first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, returns an empty string. Then, it finds the shortest string in the list using the `min` function with a `key` function that returns the length of each string.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the shortest string, and for each character, it checks if the same character appears at the same position in all other strings in the list. If it finds a mismatch, it returns the prefix of the shortest string up to the current position. If it doesn't find any mismatches, it returns the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\nThe code also includes a `main` section that tests the function with a list of strings `[\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]`. The output is printed to the console.",
