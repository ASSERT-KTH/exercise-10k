  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and an element as input and returns the indices of all occurrences of the element.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses list comprehension to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_indices(array, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the indices of all occurrences of the element in the array.\n    \n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        element: The element to find.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of indices where the element is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i for i, x in enumerate(array) if x == element]\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\nelement = 2\nprint(find_indices(array, element))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n- It uses `enumerate(array)` to iterate over the array with both index and value.\n- It checks each value `x` to see if it matches the `element`.\n- If `x` matches the `element`, its index `i` is added to the output list.\n- The function returns the list of indices.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it potentially checks every element in the array. It uses O(n) space as well, because in the worst case (when all elements match the target), it needs to store n indices.",
