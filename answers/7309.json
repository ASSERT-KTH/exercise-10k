  "answer": "**Substring Occurrence Counter Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\nThis function takes two arguments, a string and a substring, and returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_substring_occurrences(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The main string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the substring.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(substring)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, world! Hello again!\"\n    substring = \"Hello\"\n    occurrences = count_substring_occurrences(string, substring)\n    print(f\"The substring '{substring}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.\n\n### Notes\n* This function is case-sensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" would be considered different substrings.\n* This function does not handle overlapping occurrences, so if the substring is \"aa\" and the string is \"aaa\", the function would only return 1, not 2. If you need to count overlapping occurrences, you would need a more complex function.",
