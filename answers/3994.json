  "answer": "**Ransom Note Checker Program**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a ransom note can be constructed from a given magazine by comparing the words in the ransom note to the words available in the magazine.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef can_construct_ransom_note(magazine, ransom_note):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a ransom note can be constructed from a given magazine.\n\n    Args:\n        magazine (str): The text from which words can be cut.\n        ransom_note (str): The text that needs to be constructed.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the ransom note can be constructed, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the magazine and ransom note into words\n    magazine_words = magazine.split()\n    ransom_note_words = ransom_note.split()\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each word in the magazine and ransom note\n    magazine_word_counts = Counter(magazine_words)\n    ransom_note_word_counts = Counter(ransom_note_words)\n\n    # Check if each word in the ransom note can be found in the magazine\n    for word, count in ransom_note_word_counts.items():\n        if word not in magazine_word_counts or count > magazine_word_counts[word]:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    magazine = \"give me one grand today night\"\n    ransom_note = \"give one grand today\"\n    print(can_construct_ransom_note(magazine, ransom_note))  # Output: True\n\n    magazine = \"two times two is four\"\n    ransom_note = \"two times two is four five\"\n    print(can_construct_ransom_note(magazine, ransom_note))  # Output: False\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each word in the magazine and ransom note.\n2. It then checks if each word in the ransom note can be found in the magazine and if the count of the word in the ransom note is less than or equal to the count of the word in the magazine.\n3. If any word in the ransom note cannot be found in the magazine or if the count of the word in the ransom note is greater than the count of the word in the magazine, the program returns `False`.\n4. If all words in the ransom note can be found in the magazine and the counts are sufficient, the program returns `True`.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n is the number of words in the magazine and m is the number of words in the ransom note. This is because the program needs to iterate over each word in both the magazine and the ransom note to count the occurrences and compare them.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n is the number of words in the magazine and m is the number of words in the ransom note. This is because the program needs to store the counts of each word in both the magazine and the ransom note.",
