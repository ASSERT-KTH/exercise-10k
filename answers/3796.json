  "answer": "**Minimum Coins Function**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum number of coins.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n    coins (list): A list of available coin denominations.\n    amount (int): The amount for which to make change.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make 0 amount\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # Return the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n# Example usage:\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(min_coins(coins, amount))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize a list `dp` of size `amount + 1` with infinite values, representing the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount.\n2. Set the base case `dp[0] = 0`, as 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount.\n3. Iterate over each coin denomination and update the `dp` list accordingly.\n4. For each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount, update the minimum number of coins needed by taking the minimum of the current value and the value for the amount minus the coin denomination plus 1.\n5. Return the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount. If no combination of coins can make the target amount, return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n* The time complexity of this function is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the target amount and len(coins) is the number of available coin denominations.\n* The space complexity is O(amount), as we need to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount.",
