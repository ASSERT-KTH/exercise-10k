  "prompt": "Given an array of integers and a number k, find the minimum possible maximum difference between any two elements in the array after adding k to each element. The function should take in an array of integers and a number k as input and return the minimum possible maximum difference.",
  "answer": "```python\ndef min_max_diff(arr, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between any two elements in the array after adding k to each element.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A list of integers.\n    k (int): The number to be added to each element in the array.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum possible maximum difference.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # First, we sort the array in ascending order\n    arr.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the minimum and maximum values with the first and last elements of the sorted array\n    # We add k to each element because the problem states that we need to add k to each element\n    min_val = arr[0] + k\n    max_val = arr[-1] + k\n    \n    # The minimum possible maximum difference is the difference between the maximum and minimum values\n    # We use the built-in max and min functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array\n    # However, since we have already sorted the array, we can directly use the first and last elements\n    min_max_diff = max_val - min_val\n    \n    # Return the minimum possible maximum difference\n    return min_max_diff\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 5, 10, 15]\nk = 2\nprint(min_max_diff(arr, k))  # Output: 12\n```",
