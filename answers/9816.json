  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the discount for a customer based on their age. If the customer is 65 or older, they receive a 10% discount. If they are between 18 and 64 (inclusive), they receive a 5% discount. If they are under 18, they receive a 20% discount. The program should take the customer's age and the original price as input and output the price after the discount.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, p;\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter your age: \";\n    std::cin >> a;\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter the original price: \";\n    std::cin >> p;\n\n    if (a >= 65) {\n        p = std::floor(p * 0.9);\n    } else if (a >= 18 && a <= 64) {\n        p = std::floor(p * 0.95);\n    } else {\n        p = std::floor(p * 0.8);\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"The final price after discount is: \" << p << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary headers, defines the `main` function, and uses `int` variables for age and price as specified. The program prompts the user to input their age and the original price, applies a discount based on the age range, and then outputs the final price after discount. The `std::floor` function is used to round the final price to the nearest integer.",
