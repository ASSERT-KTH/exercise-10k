  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program prints out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"Generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\"\"\"\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(sequence) < n:\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Print out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)\n    print(\"The first {} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:\".format(n))\n    print(fib_sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `fibonacci` function generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. It starts with a list containing the first two numbers in the sequence: 0 and 1.\n3. It then enters a loop that continues until the list contains `n` numbers.\n4. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the list to the end of the list.\n5. The `main` function calls `fibonacci` with `n = 10` and prints out the resulting sequence.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `fibonacci.py`) and run it with Python (e.g., `python fibonacci.py`).",
