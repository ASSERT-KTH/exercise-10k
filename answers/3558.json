  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether the two lists are disjoint (i.e., have no elements in common).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef disjoint(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return True if the two lists are disjoint, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n    for x in a:\n        if x in b:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Test the function\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(disjoint(a, b))  # Expected output: True\n\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [3, 4, 5]\nprint(disjoint(a, b))  # Expected output: False\n```\nThis code defines the `disjoint` function, which takes two lists `a` and `b` as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two lists are disjoint. The function uses a simple loop to iterate over each element `x` in list `a`, and checks if `x` is also in list `b` using the `in` operator. If it finds an element that is common to both lists, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over all elements in `a` without finding a common element, it returns `True`.\n\nThe code also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior. The first test case uses two disjoint lists `a` and `b`, and the function correctly returns `True`. The second test case uses two lists that have a common element, and the function correctly returns `False`.",
