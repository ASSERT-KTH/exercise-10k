  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula or pattern. The program uses a simple command-line interface to input the formula and the number of terms to generate.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef sequence_generator(formula, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula.\n\n    Args:\n        formula (str): A string representing the formula to generate the sequence.\n                       The formula should be in the format of a Python expression,\n                       where 'n' represents the term number.\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers representing the generated sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Replace 'n' in the formula with the current term number\n        term = eval(formula.replace('n', str(i)))\n        sequence.append(term)\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Sequence Generator Program\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    # Get the formula from the user\n    formula = input(\"Enter the formula (e.g., 'n**2', '2*n', etc.): \")\n\n    # Get the number of terms from the user\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    # Generate the sequence\n    sequence = sequence_generator(formula, n)\n\n    # Print the generated sequence\n    print(\"Generated Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Enter the formula `((1 + 5**0.5)/2)**n - ((1 - 5**0.5)/2)**n` and the number of terms `10` to generate the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Square Numbers**: Enter the formula `n**2` and the number of terms `5` to generate the first 5 square numbers.\n3. **Even Numbers**: Enter the formula `2*n` and the number of terms `10` to generate the first 10 even numbers.\n\n**Note**: This program uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the formula, which can pose a security risk if the input formula is not validated properly. In a real-world application, you should use a safer approach, such as using a parsing library or a domain-specific language, to evaluate the formula.",
