  "answer": "**Caesar Cipher Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nA Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each character in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. This implementation provides functions for both encryption and decryption.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass CaesarCipher:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class used to encrypt and decrypt strings using the Caesar cipher algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, shift):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the CaesarCipher object with a shift value.\n\n        Args:\n            shift (int): The number of positions to shift the alphabet.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.shift = shift\n\n    def _shift_char(self, char, direction):\n        \"\"\"\n        Shifts a character by the specified number of positions.\n\n        Args:\n            char (str): The character to shift.\n            direction (int): The direction of the shift (1 for encryption, -1 for decryption).\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The shifted character.\n        \"\"\"\n        if char.isalpha():\n            ascii_offset = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')\n            return chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + direction * self.shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n        else:\n            return char\n\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext):\n        \"\"\"\n        Encrypts the given plaintext using the Caesar cipher algorithm.\n\n        Args:\n            plaintext (str): The text to encrypt.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The encrypted text.\n        \"\"\"\n        return ''.join(self._shift_char(char, 1) for char in plaintext)\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext):\n        \"\"\"\n        Decrypts the given ciphertext using the Caesar cipher algorithm.\n\n        Args:\n            ciphertext (str): The text to decrypt.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The decrypted text.\n        \"\"\"\n        return ''.join(self._shift_char(char, -1) for char in ciphertext)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    cipher = CaesarCipher(3)\n    plaintext = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(f\"Plaintext: {plaintext}\")\n\n    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)\n    print(f\"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}\")\n\n    decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)\n    print(f\"Decrypted Text: {decrypted_text}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `CaesarCipher` class takes a `shift` value in its constructor, which determines the number of positions to shift the alphabet.\n*   The `_shift_char` method shifts a single character by the specified number of positions, handling both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.\n*   The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods apply the Caesar cipher algorithm to the given text, shifting each character accordingly.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `CaesarCipher` class by encrypting and decrypting a sample plaintext.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can adjust the `shift` value to change the encryption and decryption behavior.\n*   This implementation only shifts alphabetic characters, leaving other characters (such as punctuation and whitespace) unchanged.\n*   Keep in mind that the Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher and not suitable for secure communication. For real-world encryption needs, consider using established encryption algorithms like AES.",
