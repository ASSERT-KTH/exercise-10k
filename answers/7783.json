  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The operator can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'. If the operator is '/' and the second number is 0, the program should display an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in C++ that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2;\n    char op;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the first number: \";\n    cin >> n1;\n    cout << \"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \";\n    cin >> op;\n    cout << \"Enter the second number: \";\n    cin >> n2;\n\n    switch (op) {\n        case '+':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << n1 + n2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '-':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << n1 - n2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '*':\n            cout << \"Result: \" << n1 * n2 << endl;\n            break;\n        case '/':\n            if (n2 == 0) {\n                cout << \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed!\" << endl;\n            } else {\n                cout << \"Result: \" << (double)n1 / n2 << endl;\n            }\n            break;\n        default:\n            cout << \"Error: Invalid operator!\" << endl;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined in the breakdown, including:\n\n* Importing the `iostream` library\n* Declaring variables `n1`, `n2`, and `op`\n* Reading input from the user\n* Using a `switch` statement to perform arithmetic operations based on the operator\n* Handling division by zero and invalid operators\n* Printing the result of the operation or an error message as appropriate\n\nNote that I used `double` casting to ensure that the division operation returns a decimal result, as required by the specification.",
