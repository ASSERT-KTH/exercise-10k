  "answer": "**Union of Characters Function**\n================================\n\nHere's a Python function that finds the union of characters between two given strings.\n\n```python\ndef union_of_characters(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of characters between two given strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of unique characters from both strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(str1).union(set(str2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    str1 = \"hello\"\n    str2 = \"world\"\n    union_chars = union_of_characters(str1, str2)\n    print(\"Union of characters:\", union_chars)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `union_of_characters` function takes two strings as input.\n2. It converts each string to a set of characters, which automatically removes duplicates.\n3. It uses the `union` method to find the union of characters between the two sets.\n4. The resulting set of unique characters is returned.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nUnion of characters: {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', 'w', 'r', 'd'}\n```",
