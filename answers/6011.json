  "answer": "**Character Counter Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for a string and prints out the number of characters in that string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_characters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for a string and prints out the number of characters in that string.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    character_count = len(user_string)\n    print(f\"The string '{user_string}' has {character_count} characters.\")\n\ndef main():\n    count_characters()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a string (e.g., \"Hello, World!\").\n3. The program will print out the number of characters in the string (e.g., \"The string 'Hello, World!' has 13 characters.\").\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `count_characters` function uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for a string.\n2. The `len` function is used to count the number of characters in the string.\n3. The result is then printed out to the console using an f-string.\n4. The `main` function calls `count_characters` to start the program.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).",
