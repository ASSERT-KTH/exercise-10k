  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10, then uses a while loop to print out the numbers from 11 to 15.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Printing numbers from 11 to 15 using a while loop\ni = 11\nwhile i <= 15:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\nThis code first uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses a `while` loop to print the numbers from 11 to 15. The `while` loop uses a variable `i` to keep track of the current number, and increments it by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 15.",
