  "answer": "**Minimum Coins Function**\n==========================\n\nThe following function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using dynamic programming. This function assumes that the available coin denominations are 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (int): The amount to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the available coin denominations\n    coins = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50]\n\n    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the target amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # Update the minimum number of coins for the current amount\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If no combination of coins can make the target amount, return -1\n    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return dp[amount]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    amount = 37  # Example amount\n    min_coins_needed = min_coins(amount)\n    if min_coins_needed != -1:\n        print(f\"The minimum number of coins needed to make ${amount / 100:.2f} is {min_coins_needed}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No combination of coins can make ${amount / 100:.2f}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Define the available coin denominations in a list `coins`.\n2.  Create a list `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount. Initialize all values to infinity except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 since no coins are needed to make 0 amount.\n3.  Iterate over each coin denomination and update the minimum number of coins for each amount by considering whether using the current coin results in a smaller number of coins.\n4.  After filling the `dp` list, the minimum number of coins needed for the target amount is stored in `dp[amount]`. If this value remains infinity, it means no combination of coins can make the target amount, so return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the target amount and len(coins) is the number of available coin denominations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(amount), as it uses a list of size amount + 1 to store the minimum number of coins for each amount.",
