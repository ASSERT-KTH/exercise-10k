  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, and then prints out a personalized letter to them. The letter should include the user's name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name and age\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print out a personalized letter to the user\nprint(\"Dear \" + name + \",\")\nprint(\"I hope this letter finds you well. You are currently \" + str(age) + \" years old.\")\nprint(\"I wish you all the best for the future.\")\nprint(\"Sincerely,\")\nprint(\"Your Friend\")\n```\n\nThis program will prompt the user to enter their name and age, and then print out a personalized letter with the provided information.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Python's f-strings (formatted string literals) to make the code more readable and efficient. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for their name and age\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n# Print out a personalized letter to the user\nprint(f\"Dear {name},\")\nprint(f\"I hope this letter finds you well. You are currently {age} years old.\")\nprint(\"I wish you all the best for the future.\")\nprint(\"Sincerely,\")\nprint(\"Your Friend\")\n```\n\nThis version of the program does exactly the same thing, but uses f-strings to insert the `name` and `age` variables directly into the string, which can make the code easier to read and understand.",
