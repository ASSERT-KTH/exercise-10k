  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the GPA of a student given their grades in different subjects. The program should use functions to calculate the GPA. The grades will be provided as a dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades. The GPA is calculated by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of subjects.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gpa(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GPA of a student given their grades in different subjects.\n\n    Args:\n    grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The calculated GPA.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input dictionary is empty\n    if not grades:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all grades\n    total_grades = sum(grades.values())\n\n    # Calculate the total number of subjects\n    total_subjects = len(grades)\n\n    # Calculate the GPA\n    gpa = total_grades / total_subjects\n\n    return gpa\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    grades = {\n        \"Math\": 3.8,\n        \"Science\": 3.5,\n        \"English\": 3.9,\n        \"History\": 3.7\n    }\n\n    gpa = calculate_gpa(grades)\n    print(f\"The GPA is: {gpa:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_gpa` function takes a dictionary `grades` as input where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades.\n* It calculates the sum of all grades using the `sum` function and the total number of subjects using the `len` function.\n* Then it calculates the GPA by dividing the sum of grades by the total number of subjects.\n* The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_gpa` function with an example dictionary of grades.\n* The calculated GPA is printed to the console with two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle the case where the input dictionary is empty to avoid division by zero errors.\n* Consider adding input validation to ensure that the grades are within a valid range (e.g., between 0 and 4).\n* You can modify the program to calculate weighted GPA by multiplying each grade by its corresponding weight and then summing up the weighted grades.",
