  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the given score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to use the program:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the student's score when prompted.\n3. The program will print out the student's grade based on the given score.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* If you enter a score of 92, the program will print out \"The student's grade is: A\".\n* If you enter a score of 75, the program will print out \"The student's grade is: C\".\n* If you enter a score of 58, the program will print out \"The student's grade is: F\".",
