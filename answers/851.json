  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function that chains each function together. This solution will enable you to combine multiple functions into a single, cohesive operation. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef chain_functions(functions):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function \n    that chains each function together. The output of each function is used as the \n    input for the next function in the list.\n\n    Args:\n        functions (list): A list of functions where each function takes one argument.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that chains each function together.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a new function that will be returned by chain_functions\n    def chained_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # Initialize the result with the input to the chained function\n        result = args[0] if args else kwargs.get('input', None)\n        \n        # Iterate over each function in the list of functions\n        for func in functions:\n            # Apply the current function to the result and update the result\n            result = func(result)\n        \n        # Return the final result after applying all functions\n        return result\n    \n    # Return the chained function\n    return chained_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nchained = chain_functions([double, add_one, square])\nprint(chained(5))  # Output: 121\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `chain_functions` function takes a list of functions as an argument and returns a new function, `chained_function`, which chains each function together. This is achieved by defining a nested function within `chain_functions`.\n* The `chained_function` initializes the `result` variable with the input to the chained function and then iterates over each function in the list of functions. It applies the current function to the `result` and updates the `result` with the output of the current function.\n* The `chained_function` returns the final `result` after applying all functions in the list, effectively chaining them together.\n* In the example usage, three simple functions (`double`, `add_one`, and `square`) are chained together using the `chain_functions` function, demonstrating how to use the returned `chained_function` to perform a series of operations on an input value.",
