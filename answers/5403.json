  "answer": "### is_prime Function\n#### Description\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # Check if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num}: {is_prime(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's prime or not.\n*   It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it immediately returns `False` since these numbers are not prime by definition.\n*   Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check for divisors. This is an optimization, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n*   If it finds a divisor (i.e., `n % i == 0`), it returns `False`.\n*   If it completes the loop without finding any divisors, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(\u221an), where n is the input number. This is because it only needs to check up to the square root of n for potential divisors.",
