  "answer": "**Minimal Rotation of a String**\n=====================================\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal rotation of a given string that is lexicographically smallest. A rotation of a string is obtained by moving the first character to the end of the string.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nWe can solve this problem by generating all rotations of the string and comparing them lexicographically.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef minimal_rotation(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimal rotation of a string that is lexicographically smallest.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The minimal rotation of the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate all rotations of the string\n    rotations = [s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s))]\n\n    # Find the lexicographically smallest rotation\n    return min(rotations)\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"bca\"\nprint(minimal_rotation(s))  # Output: \"abc\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Generate all rotations of the input string `s` by moving the first character to the end of the string for each rotation.\n2.  Use the built-in `min` function in Python to find the lexicographically smallest rotation.\n3.  The `min` function compares strings lexicographically by default, so no additional comparison function is needed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because generating all rotations takes O(n^2) time and finding the minimum rotation takes O(n) time.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we need to store all rotations of the string.",
