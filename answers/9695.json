  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a user's name, age, and location as input, then prints out a formatted string containing this information.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_user_info():\n    # Get user input\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n    location = input(\"Please enter your location: \")\n\n    # Print out the user information in a formatted string\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and I am from {location}.\")\n\n# Call the function to start the program\nprint_user_info()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1. **Get User Input**: The program uses the built-in `input()` function to get the user's name, age, and location. Note that `age` is converted to an integer using `int()`, assuming the user will enter a valid integer.\n2. **Print User Information**: The program uses an f-string (formatted string) to print out the user's information in a readable format.\n3. **Call the Function**: The `print_user_info()` function is called to start the program.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your name, age, and location. After entering the information, the program will print out a greeting with your details. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John Doe\nPlease enter your age: 30\nPlease enter your location: New York\nHello, my name is John Doe, I am 30 years old, and I am from New York.\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates basic user input and string formatting in Python.",
