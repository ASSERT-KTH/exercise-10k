  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10, then asks the user to guess the number. After each guess, tell the user if their guess was higher or lower than the actual number.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the player has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. After each guess, the program checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and ends the loop.\n4. If the user's guess is not correct, the program tells the user if their guess was too high or too low, and asks for another guess.\n5. The program also keeps track of the number of tries the user has made, and displays this number when the user finally guesses the correct number.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* The user guesses the correct number on the first try.\n* The user guesses a number that is too high, and the program tells them to try again with a lower number.\n* The user guesses a number that is too low, and the program tells them to try again with a higher number.\n* The user enters an invalid input, such as a string or a number outside the range of 1 to 10, and the program asks them to try again.",
