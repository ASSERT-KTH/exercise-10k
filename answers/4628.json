  "answer": "**Merging Two Lists**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that merges two lists into a single list.\n\n```python\ndef merge_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two lists into a single list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to merge.\n        list2 (list): The second list to merge.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list1 + list2\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n    merged_list = merge_lists(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Merged List:\", merged_list)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `merge_lists` function takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`.\n2. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists into a single list.\n3. The merged list is then returned by the function.\n4. In the `main` function, we create two example lists, `list1` and `list2`, and pass them to the `merge_lists` function.\n5. The merged list is then printed to the console.\n\n**Output**\n--------\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n```\nMerged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```",
