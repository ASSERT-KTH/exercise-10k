  "answer": "### Recursive Function to Calculate Sum of List\n\nHere's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_sum(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively calculates the sum of all numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if the list is empty, return 0\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n    # Recursive case: add the first number to the sum of the rest of the list\n    else:\n        return numbers[0] + recursive_sum(numbers[1:])\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nresult = recursive_sum(numbers)\nprint(f\"The sum of the numbers in the list is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function works by recursively calling itself with a smaller list until it reaches the base case (an empty list). At each recursive step, it adds the first number in the list to the sum of the rest of the list.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. The function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. If the list is empty, it returns 0 (base case).\n3. If the list is not empty, it adds the first number to the sum of the rest of the list (recursive case).\n4. The function calls itself with the rest of the list (`numbers[1:]`) until it reaches the base case.\n5. The final result is the sum of all numbers in the original list.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the sum of the numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and print the result. The output should be:\n```\nThe sum of the numbers in the list is: 10\n```",
