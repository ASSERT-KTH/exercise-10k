  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to print a pattern of asterisks (*) where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef print_asterisk_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of asterisks where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows in the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Print i asterisks in each row\n        print('* ' * i)\n\n# Test the function\nprint_asterisk_pattern(5)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program with `n = 5`, it will print the following pattern:\n```\n* \n* * \n* * * \n* * * * \n* * * * * \n```\n\nIn this program, the `print_asterisk_pattern` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of rows in the pattern. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n`. In each iteration, it prints `i` asterisks, where `i` is the current row number.\n\nYou can adjust the value of `n` to print patterns with different numbers of rows.",
