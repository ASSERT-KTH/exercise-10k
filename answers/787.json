  "answer": "**Circle Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses the `math` module to access the constant `pi`.\n2. The `calculate_circle_area` function takes the radius as input and returns the area of the circle.\n3. The area is calculated using the formula `A = \u03c0r^2`, where `A` is the area and `r` is the radius.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius, calculates the area, and prints the result.\n5. The program handles negative radius inputs by raising a `ValueError`.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a radius of `5` when prompted.\n* The program will output the area of the circle, which is approximately `78.54`.",
