  "answer": "Variable Scope\n===============\n\nThe scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where the variable is defined and accessible. In this example, we will demonstrate the concept of variable scope by declaring a variable inside and outside a function.\n\n### Example Code\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable outside the function\nx = 10\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Declare a variable inside the function\n    y = 20\n    \n    # Access the variable declared outside the function\n    print(\"Value of x inside the function:\", x)\n    \n    # Access the variable declared inside the function\n    print(\"Value of y inside the function:\", y)\n\n# Access the variable declared outside the function\nprint(\"Value of x outside the function:\", x)\n\n# Try to access the variable declared inside the function\ntry:\n    print(\"Value of y outside the function:\", y)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Error: y is not defined outside the function\")\n\n# Call the function\nmy_function()\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nValue of x outside the function: 10\nError: y is not defined outside the function\nValue of x inside the function: 10\nValue of y inside the function: 20\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We declare a variable `x` outside the function with a value of 10. This variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.\n*   We declare a variable `y` inside the function with a value of 20. This variable is only accessible within the function.\n*   When we try to access `y` outside the function, we get an error because `y` is not defined in that scope.\n*   The function `my_function()` can access both `x` and `y` because `x` is in the global scope and `y` is in the local scope.\n\n### Scope Rules\n\n*   **Global scope**: Variables declared outside any function or class are in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n*   **Local scope**: Variables declared inside a function or class are in the local scope and can only be accessed within that function or class.\n*   **Enclosing scope**: Variables declared in an outer function or class are in the enclosing scope and can be accessed from inner functions or classes.",
