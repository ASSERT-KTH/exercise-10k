  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that checks if a student is eligible for a scholarship based on their age and score:\n\n```python\ndef check_scholarship_eligibility(age, score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a student is eligible for a scholarship based on their age and score.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the student.\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the student is eligible for a scholarship, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the eligibility criteria\n    min_age = 16\n    max_age = 25\n    min_score = 80.0\n\n    # Check if the student's age is within the eligible range\n    if age < min_age or age > max_age:\n        return False  # Student's age is not within the eligible range\n\n    # Check if the student's score is above the minimum required score\n    if score < min_score:\n        return False  # Student's score is below the minimum required score\n\n    # If both conditions are met, the student is eligible for a scholarship\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's age and score from the user\n    age = int(input(\"Enter the student's age: \"))\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (out of 100): \"))\n\n    # Check if the student is eligible for a scholarship\n    if check_scholarship_eligibility(age, score):\n        print(\"The student is eligible for a scholarship.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The student is not eligible for a scholarship.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `check_scholarship_eligibility` function checks if a student is eligible for a scholarship based on their age and score. It returns `True` if the student is eligible and `False` otherwise.\n*   The function uses conditional statements to check if the student's age is within the eligible range (16-25 years) and if their score is above the minimum required score (80.0).\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter the student's age and score. It then calls the `check_scholarship_eligibility` function to determine if the student is eligible for a scholarship and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Eligible student**: If the user enters an age of 20 and a score of 90.0, the program will output: \"The student is eligible for a scholarship.\"\n*   **Ineligible student (age)**: If the user enters an age of 30 and a score of 90.0, the program will output: \"The student is not eligible for a scholarship.\"\n*   **Ineligible student (score)**: If the user enters an age of 20 and a score of 70.0, the program will output: \"The student is not eligible for a scholarship.\"",
