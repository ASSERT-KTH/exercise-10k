  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that does what you requested. It asks the user 5 questions, keeps track of the score, and tells the user whether their answer is correct or not.\n\n```python\n# Import the required modules\nimport random\n\n# Define the questions, options, and answers\nquestions = [\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Berlin\", \"Paris\", \"London\", \"Rome\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Paris\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Earth\", \"Saturn\", \"Jupiter\", \"Uranus\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Jupiter\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Raphael\", \"Caravaggio\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Ag\", \"Au\", \"Hg\", \"Pb\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Au\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the largest mammal?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Blue whale\", \"African elephant\", \"Hippopotamus\", \"Giraffe\"],\n        \"answer\": \"Blue whale\"\n    }\n]\n\n# Initialize the score\nscore = 0\n\n# Loop through each question\nfor i, question in enumerate(questions, start=1):\n    print(f\"\\nQuestion {i}: {question['question']}\")\n    \n    # Shuffle the options\n    random_options = question[\"options\"].copy()\n    random.shuffle(random_options)\n    \n    # Print the options\n    for j, option in enumerate(random_options, start=1):\n        print(f\"{j}. {option}\")\n    \n    # Get the user's answer\n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_answer_index = int(input(\"\\nEnter the number of your answer: \"))\n            if 1 <= user_answer_index <= len(random_options):\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid option number. Please try again.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    \n    # Check if the user's answer is correct\n    user_answer = random_options[user_answer_index - 1]\n    if user_answer == question[\"answer\"]:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n        score += 1\n    else:\n        print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {question['answer']}.\")\n\n# Print the final score\nprint(f\"\\nYour final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and answer the questions to test your knowledge.\n* Use the program as a template to create your own quiz with custom questions and answers.\n* Modify the program to keep track of the user's answers and provide feedback at the end.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The program defines a list of questions, options, and answers.\n2. It initializes the score to 0.\n3. It loops through each question, shuffling the options and printing them to the user.\n4. The user is prompted to enter the number of their answer.\n5. The program checks if the user's answer is correct and updates the score accordingly.\n6. After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score.",
