Mad Libs is a word game where you fill in the blanks of a story with different types of words to create a funny and silly story.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a function to get user input for a specific word type\ndef get_word(prompt):\n    while True:\n        word = input(prompt)\n        if word:\n            return word\n        else:\n            print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\n# Define a function to generate the Mad Libs story\ndef generate_mad_libs_story():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Mad Libs story generator!\")\n    print(\"Please provide the following words:\")\n\n    # Get user input for different word types\n    name = get_word(\"Enter a name: \")\n    adjective1 = get_word(\"Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, purple): \")\n    adjective2 = get_word(\"Enter another adjective: \")\n    adjective3 = get_word(\"Enter one more adjective: \")\n    noun1 = get_word(\"Enter a noun (e.g. book, car, apple): \")\n    noun2 = get_word(\"Enter another noun: \")\n    animal = get_word(\"Enter an animal: \")\n    food = get_word(\"Enter a food: \")\n\n    # Define the Mad Libs story template\n    story_template = f\"\"\"\nOne day, {name} was walking through the forest when they came across a {adjective1} {noun1}.\nIt was so {adjective2} that {name} couldn't help but {adjective3} with excitement.\nAs they approached the {noun1}, a {animal} jumped out from behind it and started to {food}.\n{name} was so surprised that they {food} all over their shirt.\nIt was a {adjective1} day, but {name} didn't let it ruin their {adjective2} mood.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Print the generated Mad Libs story\n    print(\"\\nHere is your Mad Libs story:\")\n    print(story_template)\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    generate_mad_libs_story()\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g. `mad_libs.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g. `python mad_libs.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the required words, and the program will generate a Mad Libs story based on your input.\n\n```\nWelcome to the Mad Libs story generator!\nPlease provide the following words:\nEnter a name: John\nEnter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, purple): happy\nEnter another adjective: tall\nEnter one more adjective: silly\nEnter a noun (e.g. book, car, apple): car\nEnter another noun: tree\nEnter an animal: dog\nEnter a food: pizza\n\nHere is your Mad Libs story:\n\nOne day, John was walking through the forest when they came across a happy car.\nIt was so tall that John couldn't help but silly with excitement.\nAs they approached the car, a dog jumped out from behind it and started to pizza.\nJohn was so surprised that they pizza all over their shirt.\nIt was a happy day, but John didn't let it ruin their tall mood.\n```",
