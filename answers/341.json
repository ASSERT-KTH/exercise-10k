  "prompt": "Write a program to access and print the elements of an array at specific indices.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accesses and prints elements of an array at specific indices:\n\n```python\n# Define an array\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Define specific indices\nindices = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n# Access and print elements at specific indices\nfor i in indices:\n    print(f\"Element at index {i}: {array[i]}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define an array `array` with elements from 1 to 10.\n*   We define a list of specific indices `indices` that we want to access in the array.\n*   We use a `for` loop to iterate over each index `i` in `indices`.\n*   For each index `i`, we print the element at that index in the array using `array[i]`.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nElement at index 0: 1\nElement at index 2: 3\nElement at index 4: 5\nElement at index 6: 7\nElement at index 8: 9\n```\n\n### Note\n\n*   In Python, array indices start from 0. Therefore, the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.\n*   If you try to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `array[10]`), Python will raise an `IndexError`. To avoid this, make sure to check if the index is within the valid range before accessing it.\n\n### Accessing Elements in a Multidimensional Array\n\nIf you have a multidimensional array, you can access elements using multiple indices. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define a 2D array\narray_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n# Define specific indices\nindices_2d = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]\n\n# Access and print elements at specific indices\nfor i, j in indices_2d:\n    print(f\"Element at index ({i}, {j}): {array_2d[i][j]}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nElement at index (0, 0): 1\nElement at index (1, 1): 5\nElement at index (2, 2): 9\n```",
