  "answer": "**Reading File Contents**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of how to ask the user for a file name and print out its contents using Python:\n\n```python\ndef read_file_contents(file_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads and returns the contents of a file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_name (str): The name of the file to read.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The contents of the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n            return file.read()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{file_name}' not found.\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for a file name\n    file_name = input(\"Please enter the file name: \")\n\n    # Read and print the file contents\n    contents = read_file_contents(file_name)\n    if contents is not None:\n        print(contents)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `read_file_contents` function takes a file name as input and attempts to open the file in read-only mode.\n2. If the file is found, it reads the contents and returns them as a string.\n3. If the file is not found, it catches the `FileNotFoundError`, prints an error message, and returns `None`.\n4. In the `main` function, it asks the user for a file name using the `input` function.\n5. It then calls the `read_file_contents` function with the user-provided file name and prints the contents if they are not `None`.\n\n**Example Usage**\n----------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file, for example, `read_file.py`.\n2. Run the script using Python, for example, `python read_file.py`.\n3. When prompted, enter the name of a file you want to read, for example, `example.txt`.\n4. The script will print the contents of the file if it exists.",
