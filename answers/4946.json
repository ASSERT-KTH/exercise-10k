  "prompt": "Create a program that finds the maximum of two numbers using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b):\n    if a > b:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return b\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 20\nmax_num = find_max(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The maximum of {num1} and {num2} is {max_num}.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function called `find_max` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input. It uses an `if` statement to compare `a` and `b`, returning the larger number. If `a` is not greater than `b`, it returns `b` (which could be equal to `a` if they're equal). The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with two numbers.",
