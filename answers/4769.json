  "prompt": "Write a program that determines the day of the week based on the date. If the date is between Monday and Friday, the day is a weekday. If the date is Saturday or Sunday, the day is a weekend day.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses the datetime module to determine whether a given date is a weekday or a weekend day.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef is_weekday(year, month, day):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a given date is a weekday or not.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year of the date.\n        month (int): The month of the date.\n        day (int): The day of the date.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the date is a weekday, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = datetime.date(year, month, day)\n    return date.weekday() < 5  # Monday is 0 and Friday is 4\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month: \"))\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day: \"))\n\n    if is_weekday(year, month, day):\n        print(f\"{year}-{month}-{day} is a weekday.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year}-{month}-{day} is a weekend day.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `is_weekday` that takes a year, month, and day as input and returns True if the date is a weekday and False otherwise. We use the `weekday` method of the `date` object to get the day of the week as an integer (where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6). If this integer is less than 5, the date is a weekday.\n\nIn the `main` function, we ask the user to input a year, month, and day, and then we call the `is_weekday` function to determine whether the date is a weekday or not. Finally, we print out the result.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `weekday.py`), and then run it with Python (e.g., `python weekday.py`). Follow the prompts to input a year, month, and day, and the program will tell you whether the date is a weekday or a weekend day.",
