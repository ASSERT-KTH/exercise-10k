  "answer": "**Tic Tac Toe Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game where a user can play against the computer. The computer's moves are chosen randomly.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combo[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Make a random move for the computer.\"\"\"\n    available_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    move = random.choice(available_moves)\n    board[move] = \"O\"\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Tic Tac Toe.\"\"\"\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move(board)\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\ngame()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_board` function prints the current state of the board.\n2. The `check_win` function checks if there is a winner by examining all possible winning combinations.\n3. The `computer_move` function makes a random move for the computer.\n4. The `game` function plays a game of Tic Tac Toe, asking the user for input and making computer moves in response.\n5. The game continues until there is a winner or a tie.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo play the game, simply run the `game` function. The user will be prompted to enter their moves, and the computer will make its moves in response. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.",
