  "prompt": "Write a function that checks if a given number is within a specified range.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to help you create a function that checks if a given number falls within a specified range. This will involve defining the function's parameters, implementing the logic to perform the check, and returning the result. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef check_number_in_range(number, min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is within a specified range.\n\n    Args:\n        number (int): The number to be checked.\n        min_value (int): The minimum value of the range (inclusive).\n        max_value (int): The maximum value of the range (inclusive).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the number is greater than or equal to the minimum value\n    # This is because the range is inclusive, meaning it includes the minimum value\n    is_greater_than_min = number >= min_value\n    \n    # Next, we need to check if the number is less than or equal to the maximum value\n    # This is because the range is inclusive, meaning it includes the maximum value\n    is_less_than_max = number <= max_value\n    \n    # Finally, we return True if both conditions are met, and False otherwise\n    # This is done using the 'and' operator, which returns True only if both conditions are True\n    return is_greater_than_min and is_less_than_max\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(check_number_in_range(5, 1, 10))  # Returns: True\nprint(check_number_in_range(15, 1, 10))  # Returns: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_number_in_range` takes three parameters: `number`, `min_value`, and `max_value`, representing the number to be checked and the minimum and maximum values of the range, respectively.\n* It first checks if the `number` is greater than or equal to `min_value` and less than or equal to `max_value`, storing these conditions in `is_greater_than_min` and `is_less_than_max`.\n* The function then returns `True` if both conditions are met (`is_greater_than_min and is_less_than_max`) and `False` otherwise, effectively indicating whether the `number` is within the specified range.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different inputs, such as checking if the number 5 is within the range 1 to 10, and if the number 15 is within the same range.",
