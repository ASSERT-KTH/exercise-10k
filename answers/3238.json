  "answer": "**Rotated Sorted Array Search Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program performs a binary search on a rotated sorted array to find a target element. The array is considered sorted in ascending order, but it has been rotated (clockwise) by some number of positions.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef search_rotated_array(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a rotated sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The rotated sorted array.\n        target (int): The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return -1\n\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n\n        # Check if the left half is sorted\n        if arr[left] <= arr[mid]:\n            # If the target is in the sorted left half, update the right pointer\n            if arr[left] <= target < arr[mid]:\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        # If the left half is not sorted, the right half must be sorted\n        else:\n            # If the target is in the sorted right half, update the left pointer\n            if arr[mid] < target <= arr[right]:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]\n    target = 0\n    result = search_rotated_array(arr, target)\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1.  The program uses a binary search approach to find the target element in the rotated sorted array.\n2.  It first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not found.\n3.  It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n4.  The program enters a while loop, which continues until `left` is greater than `right`.\n5.  Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the element at this index is equal to the target. If it is, the function returns `mid`.\n6.  If the middle element is not the target, the program checks if the left half of the array is sorted by comparing the elements at the `left` and `mid` indices.\n7.  If the left half is sorted, it checks if the target is within the range of the sorted left half. If it is, the program updates the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, it updates the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n8.  If the left half is not sorted, the program knows that the right half must be sorted. It checks if the target is within the range of the sorted right half and updates the pointers accordingly.\n9.  If the while loop ends without finding the target, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the array.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the program uses a binary search approach, which reduces the search space by half at each step.",
