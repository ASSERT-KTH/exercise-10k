  "answer": "**Score Report Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes in a team's name and score, then prints out the score report based on the score.\n\n```python\ndef score_report(team_name, score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the score report for a given team.\n\n    Args:\n        team_name (str): The name of the team.\n        score (int): The score of the team.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score > 100:\n        print(f\"{team_name} scored {score}. High score!\")\n    elif score >= 50:\n        print(f\"{team_name} scored {score}. Good score\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{team_name} scored {score}. Low score\")\n\ndef main():\n    team_name = input(\"Enter the team's name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Enter the team's score: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid score.\")\n    score_report(team_name, score)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n\n1. The `score_report` function takes in a team's name and score, and prints out the score report based on the score.\n2. If the score is above 100, it prints \"High score!\".\n3. If the score is 50 or above but not above 100, it prints \"Good score\".\n4. If the score is below 50, it prints \"Low score\".\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the team's name and score, and calls the `score_report` function with the user's input.\n6. The program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input for the score. If the user enters a non-integer value, the program will prompt the user to enter a valid score.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\n```\nEnter the team's name: Team A\nEnter the team's score: 120\nTeam A scored 120. High score!\n```\n\n```\nEnter the team's name: Team B\nEnter the team's score: 60\nTeam B scored 60. Good score\n```\n\n```\nEnter the team's name: Team C\nEnter the team's score: 30\nTeam C scored 30. Low score\n```",
