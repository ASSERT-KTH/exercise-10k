  "answer": "Here is a Python program that creates a 5x5 spiral pattern of numbers using nested for loops.\n\n```python\ndef print_spiral(n):\n    # Create an empty 5x5 matrix\n    matrix = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize the counter\n    counter = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the start and end indices\n    start_row, end_row = 0, n\n    start_col, end_col = 0, n\n    \n    # Loop until the entire matrix is filled\n    while start_row < end_row and start_col < end_col:\n        \n        # Fill the first row\n        for i in range(start_col, end_col):\n            matrix[start_row][i] = counter\n            counter += 1\n        start_row += 1\n        \n        # Fill the last column\n        for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n            matrix[i][end_col-1] = counter\n            counter += 1\n        end_col -= 1\n        \n        # Fill the last row\n        if start_row < end_row:\n            for i in range(end_col-1, start_col-1, -1):\n                matrix[end_row-1][i] = counter\n                counter += 1\n            end_row -= 1\n        \n        # Fill the first column\n        if start_col < end_col:\n            for i in range(end_row-1, start_row-1, -1):\n                matrix[i][start_col] = counter\n                counter += 1\n            start_col += 1\n    \n    # Print the spiral matrix\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(' '.join(str(num).ljust(2) for num in row))\n\n# Test the function\nprint_spiral(5)\n```\n\nThis program will output the following 5x5 spiral pattern of numbers:\n```\n 1  2  3  4  5\n16 17 18 19  6\n15 24 25 20  7\n14 23 22 21  8\n13 12 11 10  9\n```\nThis program works by maintaining four indices (start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col) that define the current boundaries of the matrix. It fills the matrix in a spiral pattern by iterating over the rows and columns in a specific order. The counter variable keeps track of the current number to be filled in the matrix. The `ljust(2)` function is used to left-justify the numbers in each row, so that the output is lined up neatly.",
