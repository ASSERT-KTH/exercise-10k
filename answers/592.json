  "answer": "### Power of Two Checker Program\n#### Description\nThis program checks whether a given number is a power of two.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is a power of two.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is a power of two, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 32]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is a power of two: {is_power_of_two(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\nThis program uses bitwise operations to check if a number is a power of two. The idea is that in binary representation, powers of two have exactly one bit set to 1 (the bit in the place that corresponds to that power of two), and all other bits are 0.\n\nThe `is_power_of_two` function uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if a number is a power of two. If `n` is a power of two, then `n - 1` will have all the bits to the right of the leftmost 1 in `n` set to 1, and all other bits set to 0. Therefore, `n & (n - 1)` will be 0 if `n` is a power of two, and non-zero otherwise.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `is_power_of_two` function with a list of example numbers.\n\n#### Example Output\n```\n1 is a power of two: True\n2 is a power of two: True\n3 is a power of two: False\n4 is a power of two: True\n5 is a power of two: False\n8 is a power of two: True\n16 is a power of two: True\n32 is a power of two: True\n```",
