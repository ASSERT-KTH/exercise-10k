  "prompt": "Create a program that prints a pattern of numbers based on the input number. The pattern should be a square of numbers where each row contains the numbers from 1 to the input number. Use loops to generate the pattern.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(1, 6):\n        print(j, end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nThis code will print the following pattern:\n```\n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. The outer loop `for i in range(1, 6):` iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).\n2. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop `for j in range(1, 6):` iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).\n3. Inside the inner loop, the `print(j, end=' ')` statement prints the current value of `j` followed by a space character. The `end=' '` argument tells Python to print a space character after each number, rather than a newline character.\n4. After the inner loop completes, the `print()` statement prints a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line.\n\nNote that the variable `i` is not actually used in the code, so it's not doing anything useful. However, it's still necessary to have the outer loop to generate the pattern. If you wanted to make the code more efficient, you could use a constant value instead of a loop variable `i`. For example:\n```\nfor _ in range(5):\n    for j in range(1, 6):\n        print(j, end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nThis code is equivalent to the original code, but uses a throwaway variable `_` instead of `i`.",
