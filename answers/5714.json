  "answer": "Here's a simple chatbot written in Python that responds to basic user input:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Dictionary of chatbot responses\nresponses = {\n    'hello': ['Hi, how are you?', 'Hello!', 'Hey, what\\'s up?'],\n    'how are you': ['I\\'m doing great, thanks!', 'I\\'m good, thanks for asking!', 'I\\'m just a chatbot, I don\\'t have feelings, but thanks for asking!'],\n    'what is your name': ['My name is Chatbot!', 'I\\'m an AI chatbot, I don\\'t have a personal name.', 'You can call me Bot!'],\n    'default': ['I didn\\'t understand that.', 'Can you please rephrase?', 'I\\'m not sure what you mean.']\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n\n    if 'hello' in user_input:\n        return random.choice(responses['hello'])\n    elif 'how are you' in user_input:\n        return random.choice(responses['how are you'])\n    elif 'what is your name' in user_input:\n        return random.choice(responses['what is your name'])\n    else:\n        return random.choice(responses['default'])\n\ndef main():\n    print('Welcome to the chatbot! Type \"quit\" to exit.')\n    while True:\n        user_input = input('You: ')\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        print('Chatbot: ', get_response(user_input))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The chatbot uses a dictionary to store responses to different user inputs.\n2. The `get_response` function takes the user's input and checks if it matches any of the keys in the dictionary.\n3. If a match is found, the function returns a random response from the corresponding list.\n4. If no match is found, the function returns a random response from the 'default' list.\n5. The `main` function runs the chatbot in a loop, prompting the user for input and printing the chatbot's response.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n* User types \"hello\" and the chatbot responds with a random greeting.\n* User types \"how are you\" and the chatbot responds with a random response about its status.\n* User types \"what is your name\" and the chatbot responds with a random response about its name.\n* User types something that doesn't match any of the dictionary keys and the chatbot responds with a random \"default\" response.\n\nNote: This is a very basic chatbot and there are many ways to improve it, such as adding more responses, using natural language processing techniques, and integrating with external APIs.",
