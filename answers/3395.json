  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the standard deviation of a list of integers. It uses the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the list.\n2. Calculate the variance of the list.\n3. Calculate the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the variance\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n    return standard_deviation\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_standard_deviation` function takes a list of integers as input.\n*   It calculates the mean by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count.\n*   It calculates the variance by summing the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the count.\n*   It calculates the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n*   The function returns the standard deviation as a float.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function calculates the population standard deviation. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation, you should divide by `len(numbers) - 1` when calculating the variance.",
