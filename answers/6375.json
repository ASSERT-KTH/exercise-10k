  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array, a start index, and an end index as input and returns a new array containing the elements between the start and end indices",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the provided specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nstd::vector<int> sliceArray(std::vector<int> &arr, int start, int stop) {\n    std::vector<int> slicedArray;\n    for (int i = start; i < stop; i++) {\n        slicedArray.push_back(arr[i]);\n    }\n    return slicedArray;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n    int start = 2;\n    int stop = 6;\n    std::vector<int> result = sliceArray(arr, start, stop);\n    for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {\n        std::cout << result[i] << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code defines a function `sliceArray` that takes a reference to a vector of integers and two integer indices as input. It creates a new vector `slicedArray` and populates it with the elements of the input vector between the `start` and `stop` indices. The function then returns the `slicedArray`.\n\nIn the `main` function, an example array `arr` is created, and two indices `start` and `stop` are defined. The `sliceArray` function is called with these inputs, and the resulting array is stored in the `result` variable. The elements of the `result` array are then printed to the console.\n\nNote that, as mentioned in the specification, the `sliceArray` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements between the `start` and `stop` indices. This is because the function uses a loop to iterate over these elements and copy them into the new array.",
