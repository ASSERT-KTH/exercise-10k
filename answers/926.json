  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game using if/else statements in Python.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_game():\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The program asks the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).\n2. The program checks if the user's input is valid. If not, it asks for input again.\n3. The program generates the computer's choice randomly from the list of possible choices.\n4. The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n5. The program prints out the result of the game.\n6. The program asks the user if they want to play again. If yes, the game continues; otherwise, the program ends.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* User chooses rock, computer chooses scissors: User wins.\n* User chooses paper, computer chooses rock: User wins.\n* User chooses scissors, computer chooses paper: User wins.\n* User chooses rock, computer chooses paper: User loses.\n* User chooses paper, computer chooses scissors: User loses.\n* User chooses scissors, computer chooses rock: User loses.\n* User chooses rock, computer chooses rock: It's a tie.",
