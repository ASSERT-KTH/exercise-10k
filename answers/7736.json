  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, output 'Invalid score'.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Python:\n```\ndef convert_to_letter(score):\n    if 90 <= score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    elif 80 <= score <= 89:\n        return 'B'\n    elif 70 <= score <= 79:\n        return 'C'\n    elif 60 <= score <= 69:\n        return 'D'\n    elif 0 <= score <= 59:\n        return 'F'\n    else:\n        return 'Invalid score'\n\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\nletter = convert_to_letter(score)\nprint(\"Your grade is: \", letter)\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified:\n\n1. The `convert_to_letter` function takes an integer `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade as a string.\n2. The function uses if-elif-else statements to check the score and return the corresponding grade.\n3. The main part of the program prompts the user to enter their score, calls the `convert_to_letter` function with the input score, and prints the resulting grade.\n\nNote that I've used the `int` function to convert the user's input to an integer, as specified in the requirements. I've also used the `print` function to print the result to the console.",
