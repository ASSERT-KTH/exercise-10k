  "prompt": "Write a program that rounds a given number to the nearest integer or to a specified number of decimal places.",
  "answer": "Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef round_number(num, decimal_places=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer or to a specified number of decimal places.\n\n    Args:\n    num (float): The number to be rounded.\n    decimal_places (int, optional): The number of decimal places to round to. Defaults to None, which rounds to the nearest integer.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The rounded number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input number is a float\n    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input number must be a float or an integer.\")\n\n    # If decimal_places is not specified, round to the nearest integer\n    if decimal_places is None:\n        # Use the built-in round function to round to the nearest integer\n        return round(num)\n    else:\n        # Check if decimal_places is a non-negative integer\n        if not isinstance(decimal_places, int) or decimal_places < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Decimal places must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        \n        # Use the built-in round function to round to the specified number of decimal places\n        return round(num, decimal_places)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(round_number(10.1234))  # Output: 10\nprint(round_number(10.1234, 2))  # Output: 10.12\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function called `round_number` that takes a number (`num`) and an optional argument (`decimal_places`) as input.\n*   The `decimal_places` argument specifies the number of decimal places to round to. If it's not provided, the function rounds to the nearest integer.\n*   We use the built-in `round` function in Python to perform the rounding.\n*   We include input validation to ensure that the input number is a float or an integer and that the decimal places (if specified) is a non-negative integer.\n*   Finally, we provide example usage of the function to demonstrate its functionality.",
