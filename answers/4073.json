  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns -1 if the first string is less than the second string, 0 if the strings are equal, and 1 if the first string is greater than the second string.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in Python that matches the given specification:\n\n```python\n# This script compares two strings lexicographically.\n\ndef cmp_str(s1, s2):\n    if s1 < s2:\n        return -1\n    elif s1 == s2:\n        return 0\n    elif s1 > s2:\n        return 1\n\n# Test the function\ns1 = \"hello\"\ns2 = \"world\"\nprint(cmp_str(s1, s2))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `cmp_str` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input and returns an integer indicating their lexicographical order. The function uses Python's built-in string comparison operators (`<`, `==`, and `>`) to compare the strings. The test at the end demonstrates the function's usage with two example strings, \"hello\" and \"world\".",
