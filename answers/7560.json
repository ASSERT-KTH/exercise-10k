  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with each number squared, using an anonymous function.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared, using an anonymous function. This will help you understand how to apply a transformation to each element in a list. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of numbers as input, squares each number using an anonymous function, \n    and returns the new list with the squared numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with each number squared.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n\n    # Then, we use a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is squared.\n    # We use the map() function to apply the anonymous function (lambda) to each element in the list.\n    # The lambda function takes one argument and returns its square.\n    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n\n    # Finally, we return the new list with the squared numbers.\n    return squared_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(square_numbers(numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `square_numbers` starts by validating its input, checking if `numbers` is indeed a list. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes the `map()` function in combination with an anonymous function defined by `lambda x: x**2` to square each number in the input list `numbers`.\n* The result of `map()` is converted to a list and stored in `squared_numbers`, which is then returned by the function.\n* An example usage demonstrates how to call `square_numbers` with a list of numbers and print the resulting list of squared numbers.",
