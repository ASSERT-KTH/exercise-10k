  "answer": "**Loan Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the monthly payment of a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_monthly_payment(principal, interest_rate, loan_term):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly payment of a loan.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): The principal amount of the loan.\n    - interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate of the loan as a decimal.\n    - loan_term (int): The loan term in years.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n    number_of_payments = loan_term * 12\n\n    monthly_payment = principal * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments / (\n                (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments - 1)\n\n    return round(monthly_payment, 2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 6 for 6%): \")) / 100\n    loan_term = int(input(\"Enter the loan term in years: \"))\n\n    monthly_payment = calculate_monthly_payment(principal, interest_rate, loan_term)\n\n    print(f\"The monthly payment is: ${monthly_payment}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_monthly_payment` function takes in the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term as arguments.\n2. It calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.\n3. It calculates the number of payments by multiplying the loan term by 12.\n4. It uses the formula for monthly payments (`M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n \u2013 1]`) to calculate the monthly payment amount.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to input the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term.\n6. It calls the `calculate_monthly_payment` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the monthly payment for a $200,000 mortgage with an annual interest rate of 6% and a loan term of 30 years.\n* Calculate the monthly payment for a $10,000 car loan with an annual interest rate of 8% and a loan term of 5 years.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the interest rate is fixed and that the loan is repaid in equal monthly installments. In practice, loan terms and interest rates may vary, and other factors such as fees and taxes may affect the monthly payment amount.",
