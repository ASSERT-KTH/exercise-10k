  "answer": "**Mode Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program calculates the mode of a given list of numbers. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes (in case of multiple modes).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    counts = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of modes.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the list.\n3. It finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the values of the `counts` dictionary.\n4. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency by using a list comprehension on the `counts` dictionary.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_mode` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculating the mode of a list of exam scores to find the most common score.\n* Finding the mode of a list of product ratings to determine the most popular rating.\n* Analyzing the mode of a list of sensor readings to identify the most frequent value.",
