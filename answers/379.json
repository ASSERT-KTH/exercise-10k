  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The user should be prompted to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then the program should display the calculated area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n# Function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"\\nResults:\")\n    print(f\"Area: {area}\")\n    print(f\"Perimeter: {perimeter}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n\n1.  **Defining Functions**: The code starts by defining two functions: `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`. These functions take the length and width of the rectangle as input and return the calculated area and perimeter, respectively.\n2.  **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, calculates the area and perimeter using the defined functions, and then prints the results.\n3.  **User Input**: The program uses the `input` function to get the length and width from the user. The input values are converted to `float` to allow for decimal numbers.\n4.  **Printing Results**: The calculated area and perimeter are printed to the console using f-strings, which provide a readable and formatted way to display the results.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `rectangle_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rectangle_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and the program will display the calculated area and perimeter.\n\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\n\nResults:\nArea: 15.0\nPerimeter: 16.0\n```\n\nThis example calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units.",
