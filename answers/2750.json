  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates an object's acceleration given its initial and final velocities and time.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate an object's acceleration given its initial and final velocities and time.\n\n    Args:\n        initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.\n        final_velocity (float): The final velocity of the object in m/s.\n        time (float): The time over which the object accelerated in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    acceleration = (final_velocity - initial_velocity) / time\n    return acceleration\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    initial_velocity = 10  # m/s\n    final_velocity = 20    # m/s\n    time = 2               # seconds\n\n    acceleration = calculate_acceleration(initial_velocity, final_velocity, time)\n    print(f\"The acceleration of the object is {acceleration} m/s^2.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo use this program, simply call the `calculate_acceleration` function with the initial velocity, final velocity, and time as arguments. The function returns the acceleration of the object.\n\nNote that the formula used to calculate acceleration is:\n\na = \u0394v / \u0394t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, \u0394v is the change in velocity (final velocity - initial velocity), and \u0394t is the change in time. This formula is derived from the definition of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity.",
