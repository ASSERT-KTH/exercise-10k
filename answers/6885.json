  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a user's input and checks the data type of the input. If the input is an integer, it should print 'Integer'. If the input is a float, it should print 'Float'. If the input is a string, it should print 'String'.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef check_data_type(user_input):\n    try:\n        # Try to convert the input to an integer\n        int(user_input)\n        print('Integer')\n    except ValueError:\n        try:\n            # If it's not an integer, try to convert it to a float\n            float(user_input)\n            print('Float')\n        except ValueError:\n            # If it's neither an integer nor a float, it's a string\n            print('String')\n\ndef main():\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter your input: \")\n    check_data_type(user_input)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works by attempting to convert the user's input into different data types. If the conversion is successful, it prints the corresponding data type. If the conversion fails (which raises a `ValueError`), it tries the next data type.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `check_data_type` function takes in the user's input.\n2. It tries to convert the input to an integer using `int(user_input)`. If this is successful, it prints 'Integer'.\n3. If the conversion to an integer fails (which raises a `ValueError`), it tries to convert the input to a float using `float(user_input)`. If this is successful, it prints 'Float'.\n4. If the conversion to a float also fails, it prints 'String', since the input must be a string at this point.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user for input, calls the `check_data_type` function with the user's input, and starts the program.\n\nNote that this program considers any input that is not a number to be a string, which may not be what you want if you need to handle other data types (like lists or dictionaries). But for simple integer/float/string checking, this should work fine.",
