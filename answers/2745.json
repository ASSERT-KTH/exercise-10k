  "answer": "Quadratic Equation Solver\n==========================\n\nA quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, which means the highest power of the variable is two. It has the general form of:\n\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\nwhere a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable.\n\n### Code\n\nHere is a Python program that solves a quadratic equation given its coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_quadratic(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a quadratic equation given its coefficients.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The coefficient of the squared term.\n        b (float): The coefficient of the linear term.\n        c (float): The constant term.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the solutions to the equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    d = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n    # If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions\n    if d > 0:\n        sol1 = (-b - math.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        sol2 = (-b + math.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        return (sol1, sol2)\n\n    # If the discriminant is zero, there is one real solution\n    elif d == 0:\n        sol = -b / (2*a)\n        return (sol, sol)\n\n    # If the discriminant is negative, there are two complex solutions\n    else:\n        sol1 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        sol2 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)\n        return (sol1, sol2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    a = 1\n    b = -3\n    c = 2\n    solutions = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)\n\n    print(f\"The solutions to the equation {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c} = 0 are:\")\n    print(f\"x = {solutions[0]}\")\n    print(f\"x = {solutions[1]}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `solve_quadratic` function takes in the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of the quadratic equation.\n2. It calculates the discriminant `d` using the formula `b^2 - 4ac`.\n3. Depending on the value of the discriminant, it calculates the solutions to the equation.\n\t* If `d > 0`, there are two real solutions.\n\t* If `d == 0`, there is one real solution.\n\t* If `d < 0`, there are two complex solutions.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `solve_quadratic` function with an example quadratic equation.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle the case where the discriminant is negative, as this will result in complex solutions.\n* Use the `cmath` module to handle complex numbers in Python.\n* Consider adding error checking to handle cases where the input coefficients are not valid (e.g. `a` is zero).",
