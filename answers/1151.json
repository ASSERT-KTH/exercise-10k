  "answer": "**Assignment Grade Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their scores on several assignments. The program uses a weighted average formula to calculate the overall grade.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(assignments):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the overall grade based on assignment scores.\n\n    Args:\n        assignments (dict): A dictionary where keys are assignment names and values are dictionaries with 'score' and 'weight' keys.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The overall grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_score = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    for assignment, details in assignments.items():\n        score = details['score']\n        weight = details['weight']\n        total_score += score * weight\n        total_weight += weight\n\n    overall_grade = total_score / total_weight\n    return overall_grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    assignments = {\n        'Assignment 1': {'score': 90, 'weight': 0.2},\n        'Assignment 2': {'score': 85, 'weight': 0.3},\n        'Assignment 3': {'score': 95, 'weight': 0.5}\n    }\n\n    overall_grade = calculate_grade(assignments)\n    print(f\"Overall Grade: {overall_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a dictionary of assignments as input.\n2. Each assignment is represented by a dictionary with 'score' and 'weight' keys.\n3. The function calculates the weighted sum of scores and the total weight.\n4. The overall grade is calculated by dividing the weighted sum of scores by the total weight.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function with an example dictionary of assignments.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the overall grade for a student with multiple assignments.\n* Adjust the weights of assignments to reflect their relative importance.\n* Add or remove assignments from the dictionary to update the overall grade.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the scores are out of 100 and the weights are decimal values between 0 and 1.\n* The program does not handle invalid input (e.g., negative scores or weights). You may want to add error checking to handle such cases.",
