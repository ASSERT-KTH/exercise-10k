  "answer": "Here is a Python program that reads a list of numbers from the user, calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation, and prints out these statistics.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = np.mean(numbers)\n    median = np.median(numbers)\n    std_dev = np.std(numbers)\n\n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    # Read a list of numbers from the user\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a list of numbers (space-separated): \")\n    numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n\n    # Calculate the statistics\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    # Print out the statistics\n    print(\"Statistics:\")\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading User Input**: The program uses the built-in `input` function to read a line of text from the user. The input is expected to be a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n2. **Parsing the Input**: The input string is split into a list of strings using the `split` method. Each string is then converted to a float using a list comprehension.\n3. **Calculating Statistics**: The `calculate_statistics` function uses NumPy functions to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the list of numbers.\n4. **Printing Statistics**: The `main` function prints out the calculated statistics.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter a list of numbers (space-separated): 1 2 3 4 5\nStatistics:\nMean: 3.0\nMedian: 3.0\nStandard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter a valid list of numbers. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input.",
