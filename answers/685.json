  "answer": "**Power Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the result of a number raised to a power. It takes two inputs from the user: the base number and the exponent.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of a number raised to a power.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base number: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the result\n    result = calculate_power(base, exponent)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate 2 raised to the power of 3: Enter `2` as the base and `3` as the exponent. The result will be `8`.\n* Calculate 4 raised to the power of 2: Enter `4` as the base and `2` as the exponent. The result will be `16`.\n* Calculate 2.5 raised to the power of 1.5: Enter `2.5` as the base and `1.5` as the exponent. The result will be approximately `3.953`.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `power_calculator.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python power_calculator.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the base and exponent values.\n5. The program will display the result of the calculation.",
