  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between two players. The game rules are as follows:\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get user input\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        # Generate computer choice\n        choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Print choices\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n\n        # Determine winner\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        # Play again\n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will generate a random choice for the computer and print both choices.\n4. The program will determine the winner based on the game rules and print the result.\n5. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter \"yes\" to play again or \"no\" to exit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to generate the computer's choice. The game rules are implemented using conditional statements.",
