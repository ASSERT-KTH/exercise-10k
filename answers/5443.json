  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nHere is a simple program written in Python that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it asks the user for their guess.\n3. The program checks if the input is a valid integer. If not, it asks the user to try again.\n4. The program checks if the guess is correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.\n5. If the guess is not correct, the program provides a hint (e.g., \"Too low! Try a higher number.\") and asks the user to try again.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, simply copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter or save it to a file (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`) and run it using `python number_guessing_game.py`. The program will then prompt the user to guess the number.",
