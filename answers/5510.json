  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that implements the binary search algorithm to find a specific element in a sorted array:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a specific element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\ntarget = 23\n\nresult = binary_search(arr, target)\n\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n3.  Compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target element.\n    *   If they match, return the middle index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until the target element is found or the `low` pointer exceeds the `high` pointer.\n5.  If the target element is not found, return -1 to indicate that it's not present in the array.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because we divide the search space in half at each step.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the target element.",
