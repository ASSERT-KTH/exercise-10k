  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program simulates a game of rock paper scissors against the user. The user can play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"User\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer\"\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        \n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n        \n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == \"Tie\":\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{winner} wins!\")\n        \n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (y/n): \")\n        while play_again.lower() not in [\"y\", \"n\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter y for yes or n for no: \")\n\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to play another round or 'n' to quit.\n\nNote: This program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they choose to quit. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice, and the `determine_winner` function determines the winner of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.",
