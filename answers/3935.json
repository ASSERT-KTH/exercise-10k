  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the standard deviation of the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean of the numbers\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the variance of the numbers\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers\n    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n    return standard_deviation\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nstandard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\nprint(f\"The standard deviation of the numbers is: {standard_deviation}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_standard_deviation` that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the numbers, then the variance, and finally the standard deviation. The example usage at the end shows how to use this function with a list of numbers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `statistics` module in Python, which has a `stdev` function that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return statistics.stdev(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nstandard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\nprint(f\"The standard deviation of the numbers is: {standard_deviation}\")\n```\n\nThis version of the program is simpler and more efficient, as it uses the optimized `stdev` function from the `statistics` module.",
