  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Initialize a variable to store the sum\ntotal = 0\n\n# Loop through each number in the list\nfor number in numbers:\n    # Add the current number to the total\n    total += number\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = total / len(numbers)\n\n# Print the average\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\n\nHere's how this program works:\n\n1. We define a list of numbers.\n2. We initialize a variable called `total` to store the sum of all the numbers.\n3. We use a for loop to loop through each number in the list.\n4. Inside the loop, we add the current number to the `total`.\n5. After the loop finishes, we calculate the average by dividing the `total` by the number of elements in the list (which we get using `len(numbers)`).\n6. Finally, we print out the average.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe average is: 3.0\n```\n\nThis program assumes that the list of numbers is not empty. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average. To handle this, you could add a check before calculating the average:\n\n```python\nif len(numbers) == 0:\n    print(\"The list is empty\")\nelse:\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    print(\"The average is:\", average)\n```",
