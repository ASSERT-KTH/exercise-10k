  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should have two functions: one for calculating the area and one for calculating the perimeter. The rectangle's length and width should be provided as input to the program.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\ndef area(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef perimeter(length, width):\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return perimeter\n\nlength = int(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = int(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\nprint(\"The area of the rectangle is:\", area(length, width))\nprint(\"The perimeter of the rectangle is:\", perimeter(length, width))\n```\nThis code defines the `area` and `perimeter` functions, takes input for the length and width of the rectangle, and then calls these functions with the provided values to calculate and print the area and perimeter.",
