  "answer": "**Triangle Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the area\n    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n    print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the base of the triangle when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n3. Enter the height of the triangle when prompted (e.g., `6`).\n4. The program will print the area of the triangle (e.g., `The area of the triangle is: 15.00`).\n\n### Notes\n\n* The formula used to calculate the area of a triangle is `A = 0.5 * b * h`, where `A` is the area, `b` is the base, and `h` is the height.\n* The program uses a `calculate_triangle_area` function to encapsulate the calculation logic and make the code more modular and reusable.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output, and calls the `calculate_triangle_area` function to perform the calculation.",
