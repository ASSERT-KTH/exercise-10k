  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nHere is a simple number guessing game implemented using Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of guesses\n    num_guesses = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of guesses\n        num_guesses += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} guesses.\".format(num_guesses))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program reveals the correct answer and ends.\n4. If the user enters a valid number, the program checks if it's correct, too high, or too low, and provides feedback accordingly.\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* The user guesses the correct number on the first try.\n* The user guesses a number that's too high or too low, and the program provides feedback to help them narrow down the correct range.\n* The user types \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.",
