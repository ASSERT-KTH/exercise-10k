  "answer": "**Reversing Characters in Each Word of a Sentence**\n\nBelow is a Python program that accomplishes this task. It uses the built-in `input` function to get a sentence from the user, splits the sentence into words, reverses each word, and then joins them back together.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the order of characters in each word of a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence with each word's characters reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into words\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]  # Reverse each word\n    reversed_sentence = ' '.join(reversed_words)  # Join the reversed words back into a sentence\n    return reversed_sentence\n\ndef main():\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")\n    reversed_sentence = reverse_words_in_sentence(sentence)\n    print(\"Reversed sentence: \", reversed_sentence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `reverse_words_in_sentence` function takes a sentence as input and splits it into words using the `split` method.\n2. It then uses a list comprehension to reverse each word. The `[::-1]` slice means \"start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1\" which effectively reverses the string.\n3. The reversed words are then joined back together into a sentence using the `join` method.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a sentence, which is then passed to the `reverse_words_in_sentence` function.\n5. The reversed sentence is then printed to the console.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter a sentence. If you enter \"Hello World\", it will print \"olleH dlroW\".",
