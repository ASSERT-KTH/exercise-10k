  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a person's age as input and prints out a message indicating whether they are an adult or not.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef check_adult(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is an adult based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The person's age.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is an adult, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming adult age is 18 and above\n    adult_age = 18\n    return age >= adult_age\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the person's age from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    # Check if the person is an adult\n    if check_adult(age):\n        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not an adult.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `check_adult` that checks if a person is an adult based on their age. It then uses this function in the `main` function to get the person's age from the user and print out a message indicating whether they are an adult or not.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter your age when prompted. The program will then print out a message indicating whether you are an adult or not.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* If the user enters `25`, the program will print out `You are an adult.`\n* If the user enters `17`, the program will print out `You are not an adult.`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the adult age is 18 and above. If the adult age is different in your country or region, you can modify the `adult_age` variable in the `check_adult` function accordingly.",
