The function `is_subsequence` takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.\n2. It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through `s1` and `s2` respectively.\n3. If the current characters in `s1` and `s2` match, it moves the pointer `i` for `s1`.\n4. It always moves the pointer `j` for `s2`.\n5. If all characters in `s1` are iterated through (i.e., `i` reaches the end of `s1`), it returns `True`, indicating that `s1` is a subsequence of `s2`.\n6. Otherwise, it returns `False`.",
