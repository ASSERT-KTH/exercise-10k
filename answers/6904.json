  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The function should take the length and width of the rectangle as parameters and return the calculated area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n    return area, perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle\n    area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width)\n\n    # Print the calculated area and perimeter\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_rectangle_properties` that takes the length and width of the rectangle as parameters and returns the calculated area and perimeter.\n*   Inside the function, we calculate the area by multiplying the length and width, and the perimeter by multiplying the sum of the length and width by 2.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, call the `calculate_rectangle_properties` function with these values, and then print the calculated area and perimeter.\n*   We use the `float` function to convert the user's input into floating-point numbers, allowing for decimal values.\n*   We use f-strings to format the output with two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter the length and width of a rectangle to calculate its area and perimeter.\n*   Use the `calculate_rectangle_properties` function in other programs or scripts to calculate rectangle properties without having to duplicate the calculation logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_rectangle_properties` that takes the length and width of the rectangle as parameters.\n2.  Calculate the area by multiplying the length and width, and the perimeter by multiplying the sum of the length and width by 2.\n3.  Return the calculated area and perimeter as a tuple.\n4.  Create a `main` function to get the length and width of the rectangle from the user, call the `calculate_rectangle_properties` function, and print the calculated area and perimeter.\n5.  Use the `float` function to convert the user's input into floating-point numbers, and f-strings to format the output with two decimal places.",
