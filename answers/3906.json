  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x, y)\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x, y)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\n3. The `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the distance between two points on a map\n* Determine the distance between two objects in a game or simulation\n* Measure the distance between two points in a geometric shape\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). The program will output the distance between the example points. You can modify the `point1` and `point2` variables in the `main` function to test the program with different points.",
