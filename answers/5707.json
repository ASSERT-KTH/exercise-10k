  "answer": "**Calculating Age Based on Birth Year and Current Year**\n\nTo calculate a person's age, you can use the following formula:\n\n### Formula\n\nAge = Current Year - Birth Year\n\n### Example\n\n* Birth Year: 1990\n* Current Year: 2024\n* Age = 2024 - 1990 = 34\n\n### Code Implementation (Python)\n\n```python\ndef calculate_age(birth_year, current_year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a person's age based on their birth year and the current year.\n\n    Args:\n        birth_year (int): The person's birth year.\n        current_year (int): The current year.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The person's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    age = current_year - birth_year\n    return age\n\n# Example usage\nbirth_year = 1990\ncurrent_year = 2024\nage = calculate_age(birth_year, current_year)\nprint(f\"Age: {age}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_age` that takes two arguments: `birth_year` and `current_year`.\n2. Calculate the age by subtracting the `birth_year` from the `current_year`.\n3. Return the calculated age.\n4. Use the function by passing the desired `birth_year` and `current_year` as arguments.\n\nNote: This calculation assumes that the person has already had their birthday in the current year. If the person's birthday is later in the year, you may need to adjust the calculation accordingly.",
