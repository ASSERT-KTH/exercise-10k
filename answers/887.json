  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given password meets the following conditions:\n\n* At least 8 characters long\n* Contains at least one uppercase letter\n* Contains at least one lowercase letter\n* Contains at least one digit\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the given conditions.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for a password\n    password = input(\"Please enter a password: \")\n\n    # Validate the password\n    if validate_password(password):\n        print(\"The password is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following conditions:\")\n        print(\"* At least 8 characters long\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one digit\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a password when prompted.\n3. The program will print a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Use a secure method to store passwords, such as hashing and salting.\n* Consider adding additional password requirements, such as special characters or a minimum number of unique characters.\n* Use a library or framework that provides built-in password validation and security features.",
