  "answer": "Here is an example program in C that demonstrates the difference between static and dynamic memory allocation:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Function to demonstrate static memory allocation\nvoid staticMemoryAllocation() {\n    int arr[5];  // Static memory allocation\n\n    // Assign values to the array\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        arr[i] = i * 10;\n    }\n\n    // Print the array\n    printf(\"Static Memory Allocation:\\n\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\n// Function to demonstrate dynamic memory allocation\nvoid dynamicMemoryAllocation() {\n    int* arr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));  // Dynamic memory allocation\n\n    // Check if memory allocation was successful\n    if (arr == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Memory allocation failed\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Assign values to the array\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        arr[i] = i * 10;\n    }\n\n    // Print the array\n    printf(\"Dynamic Memory Allocation:\\n\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    // Free the allocated memory\n    free(arr);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    staticMemoryAllocation();\n    dynamicMemoryAllocation();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Static Memory Allocation:**\n    *   In the `staticMemoryAllocation` function, we declare an integer array `arr` with a fixed size of 5.\n    *   The memory for this array is allocated at compile-time, and it is stored on the stack.\n    *   The size of the array is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime.\n    *   Once the function returns, the memory allocated for the array is automatically deallocated.\n2.  **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**\n    *   In the `dynamicMemoryAllocation` function, we use the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory for an integer array of size 5.\n    *   The memory is allocated at runtime, and it is stored on the heap.\n    *   The size of the array can be changed at runtime by allocating a different amount of memory.\n    *   We need to manually deallocate the memory using the `free` function to prevent memory leaks.\n3.  **Key Differences:**\n    *   **Memory Allocation Time:** Static memory allocation occurs at compile-time, while dynamic memory allocation occurs at runtime.\n    *   **Memory Location:** Static memory allocation stores data on the stack, while dynamic memory allocation stores data on the heap.\n    *   **Memory Deallocation:** Static memory allocation automatically deallocates memory when the function returns, while dynamic memory allocation requires manual deallocation using `free`.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Dynamic memory allocation provides more flexibility in terms of memory size and allocation, but it also requires more manual management to avoid memory leaks.",
