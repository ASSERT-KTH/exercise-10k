  "answer": "**Getting User Input in Python**\n\nYou can use the built-in `input()` function in Python to get user input and store it in a variable. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n# Get user input and store it in a variable\nuser_input = input(\"Please enter something: \")\n\n# Print the user input\nprint(\"You entered:\", user_input)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `input()` function is called with a prompt string (\"Please enter something: \").\n2. The user is prompted to enter something, and their input is stored in the `user_input` variable.\n3. The `print()` function is used to display the user's input.\n\n**Note:** In Python 2.x, you would use `raw_input()` instead of `input()`. However, in Python 3.x, `input()` is the correct function to use.",
