  "answer": "**Symmetric Matrix Checker**\n==========================\n\nA symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its own transpose. This program checks if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the matrix is equal to its transpose\n    return np.allclose(matrix, matrix.T)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a symmetric matrix\n    symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]])\n\n    # Define a non-symmetric matrix\n    non_symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n\n    print(\"Is symmetric_matrix symmetric?\", is_symmetric(symmetric_matrix))\n    print(\"Is non_symmetric_matrix symmetric?\", is_symmetric(non_symmetric_matrix))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `is_symmetric` function takes a numpy array `matrix` as input.\n2. It first checks if the matrix is square by comparing its number of rows and columns. If it's not square, the function returns `False`.\n3. If the matrix is square, it checks if the matrix is equal to its transpose using `np.allclose`. This function returns `True` if the two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.\n4. The example usage demonstrates the function with a symmetric and a non-symmetric matrix.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* This program uses the `numpy` library for matrix operations.\n* The `np.allclose` function is used to compare the matrix and its transpose due to floating-point precision issues. If you're working with integer matrices, you can use the `==` operator instead.",
