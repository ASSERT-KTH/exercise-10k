  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and asks the user to guess it. If the user's guess is incorrect, it provides a hint, such as 'too high' or 'too low'.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n            if 1 <= guess <= 10:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\ndef get_hint(guess, target):\n    \"\"\"Provide a hint based on the user's guess.\"\"\"\n    if guess < target:\n        return \"too low\"\n    elif guess > target:\n        return \"too high\"\n    else:\n        return \"correct\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    target = random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    while True:\n        # Get the user's guess\n        guess = get_user_guess()\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Get the hint\n        hint = get_hint(guess, target)\n        \n        # Print the hint\n        if hint == \"correct\":\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(f\"Your guess is {hint}. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a guess when prompted.\n3. If your guess is incorrect, the program will provide a hint.\n4. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n\nNote: This program will continue to run until you correctly guess the number. If you want to limit the number of attempts, you can modify the program to include a maximum number of attempts.",
