  "answer": "**Checking for Prime Numbers using a While Loop**\n=====================================================\n\nHere's an example of how you can use a while loop to check if a given number is prime in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  We define a function `is_prime(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2.  We first check if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, we return `False`, as these numbers are not prime.\n3.  We initialize a variable `i` to 2, which will be used to check for factors of `n`.\n4.  We use a while loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n5.  Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by `i` by using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`). If `n` is divisible, we return `False`, as it's not a prime number.\n6.  If the loop completes without finding any factors, we return `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), as we're only checking up to the square root of `n`. This makes it more efficient for larger numbers compared to checking all the way up to `n`.",
