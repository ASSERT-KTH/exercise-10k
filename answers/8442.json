  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a price and calculates the corresponding discount using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that calculates discounts based on the price:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the discount\ndef calculate_discount(price):\n    # Initialize the discount rate\n    discount_rate = 0\n\n    # Check the price and apply the corresponding discount rate\n    if price < 10:\n        discount_rate = 0\n    elif price >= 10 and price < 20:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    elif price >= 20 and price < 50:\n        discount_rate = 0.10\n    elif price >= 50 and price < 100:\n        discount_rate = 0.15\n    elif price >= 100:\n        discount_rate = 0.20\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = price * discount_rate\n\n    # Calculate the price after discount\n    price_after_discount = price - discount_amount\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Original Price: ${price:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Rate: {discount_rate*100}%\")\n    print(f\"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Price after Discount: ${price_after_discount:.2f}\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the price from the user\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the discount\n    calculate_discount(price)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_discount` function takes in a `price` and calculates the corresponding discount based on the conditional statements.\n2. **Conditional Statements**: The function uses `if-elif-else` statements to check the price and apply the corresponding discount rate.\n3. **Discount Calculation**: The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the price with the discount rate.\n4. **Price after Discount**: The price after discount is calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.\n5. **Main Function**: The `main` function gets the price from the user and calls the `calculate_discount` function to calculate the discount.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a price of $15, the program will apply a discount rate of 5% and calculate the discount amount and price after discount.\n* If the user enters a price of $75, the program will apply a discount rate of 15% and calculate the discount amount and price after discount.\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the conditional statements to change the discount rates and thresholds.\n* You can also add more features, such as calculating tax or handling different types of discounts.\n* Make sure to test the program with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.",
