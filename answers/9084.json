  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and replaces all occurrences of a specified element with a new element. The program should accept four parameters: the array, the element to replace, the new element, and the maximum number of replacements allowed. If the maximum number of replacements is reached, the program should stop replacing elements even if there are more occurrences of the element to replace.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\ndef replace_elements(array, element, new_element, max_replacements):\n    new_array = array[:]\n    replacements = 0\n\n    for i, val in enumerate(new_array):\n        if val == element and replacements < max_replacements:\n            new_array[i] = new_element\n            replacements += 1\n\n    return new_array\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\nelement = 2\nnew_element = 10\nmax_replacements = 2\n\nresult = replace_elements(array, element, new_element, max_replacements)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code defines the `replace_elements` function, which takes an array, an element to replace, a new element, and a maximum number of replacements as input. It initializes a new array `new_array` by copying the original array, and a `replacements` counter to keep track of the number of replacements made.\n\nThe function then iterates over the `new_array` using a for loop with the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `val` of each element. If the current element `val` is equal to the element to replace `element`, and the `replacements` counter is less than the maximum number of replacements `max_replacements`, the function replaces the current element with the new element `new_element` and increments the `replacements` counter.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified `new_array`. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `replace_elements` function with a sample array and print the result.",
