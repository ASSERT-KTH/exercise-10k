  "answer": "Here's a Python program to insert a new element into a given list at a specific position:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_position(lst, new_element, position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts a new element into the list at the specified position.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    lst (list): The input list.\n    new_element: The element to be inserted.\n    position (int): The position at which the element is to be inserted.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: The updated list with the new element inserted.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the position is within the list bounds\n    if position < 0 or position > len(lst):\n        raise IndexError(\"Position out of range\")\n    \n    # Insert the new element at the specified position\n    lst.insert(position, new_element)\n    \n    return lst\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]\nnew_number = 4\nposition = 3\n\nupdated_numbers = insert_at_position(numbers, new_number, position)\nprint(updated_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `insert_at_position` takes three parameters: `lst` (the input list), `new_element` (the element to be inserted), and `position` (the position at which the element is to be inserted).\n2.  It checks if the specified position is within the list bounds (i.e., between 0 and the length of the list). If the position is out of range, it raises an `IndexError`.\n3.  If the position is valid, it uses the `insert` method of the list to insert the `new_element` at the specified `position`.\n4.  Finally, it returns the updated list with the new element inserted.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the `insert` method in Python lists involves shifting all elements after the insertion point, which takes linear time.",
