  "answer": "**Reversing Words in a String**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string as input, splits it into words, reverses each word, and then joins them back together with spaces in between.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses each word in a given string and joins them back together with spaces.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to be processed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with words reversed and separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Reverse each word\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n\n    # Join the reversed words back together with spaces\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n\n    return reversed_string\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello World\"\n    print(reverse_words(input_string))  # Output: \"olleH dlroW\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of words.\n2. A list comprehension is used to reverse each word in the list. The `[::-1]` slice notation is used to reverse each word.\n3. The `join()` method is used to join the reversed words back together with spaces in between.\n4. The resulting string is returned by the function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Reversing words in a sentence: `reverse_words(\"Hello World\")` returns `\"olleH dlroW\"`\n* Reversing words in a phrase: `reverse_words(\"This is a test\")` returns `\"sihT si a tset\"`",
