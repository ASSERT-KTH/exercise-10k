Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    if (user_choice == \"Rock\" and computer_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Paper\" and computer_choice == \"Rock\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"Scissors\" and computer_choice == \"Paper\"):\n        return \"User\"\n    return \"Computer\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    if winner == \"Tie\":\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The {winner} wins!\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to play the game\"\"\"\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2.
