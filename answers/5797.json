  "answer": "### Sum of Squares Function\n#### Overview\nThis function calculates the sum of the squares of a list of numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of the squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([n ** 2 for n in numbers])\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = sum_of_squares(numbers)\n    print(f\"The sum of the squares of {numbers} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n* The function `sum_of_squares` takes a list of numbers as input.\n* It uses a list comprehension to square each number in the list (`n ** 2`).\n* The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of these squared numbers.\n* The result is returned by the function.\n* In the `main` function, an example list of numbers is provided, and the `sum_of_squares` function is called with this list.\n* The result is then printed to the console.",
