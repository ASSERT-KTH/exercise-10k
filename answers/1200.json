  "answer": "**Word Length Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a word as input from the user and prints out its length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_word_length(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the length of the input word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The input word.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the word.\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(word)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n\n    # Calculate and print word length\n    word_length = get_word_length(word)\n    print(f\"The length of '{word}' is {word_length}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a word when prompted (e.g., \"hello\").\n3. The program will print out the length of the word (e.g., \"The length of 'hello' is 5.\").\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_word_length` function takes a word as input and returns its length using the built-in `len` function.\n2. The `main` function gets user input, calculates the word length using `get_word_length`, and prints out the result.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.",
