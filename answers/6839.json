  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The program should use a basic algorithm to iterate through the array and find the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a[] = {2, 4, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7};\n    int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);\n    int max = a[0];\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] > max) {\n            max = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Maximum value in the array is: \" << max << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps described in the specification:\n\n1. It includes the necessary header file (`<iostream>`) and uses the `std` namespace.\n2. It defines an array `a` containing 9 integers and calculates the size of the array `n` using the `sizeof` operator.\n3. It initializes the `max` variable to the first element of the array `a[0]`.\n4. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`) and ending at the last element (`i < n`).\n5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `a[i]` is greater than the current `max` value. If it is, it updates the `max` variable to the current element's value.\n6. After the loop, it prints the maximum value found in the array to the console using `cout`.\n7. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the array is non-empty. If the array might be empty, additional error handling would be necessary.",
