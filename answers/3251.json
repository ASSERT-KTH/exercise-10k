  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates an arithmetic sequence given the first term, common difference, and number of terms:\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an arithmetic sequence given the first term, common difference, and number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_difference (float): The difference between each term in the sequence.\n        num_terms (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of floats representing the arithmetic sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for i in range(num_terms):\n        term = first_term + (i * common_difference)\n        sequence.append(term)\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    first_term = float(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_difference = float(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)\n    print(\"Arithmetic Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function takes three arguments: `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `num_terms`.\n2. It initializes an empty list `sequence` to store the terms of the arithmetic sequence.\n3. It uses a `for` loop to generate each term in the sequence, starting from the `first_term` and adding the `common_difference` for each subsequent term.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to input the `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `num_terms`, and then calls the `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function to generate the sequence.\n5. Finally, it prints the generated arithmetic sequence.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf the user inputs the following values:\n\n* First term: 2\n* Common difference: 3\n* Number of terms: 5\n\nThe program will output the following arithmetic sequence:\n\n```\nArithmetic Sequence:\n[2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 14.0]\n```\n\nThis sequence starts with the first term 2, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the common difference 3.",
