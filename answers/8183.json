  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n```\nimport random\n\n# Generate a random number between 1 and 100\nnumber_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n# Initialize the number of attempts\nattempts = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    # Ask the user for their guess\n    user_guess = input(\"Guess the number (or 'q' to quit): \")\n\n    # Check if the user wants to quit\n    if user_guess.lower() == 'q':\n        print(\"Okay, goodbye!\")\n        break\n\n    # Convert the user's guess to an integer\n    try:\n        user_guess = int(user_guess)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a whole number.\")\n        continue\n\n    # Check if the user's guess is valid\n    if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n        continue\n\n    # Increment the number of attempts\n    attempts += 1\n\n    # Check if the user's guess is correct\n    if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n        print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n        break\n    elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n        print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n```\nThis program meets all the requirements specified:\n\n* It generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint()` function.\n* It uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they guess the number correctly or choose to quit.\n* It asks the user for their guess using the `input()` function and checks if the user wants to quit by checking if the input is `'q'`.\n* It converts the user's guess to an integer using the `int()` function and checks if the input is a valid whole number.\n* It checks if the user's guess is within the valid range of 1 to 100 and prints an error message if it's not.\n* It increments the number of attempts each time the user makes a guess and prints the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.\n* It checks if the user's guess is correct and prints a congratulatory message if it is. If not, it provides a hint to help the user guess the correct number.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g. `guessing_game.py`) and run it using Python (e.g. `python guessing_game.py`) to play the game.",
