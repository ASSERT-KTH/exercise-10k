  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers. It uses Python as the programming language and includes a `main` function for example usage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport statistics\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mean(num_list):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(num_list) / len(num_list)\n\ndef calculate_median(num_list):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return statistics.median(num_list)\n\ndef calculate_mode(num_list):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(num_list)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    modes = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(num_list)\n    median = calculate_median(num_list)\n    mode = calculate_mode(num_list)\n    \n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n    print(\"Mode:\", mode)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses the following functions:\n\n*   `calculate_mean(num_list)`: Calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all numbers and dividing by the list length.\n*   `calculate_median(num_list)`: Uses the `statistics.median()` function to calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n*   `calculate_mode(num_list)`: Calculates the mode of a list of numbers by counting the occurrences of each number and returning the numbers with the highest count.\n*   `main()`: Demonstrates example usage of the above functions.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `stats_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python stats_calculator.py`). The program will output the mean, median, and mode of the example list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the program, it will display the calculated mean, median, and mode of the example list. For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`, the output will be:\n\n```\nMean: 3.5\nMedian: 4\nMode: [5]\n```",
