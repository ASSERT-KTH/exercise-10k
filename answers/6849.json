  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operations to be supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Supported operations are 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', and 'division'\")\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): \")\n    \n    try:\n        result = perform_arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation} is {result}\")\n    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Function definition**: The `perform_arithmetic_operation` function takes three arguments: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`. It checks the `operation` argument and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on `num1` and `num2`.\n2. **Error handling**: The function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the user attempts to divide by zero. It also raises a `ValueError` if the user enters an unsupported operation.\n3. **Main function**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation. It then calls the `perform_arithmetic_operation` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n4. **Error handling in main**: The `main` function catches any `ZeroDivisionError` or `ValueError` exceptions raised by the `perform_arithmetic_operation` function and prints the error message.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n* Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `addition` as the operation to get a result of `15.0`.\n* Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `division` as the operation to get a result of `2.0`.\n* Enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `division` as the operation to see an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.\n* Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `modulus` as the operation to see an error message indicating that the operation is not supported.",
