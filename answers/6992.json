  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of Three Numbers**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of three input numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of three numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The first number.\n        b (float): The second number.\n        c (float): The third number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the three numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a + b + c) / 3\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the three numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the average\n    average = calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The average of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {average:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes three numbers as input, adds them together, and divides by 3 to calculate their average.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter three numbers, calls the `calculate_average` function with these numbers, and prints the result.\n3. The `:.2f` in the print statement formats the average to display two decimal places.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter three numbers. After entering the numbers, it will display their average. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 20\nEnter the third number: 30\nThe average of 10.0, 20.0, and 30.0 is 20.00\n```",
