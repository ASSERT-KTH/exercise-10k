  "answer": "**Word Scrambler Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes a word as input and scrambles its letters.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles the letters of a given word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to be scrambled.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the word to a list of characters\n    word_list = list(word)\n    \n    # Shuffle the list of characters\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters back into a string\n    scrambled_word = ''.join(word_list)\n    \n    return scrambled_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the word from the user\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    \n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    \n    # Print the scrambled word\n    print(\"Scrambled word: \", scrambled_word)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it to a list of characters.\n2. The `random.shuffle` function is used to shuffle the list of characters.\n3. The shuffled list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `join` method.\n4. The `main` function gets a word from the user, scrambles it using the `scramble_word` function, and prints the scrambled word.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter a word when prompted. The program will then print out the scrambled version of the word.\n\n```\nEnter a word: hello\nScrambled word:  olleh\n```",
