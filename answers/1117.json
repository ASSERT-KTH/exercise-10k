  "answer": "**Employee Salary Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the salary of an employee given their basic salary, allowances, and deductions.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, basic_salary):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize an Employee object.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): Employee name\n            basic_salary (float): Basic salary\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.basic_salary = basic_salary\n        self.allowances = {}\n        self.deductions = {}\n\n    def add_allowance(self, name, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add an allowance to the employee's salary.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): Allowance name\n            amount (float): Allowance amount\n        \"\"\"\n        self.allowances[name] = amount\n\n    def add_deduction(self, name, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add a deduction to the employee's salary.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): Deduction name\n            amount (float): Deduction amount\n        \"\"\"\n        self.deductions[name] = amount\n\n    def calculate_salary(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the employee's salary.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Employee's salary\n        \"\"\"\n        total_allowances = sum(self.allowances.values())\n        total_deductions = sum(self.deductions.values())\n        salary = self.basic_salary + total_allowances - total_deductions\n        return salary\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create an Employee object\n    employee = Employee(\"John Doe\", 50000)\n\n    # Add allowances\n    employee.add_allowance(\"Housing Allowance\", 10000)\n    employee.add_allowance(\"Transportation Allowance\", 5000)\n\n    # Add deductions\n    employee.add_deduction(\"Tax Deduction\", 5000)\n    employee.add_deduction(\"Insurance Deduction\", 2000)\n\n    # Calculate and print the employee's salary\n    salary = employee.calculate_salary()\n    print(f\"Employee Name: {employee.name}\")\n    print(f\"Basic Salary: {employee.basic_salary}\")\n    print(\"Allowances:\")\n    for name, amount in employee.allowances.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}: {amount}\")\n    print(\"Deductions:\")\n    for name, amount in employee.deductions.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}: {amount}\")\n    print(f\"Total Salary: {salary}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIn the `main` function, we create an `Employee` object named \"John Doe\" with a basic salary of 50000. We then add two allowances (Housing Allowance and Transportation Allowance) and two deductions (Tax Deduction and Insurance Deduction). Finally, we calculate and print the employee's salary.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nEmployee Name: John Doe\nBasic Salary: 50000\nAllowances:\n  - Housing Allowance: 10000\n  - Transportation Allowance: 5000\nDeductions:\n  - Tax Deduction: 5000\n  - Insurance Deduction: 2000\nTotal Salary: 60000\n```\n\nThis program provides a simple and flexible way to calculate an employee's salary based on their basic salary, allowances, and deductions. You can modify the `Employee` class to include additional features, such as calculating tax or insurance premiums, or adding more types of allowances and deductions.",
