  "answer": "### First Non-Repeating Character Function\n#### Overview\nThis function takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character in the string. If no such character exists, it returns `None`.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n\n    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbc\"))  # Output: c\n    print(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string.\n2. We iterate over the string, checking each character's count. If a character has a count of 1, it's the first non-repeating character, and we return it.\n3. If we finish iterating over the string without finding a non-repeating character, we return `None`.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we make a single pass over the string to count the characters and another pass to find the first non-repeating character. The `Counter` class also has a linear time complexity.",
