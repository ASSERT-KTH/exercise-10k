  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that utilizes a docstring and type hints to document its behavior and specify the types of its arguments and return value. This will enhance the clarity and usability of your code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a greeting message for the given name.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name to include in the greeting.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A greeting message including the given name.\n    \"\"\"\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `greet` is defined with a type hint `name: str` to indicate that it expects a string argument, and `-> str` to specify that it returns a string value.\n* A docstring is included within the function to provide a description of its behavior, explain the purpose of the `name` argument, and describe the returned greeting message.\n* The function uses an f-string to format the greeting message, incorporating the provided `name` into the output string.\n* The code includes a test case, `print(greet(\"John\"))`, to demonstrate the function's usage and verify its correctness.",
