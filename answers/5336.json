  "answer": "### Declaration and Printing of a 5x5 Square\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that declares a character variable with the value '*' and prints a 5x5 square using the character.\n\n```python\ndef print_square(size, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a square of a given size using a specified character.\n\n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the square.\n        char (str): The character to use when printing the square.\n    \"\"\"\n    for _ in range(size):\n        print(char * size)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Declare a character variable with the value '*'\n    char = '*'\n    size = 5\n\n    # Print a 5x5 square using the character\n    print_square(size, char)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `print_square` function takes two parameters: `size` and `char`.\n*   It uses a for loop to iterate `size` times, printing a string of `char` repeated `size` times on each iteration.\n*   In the `main` function, we declare the character variable `char` with the value '*'.\n*   We then call the `print_square` function with a size of 5 and the specified character.",
