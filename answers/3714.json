  "answer": "### Least Common Multiple Function\n#### Description\nThis function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two input numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_lcm(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num1 (int): The first number.\n    num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The least common multiple of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of num1 and num2\n    def calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    return lcm\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input.\n2. It defines a nested function `calculate_gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num1` and `num2` using the Euclidean algorithm.\n3. The LCM is then calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n4. The result is returned as an integer.\n5. In the example usage, we calculate the LCM of 12 and 15 and print the result.",
