  "answer": "**Linear Simultaneous Equations Solver**\n======================================\n\nThis program uses the NumPy library to solve a system of linear simultaneous equations. It takes the coefficients of the variables and the constants as input and returns the values of the variables.\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_linear_equations(coefficients, constants):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a system of linear simultaneous equations.\n\n    Args:\n    coefficients (list of lists): Coefficients of the variables.\n    constants (list): Constants on the right-hand side of the equations.\n\n    Returns:\n    solution (list): Values of the variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the coefficients and constants to NumPy arrays\n    coefficients = np.array(coefficients)\n    constants = np.array(constants)\n\n    # Use NumPy's linalg.solve function to solve the system of equations\n    solution = np.linalg.solve(coefficients, constants)\n\n    return solution\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define the coefficients of the variables\n    coefficients = [[3, 1], [1, 2]]\n\n    # Define the constants on the right-hand side of the equations\n    constants = [9, 8]\n\n    # Solve the system of linear equations\n    solution = solve_linear_equations(coefficients, constants)\n\n    # Print the solution\n    print(\"Solution:\")\n    for i, value in enumerate(solution):\n        print(f\"x{i+1} = {value}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `solve_linear_equations` function takes two arguments: `coefficients` and `constants`.\n2. The `coefficients` argument is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the coefficients of the variables in an equation.\n3. The `constants` argument is a list, where each element represents the constant on the right-hand side of an equation.\n4. The function converts the `coefficients` and `constants` to NumPy arrays using `np.array`.\n5. The function uses NumPy's `linalg.solve` function to solve the system of linear equations.\n6. The solution is returned as a list, where each element represents the value of a variable.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n------------------\n\nSuppose we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\nx + 2y = 6\n\nWe can represent the coefficients and constants as follows:\n\ncoefficients = [[2, 3], [1, 2]]\nconstants = [7, 6]\n\nWe can then call the `solve_linear_equations` function to solve the system of equations:\n\nsolution = solve_linear_equations(coefficients, constants)\n\nThe function will return the values of x and y that satisfy the equations.",
