  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that calculates the area of different shapes using conditional statements.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_area(shape):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a shape.\n\n    Args:\n    shape (dict): A dictionary containing the shape type and its dimensions.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the shape.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the shape type is valid\n    if 'type' not in shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Shape type is required\")\n\n    # Calculate the area based on the shape type\n    if shape['type'] == 'circle':\n        # Check if the radius is provided\n        if 'radius' not in shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Radius is required for a circle\")\n        # Calculate the area of the circle\n        area = math.pi * (shape['radius'] ** 2)\n    elif shape['type'] == 'rectangle':\n        # Check if the length and width are provided\n        if 'length' not in shape or 'width' not in shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Length and width are required for a rectangle\")\n        # Calculate the area of the rectangle\n        area = shape['length'] * shape['width']\n    elif shape['type'] == 'triangle':\n        # Check if the base and height are provided\n        if 'base' not in shape or 'height' not in shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Base and height are required for a triangle\")\n        # Calculate the area of the triangle\n        area = 0.5 * shape['base'] * shape['height']\n    elif shape['type'] == 'square':\n        # Check if the side length is provided\n        if 'side' not in shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Side length is required for a square\")\n        # Calculate the area of the square\n        area = shape['side'] ** 2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid shape type\")\n\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    circle = {'type': 'circle', 'radius': 5}\n    rectangle = {'type': 'rectangle', 'length': 4, 'width': 6}\n    triangle = {'type': 'triangle', 'base': 3, 'height': 7}\n    square = {'type': 'square', 'side': 4}\n\n    print(f\"Circle area: {calculate_area(circle)}\")\n    print(f\"Rectangle area: {calculate_area(rectangle)}\")\n    print(f\"Triangle area: {calculate_area(triangle)}\")\n    print(f\"Square area: {calculate_area(square)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_area` that takes a dictionary representing a shape and calculates its area based on the shape type. The shape dictionary must contain a 'type' key and the corresponding dimensions for the shape. The function uses conditional statements to determine which area formula to use based on the shape type.\n\nIn the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_area` function with different shapes. The program prints the calculated areas for each shape.\n\nNote: This program uses the math library for the pi constant and raises ValueError exceptions for invalid shape types or missing dimensions.",
