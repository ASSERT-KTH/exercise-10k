  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to create a function that takes a list of lists and a mapping function as input and returns a new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list. This solution aims to provide a clear, step-by-step approach to achieve the desired outcome. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef map_and_flatten(list_of_lists, mapping_function):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists and a mapping function as input, \n    applies the mapping function to each element in the sublists, \n    and returns a new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list.\n\n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list containing sublists.\n        mapping_function (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with all elements mapped and flattened into a single list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the mapped and flattened elements\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Iterate over each element in the current sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # Apply the mapping function to the current element and append the result to the result list\n            result.append(mapping_function(element))\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\ndouble_numbers = map_and_flatten(numbers, lambda x: x * 2)\nprint(double_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `map_and_flatten` function initializes an empty list `result` to store the mapped and flattened elements. It then iterates over each sublist in the `list_of_lists` using a nested loop structure.\n*   Within the inner loop, the function applies the provided `mapping_function` to each element in the sublists and appends the result to the `result` list.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all elements from the original list of lists, transformed by the mapping function and flattened into a single list.\n*   An example usage demonstrates the function's functionality by doubling numbers in a list of lists using a lambda function as the mapping function.",
