  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a for loop to analyze the grades of students and calculate the average grade:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with student names and their grades\nstudent_grades = {\n    \"John\": [85, 90, 78, 92],\n    \"Alice\": [88, 95, 85, 90],\n    \"Bob\": [76, 82, 90, 88],\n    \"Eve\": [92, 98, 89, 85],\n}\n\ndef calculate_average_grade(student_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student.\n\n    Args:\n        student_grades (dict): A dictionary with student names and their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with student names and their average grades.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the dictionary\n    for student, grades in student_grades.items():\n        # Calculate the sum of grades\n        total_grades = sum(grades)\n        \n        # Calculate the average grade\n        average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)\n\n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    return average_grades\n\ndef main():\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grade(student_grades)\n\n    # Print the average grades for each student\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        print(f\"Student: {student}, Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. We define a dictionary `student_grades` with student names and their grades.\n2. We define a function `calculate_average_grade` that takes the `student_grades` dictionary as input.\n3. Inside the `calculate_average_grade` function, we iterate over each student in the dictionary using a for loop.\n4. For each student, we calculate the sum of their grades using the `sum` function.\n5. We then calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades.\n6. We store the average grade in a new dictionary `average_grades`.\n7. In the `main` function, we call the `calculate_average_grade` function and store the result in the `average_grades` dictionary.\n8. We then print the average grades for each student using a for loop.\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nStudent: John, Average Grade: 86.25\nStudent: Alice, Average Grade: 89.50\nStudent: Bob, Average Grade: 84.00\nStudent: Eve, Average Grade: 91.00\n```",
