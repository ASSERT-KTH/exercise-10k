  "answer": "### Removing Duplicates from a List\n\nHere's an example of a function that removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to remove duplicates from.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in input_list if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6]\n    print(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n    print(\"List without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(my_list))\n```\n\nThis function uses a set to keep track of elements it has seen so far. It iterates over the input list and includes an element in the output list only if it has not been seen before. The `or seen.add(x)` part is a clever trick to add the element to the set and return `True` if the element was not in the set, and `False` otherwise.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal list: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6]\nList without duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, making it efficient for large lists. However, it does not modify the original list, but instead returns a new list with duplicates removed. If you need to modify the original list, you can assign the result back to the original list variable.",
