  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer as input and prints out the sum of all numbers from 1 to the input number using a for loop. Then, use a while loop to print out the sum of all numbers from the input number down to 1.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef sum(input_num):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, input_num + 1):\n        total += i\n    print(total)\n\ndef sum2(input_num):\n    total = 0\n    i = input_num\n    while i != 0:\n        total += i\n        i -= 1\n    print(total)\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nsum(num)\nsum2(num)\n```\nThis code defines the two functions `sum` and `sum2`, which calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to the input number and from the input number to 1, respectively. It then prompts the user to enter a number, converts the input to an integer, and calls the two functions with the input number.",
