  "prompt": "You are given a dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values. Your task is to write a program that calculates the average grade for each student across all subjects and then finds the student with the highest average grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses dictionaries to store student grades and calculates the average grade for each student:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student across all subjects.\n\n    Args:\n    students (dict): A dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the dictionary\n    for student, grades in students.items():\n        # Calculate the average grade for the current student\n        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n\n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    return average_grades\n\n\ndef find_top_student(average_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the student with the highest average grade.\n\n    Args:\n    average_grades (dict): A dictionary containing student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The name of the student with the highest average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use the max function with a key argument to find the student with the highest average grade\n    top_student = max(average_grades, key=average_grades.get)\n\n    return top_student\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define a dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values\n    students = {\n        \"John\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 90, \"English\": 78},\n        \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 92, \"Science\": 88, \"English\": 95},\n        \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 78, \"Science\": 85, \"English\": 90},\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the average grade for each student\n    average_grades = calculate_average_grade(students)\n\n    # Find the student with the highest average grade\n    top_student = find_top_student(average_grades)\n\n    # Print the average grades for each student\n    print(\"Average Grades:\")\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        print(f\"{student}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n    # Print the student with the highest average grade\n    print(f\"\\nThe student with the highest average grade is {top_student} with an average grade of {average_grades[top_student]:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis solution consists of three main functions:\n\n1.  `calculate_average_grade`: This function calculates the average grade for each student across all subjects. It iterates over each student in the dictionary, calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of subjects, and stores the average grade in a new dictionary.\n2.  `find_top_student`: This function finds the student with the highest average grade. It uses the `max` function with a key argument to find the student with the highest average grade.\n3.  `main`: This function defines a dictionary containing student names as keys and their respective grades in different subjects as values. It then calls the `calculate_average_grade` function to calculate the average grade for each student and the `find_top_student` function to find the student with the highest average grade. Finally, it prints the average grades for each student and the student with the highest average grade.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of students and m is the average number of subjects per student. This is because the solution iterates over each student and each subject to calculate the average grade.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of students. This is because the solution stores the average grades for each student in a new dictionary.",
