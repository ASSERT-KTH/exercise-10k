  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef lucas_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to generate the Lucas sequence up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 2, 1  # The first two numbers in the Lucas sequence\n    i = 0  # Counter for the while loop\n    while i < n:\n        print(a, end=\" \")  # Print the current number in the sequence\n        a, b = b, a + b  # Update the numbers for the next iteration\n        i += 1  # Increment the counter\n\n# Call the function to print the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence\nlucas_sequence(10)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `lucas_sequence(n)` that generates the Lucas sequence up to the nth number. It uses a while loop to iterate over the sequence, printing each number as it is generated. The `a` and `b` variables are used to keep track of the current and next numbers in the sequence, and the `i` variable is used as a counter to control the loop.\n\nYou can adjust the argument passed to the `lucas_sequence` function to print a different number of terms in the sequence.",
