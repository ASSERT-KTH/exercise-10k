  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a year as input and prints whether it is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the given year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    elif year % 100 != 0:\n        return True\n    elif year % 400 != 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `is_leap_year(year)` that checks whether a year is a leap year.\n2.  The `main()` function takes a year as input from the user and calls `is_leap_year(year)` to determine whether it's a leap year.\n3.  The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThe logic for determining a leap year follows the rules provided:\n\n*   If the year is not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year.\n*   If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it's a leap year.\n*   If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not a leap year.\n*   If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.",
