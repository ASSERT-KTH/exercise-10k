  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces based on user input. The pattern should consist of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks followed by a sequence of spaces. The number of asterisks in each row should increase by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces should decrease by 1, starting from the user-inputted number. Use loops (for/while) to generate the pattern.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int num;\n    cin >> num;\n\n    int i = 1;\n    while (i <= num) {\n        int j = 1;\n        while (j <= i) {\n            cout << \"*\";\n            j++;\n        }\n\n        int k = 1;\n        while (k <= num - i) {\n            cout << \" \";\n            k++;\n        }\n\n        cout << endl;\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code reads an integer input from the user, generates the pattern based on the input, and prints it to the console. The pattern consists of a series of rows, with each row containing a sequence of asterisks (`*`) followed by a sequence of spaces. The number of asterisks in each row increases by 1, starting from 1, and the number of spaces decreases by 1, starting from the user-inputted number.",
