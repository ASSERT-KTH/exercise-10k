  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\n# Test the function\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nresult = sum_even_numbers(n)\nprint(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by initializing a variable `total` to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of all even numbers.\n*   We use a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n`.\n*   Inside the loop, we use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the current number `i` is even. If `i` is even, `i % 2` will be 0, and we add `i` to `total`.\n*   Finally, we return the `total` sum after iterating over all numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf you input `10` when prompted, the program will output:\n\n```\nThe sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is 30\n```\n\nThis is because the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30.",
