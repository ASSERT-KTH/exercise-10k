  "answer": "Here's a Python program to manage a bank account using a while loop:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposit Successful. Your new balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient balance. Withdrawal failed.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawal Successful. Your new balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Your current balance is: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management System\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### How the program works:\n1. The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.\n2. The `main` function creates an instance of `BankAccount` and enters a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input.\n3. The user is presented with a menu to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit the program.\n4. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding method of the `BankAccount` class is called.\n5. If the user chooses to exit, the program breaks out of the loop and terminates.\n\n### Example usage:\n- Run the program and choose option 1 to deposit $100.\n- Choose option 2 to withdraw $50.\n- Choose option 3 to check the balance.\n- Choose option 4 to exit the program.",
