  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student (A, B, C, D, F).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if not 0 <= score <= 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid score.

If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   Then, it uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n*   The `main` function gets the score from the user, calls the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also handles any `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised by the `calculate_grade` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n*   Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n*   Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n*   Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n*   Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_grade` that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2.  Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100) and raise a `ValueError` if not.\n3.  Use conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n4.  Define a `main` function to get the score from the user and call the `calculate_grade` function.\n5.  Handle any `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised by the `calculate_grade` function.\n6.  Print the result.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to handle invalid inputs and exceptions properly to prevent the program from crashing.\n*   Use clear and descriptive variable names and function names to improve readability.\n*   Use comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.\n*   Test the program thoroughly with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.",
