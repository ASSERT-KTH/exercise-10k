  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a story template with placeholders for different types of words (e.g. noun, verb, adjective), then asks the user to input words to fill in the placeholders and prints out the completed story.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\n# Define a function to get user input for a specific word type\ndef get_word(prompt):\n    while True:\n        word = input(prompt)\n        if word:\n            return word\n        print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\n# Define the story template with placeholders\nstory_template = \"\"\"\nOnce upon a time, in a {adjective1} land, there lived a {adjective2} {noun1}. This {noun1} loved to {verb1} in the {adjective3} sun. One day, while {verb2} through the {adjective4} forest, the {noun1} stumbled upon a {adjective5} {noun2}. The {noun1} was so {adjective6} that it decided to {verb3} the {noun2} home.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define the placeholders and their corresponding prompts\nplaceholders = {\n    \"adjective1\": \"Enter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): \",\n    \"adjective2\": \"Enter another adjective (e.g. big, fluffy, smart): \",\n    \"noun1\": \"Enter a noun (e.g. dog, cat, car): \",\n    \"verb1\": \"Enter a verb ending in -ing (e.g. running, jumping, dancing): \",\n    \"adjective3\": \"Enter an adjective (e.g. warm, sunny, cloudy): \",\n    \"verb2\": \"Enter another verb ending in -ing (e.g. walking, hiking, biking): \",\n    \"adjective4\": \"Enter an adjective (e.g. dark, mysterious, magical): \",\n    \"adjective5\": \"Enter an adjective (e.g. beautiful, old, rusty): \",\n    \"noun2\": \"Enter another noun (e.g. book, chair, tree): \",\n    \"adjective6\": \"Enter an adjective (e.g. excited, curious, happy): \",\n    \"verb3\": \"Enter a verb (e.g. take, bring, carry): \"\n}\n\n# Get user input for each placeholder\nuser_input = {}\nfor placeholder, prompt in placeholders.items():\n    user_input[placeholder] = get_word(prompt)\n\n# Fill in the story template with the user's input\ncompleted_story = story_template.format(**user_input)\n\n# Print the completed story\nprint(\"\\nHere is the completed story:\")\nprint(completed_story)\n```\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt the user to input words for each placeholder. The user's input will be used to fill in the story template, and the completed story will be printed out.\n\nHere's an example of what the program might look like when run:\n```\nEnter an adjective (e.g. happy, tall, green): beautiful\nEnter another adjective (e.g. big, fluffy, smart): fluffy\nEnter a noun (e.g. dog, cat, car): cat\nEnter a verb ending in -ing (e.g. running, jumping, dancing): pouncing\nEnter an adjective (e.g. warm, sunny, cloudy): sunny\nEnter another verb ending in -ing (e.g. walking, hiking, biking): exploring\nEnter an adjective (e.g. dark, mysterious, magical): magical\nEnter an adjective (e.g. beautiful, old, rusty): old\nEnter another noun (e.g. book, chair, tree): book\nEnter an adjective (e.g. excited, curious, happy): excited\nEnter a verb (e.g. take, bring, carry): take\n\nHere is the completed story:\nOnce upon a time, in a beautiful land, there lived a fluffy cat. This cat loved to pouncing in the sunny sun. One day, while exploring through the magical forest, the cat stumbled upon an old book. The cat was so excited that it decided to take the book home.\n```",
