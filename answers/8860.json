  "answer": "**Calculating Average Ignoring Zeros**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the average of a list of numbers while ignoring zeros.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_average_ignoring_zeros(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers ignoring zeros.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the non-zero numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num != 0]\n    if not non_zero_numbers:\n        return 0\n    return sum(non_zero_numbers) / len(non_zero_numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]\naverage = calculate_average_ignoring_zeros(numbers)\nprint(\"Average ignoring zeros:\", average)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average_ignoring_zeros` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list `non_zero_numbers` that includes only the non-zero numbers from the input list.\n3. If the `non_zero_numbers` list is empty (i.e., all numbers in the input list were zero), the function returns 0.\n4. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the non-zero numbers by summing them up and dividing by the count of non-zero numbers.\n5. The function returns the calculated average.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This function assumes that the input list contains only numbers (either integers or floats).\n* If the input list is empty, the function will also return 0, as there are no numbers to calculate an average from.",
