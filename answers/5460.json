  "answer": "**Word Guessing Game**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random word and lets the user guess it by inputting individual letters.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nword_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\ndef word_guessing_game():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word_to_guess = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word_to_guess)\n\n    # Create a list to store the guessed letters\n    guessed_word = ['_'] * word_length\n    guessed_letters = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the Word Guessing Game!\")\n    print(f\"You have {tries} tries to guess the word.\")\n\n    while '_' in guessed_word and tries > 0:\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n        guess = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) != 1:\n            print(\"Please guess one letter at a time.\")\n            continue\n\n        if guess in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You already guessed this letter. Try another one.\")\n            continue\n\n        guessed_letters.append(guess)\n\n        if guess not in word_to_guess:\n            tries -= 1\n            print(f\"Incorrect guess. You have {tries} tries left.\")\n        else:\n            for i, letter in enumerate(word_to_guess):\n                if letter == guess:\n                    guessed_word[i] = guess\n\n    if '_' not in guessed_word:\n        print(' '.join(guessed_word))\n        print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the word.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"You didn't guess the word. The word was {word_to_guess}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    word_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display a series of underscores representing the word to guess.\n3. Guess a letter by typing it in and pressing Enter.\n4. If the letter is in the word, the program will fill in the corresponding underscores.\n5. If the letter is not in the word, the program will decrease the number of tries left.\n6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or run out of tries.\n\n**Notes**\n--------\n\n* The program chooses a random word from the `word_list`.\n* The user has 6 tries to guess the word.\n* The program displays the current state of the guessed word after each guess.\n* The program checks if the user has already guessed a letter and prevents them from guessing the same letter again.",
