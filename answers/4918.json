  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a password as input and prints whether it is strong (at least 8 characters, contains uppercase and lowercase letters, and at least one digit) or not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport re\n\ndef strong_password(password):\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n    return True\n\npassword = input(\"Enter a password: \")\nif strong_password(password):\n    print(\"The password is strong.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The password is not strong.\")\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including:\n\n* Importing the `re` module\n* Defining the `strong_password` function with four conditions\n* Defining the `password` variable and reading input from the user\n* Checking the strength of the password and printing the result\n* Using regular expressions to check for specific character types in the password\n\nNote that I've used the `re.search` function to search for the specified character types in the password, as it provides a more concise and efficient way to perform the checks.",
