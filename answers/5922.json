  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Initialize the number of guesses\n    num_guesses = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of guesses\n        num_guesses += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} guesses.\".format(num_guesses))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will tell them if their guess is higher or lower than the number.\n4. The user can keep guessing until they find the correct number.\n5. If the user wants to quit, they can type \"quit\" and the program will reveal the correct number.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they find the correct number or quit.\n* The program uses a `try`-`except` block to handle invalid input (e.g. if the user enters a non-numeric value).\n* The program keeps track of the number of guesses the user has made and displays this information when the user finds the correct number.",
