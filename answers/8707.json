  "answer": "**Simple Countdown Timer**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple countdown timer implemented in Python.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef countdown(t):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts down from the given time in seconds.\n\n    Args:\n        t (int): Time in seconds.\n    \"\"\"\n    while t:\n        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)\n        timer = '{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(mins, secs)\n        print(timer, end=\"\\r\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n        t -= 1\n    print('Time Up!!')\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    t = input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \")\n\n    # Validate input\n    try:\n        t = int(t)\n        if t <= 0:\n            print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        else:\n            countdown(t)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `countdown` function takes an integer `t` representing the time in seconds.\n2. The function uses a while loop to decrement the time every second.\n3. The `divmod` function is used to calculate the minutes and seconds from the total time.\n4. The timer is formatted as `MM:SS` and printed to the console.\n5. The `end=\"\\r\"` argument in the `print` function is used to overwrite the current line, creating a countdown effect.\n6. The `time.sleep(1)` function is used to pause the execution for 1 second between each iteration.\n7. The `main` function gets the time from the user, validates the input, and calls the `countdown` function.\n\n### Running the Code\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `timer.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the code using the command `python timer.py`.\n4. Enter the time in seconds when prompted, and the countdown will start.",
