  "prompt": "Create a program that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The program should determine the winner based on the game's rules and output the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python:\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_winner(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    winning_combinations = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combination in winning_combinations:\n        if board[combination[0]] == board[combination[1]] == board[combination[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combination[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main game loop.\"\"\"\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    current_player = \"X\"\n\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(f\"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_winner(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Player {result} wins!\")\n            break\n        current_player = \"O\" if current_player == \"X\" else \"X\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Initialization**: The program starts by initializing an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board and setting the current player to \"X\".\n2. **Game Loop**: The game is played in a loop where each player is asked to enter their move (1-9).\n3. **Move Validation**: The program checks if the move is valid. If the move is not valid (i.e., the space is already occupied), the player is asked to enter a new move.\n4. **Update Board**: The move is applied to the board, and the current player is switched.\n5. **Check Winner**: After each move, the program checks if there is a winner by examining all possible winning combinations.\n6. **Game Over**: If there is a winner or a tie, the game ends, and the result is printed. Otherwise, the game continues.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `tic_tac_toe.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python tic_tac_toe.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
