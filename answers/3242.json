  "prompt": "Create a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    number (int): The number for which the multiplication table is printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        product = number * i\n        print(f\"{number} x {i} = {product}\")\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    print_multiplication_table(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `print_multiplication_table` function takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.\n2. The `for` loop in the `print_multiplication_table` function iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, the product of the input number and the current iteration number is calculated.\n4. The multiplication equation and its result are printed using an f-string.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number.\n6. The entered number is passed to the `print_multiplication_table` function to print its multiplication table.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a number. For example, if you enter `5`, it will print the multiplication table for 5 up to 10:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```",
