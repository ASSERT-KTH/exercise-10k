  "answer": "**Calculating Factorial using a While Loop**\n\n### Overview\nThe factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted by `n!` and is calculated as `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number for which the factorial is to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    factorial = 1\n    i = 2\n    while i <= n:\n        factorial *= i\n        i += 1\n\n    return factorial\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {calculate_factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. Check if the input number `n` is negative. If it is, raise a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n2. If `n` is 0 or 1, return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n3. Initialize a variable `factorial` to 1 and a counter `i` to 2.\n4. Use a while loop to iterate from 2 to `n`.\n5. In each iteration, multiply the `factorial` by `i` and increment `i` by 1.\n6. After the loop finishes, return the calculated `factorial`.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because it uses a single loop that runs `n` times.",
