  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax for a given income and tax rate.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax for a given income and tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax for.\n        tax_rate (float): The tax rate as a decimal (e.g. 0.25 for 25%).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax = income * tax_rate\n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g. 25 for 25%): \")) / 100\n\n    # Calculate tax\n    tax = calculate_tax(income, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your net income is: ${income - tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your income (e.g. `50000`).\n3. Enter the tax rate as a percentage (e.g. `25` for 25%).\n4. The program will calculate and display your tax and net income.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple tax calculation with a single tax rate.\n* In a real-world scenario, tax calculations can be more complex and involve multiple tax rates, deductions, and other factors.\n* This program is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual tax calculations.",
