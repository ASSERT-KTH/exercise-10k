  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank account. The program should take in the account balance and output the updated balance based on the following conditions: if the user deposits money, add the deposit amount to the balance, if the user withdraws money, subtract the withdrawal amount from the balance, if the user checks the balance, output the current balance.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a bank account based on the conditions you provided:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the BankAccount class with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            balance (float): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit money into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw money from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Check the current balance of the account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new bank account with an initial balance\n    balance = float(input(\"Enter the initial account balance: $\"))\n    account = BankAccount(balance)\n\n    while True:\n        # Display menu options\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        # Get user input\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. The `main` function creates a new bank account and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with their account.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: The program prompts the user to enter the initial account balance.\n2. **Deposit Money**: The user selects the \"Deposit money\" option and enters the amount to deposit. The program adds the deposit amount to the balance and displays the updated balance.\n3. **Withdraw Money**: The user selects the \"Withdraw money\" option and enters the amount to withdraw. The program subtracts the withdrawal amount from the balance and displays the updated balance, or displays an error message if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.\n4. **Check Balance**: The user selects the \"Check balance\" option, and the program displays the current balance.\n5. **Exit**: The user selects the \"Exit\" option, and the program terminates.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple `float` data type to represent the balance, which may not be suitable for real-world banking applications where precision and accuracy are crucial. Consider using a more robust data type, such as `decimal`, to represent financial amounts.\n* The program does not handle exceptions or errors that may occur during user input or account operations. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors and provide a more robust user experience.\n* The program uses a simple menu-driven interface, which may not be suitable for large-scale banking applications. Consider using a more advanced user interface framework, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface, to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.",
