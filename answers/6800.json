  "prompt": "Write a program that sorts a list of books based on their titles. The books are represented as strings in the format 'title,author'. The program should take a list of books as input, sort them alphabetically by title, and then print out the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef sort_books(books):\n    sorted_books = sorted(books, key=lambda book: book.split(',')[0])\n    return sorted_books\n\nbooks = [\n    \"To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee\",\n    \"1984,George Orwell\",\n    \"Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen\",\n    \"The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald\",\n    \"Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bront\u00eb\"\n]\n\nsorted_books = sort_books(books)\n\nfor book in sorted_books:\n    print(book)\n```\nThis code defines the `sort_books` function, which takes a list of books as input and returns a sorted list of books based on their titles. The `sorted` function is used with a lambda function as the `key` argument to specify that the sorting should be based on the title of each book.\n\nThe code then creates a list of books, calls the `sort_books` function to sort the list, and prints out the sorted list of books.\n\nWhen run, this code will output:\n```\n1984,George Orwell\nJane Eyre,Charlotte Bront\u00eb\nPride and Prejudice,Jane Austen\nThe Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald\nTo Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee\n```\nThe books are sorted alphabetically by title, as expected.",
