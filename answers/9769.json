  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers as input and returns their LCM.\n2. It calculates the GCD of the two numbers using the `math.gcd` function.\n3. The LCM is then calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_lcm` function with an example.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the GCD, which is more efficient than implementing a custom GCD algorithm.\n* The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.\n* The `abs` function is used to handle cases where the input numbers are negative.",
