  "answer": "**Decimal to Binary Converter**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that converts decimal numbers to binary using if/else statements and recursion.\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a decimal number to binary.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The decimal number to convert.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The binary representation of the decimal number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return \"1\"\n    else:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            # If the number is even, divide by 2 and add 0 to the end\n            return decimal_to_binary(n // 2) + \"0\"\n        else:\n            # If the number is odd, divide by 2 and add 1 to the end\n            return decimal_to_binary(n // 2) + \"1\"\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    decimal_num = int(input(\"Enter a decimal number: \"))\n    binary_num = decimal_to_binary(decimal_num)\n    print(f\"The binary representation of {decimal_num} is: {binary_num}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `decimal_to_binary` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns the string \"0\" or \"1\" respectively.\n3. Otherwise, it checks if `n` is even or odd by using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4. If `n` is even, it divides `n` by 2 and adds \"0\" to the end of the result.\n5. If `n` is odd, it divides `n` by 2 and adds \"1\" to the end of the result.\n6. The `main` function asks the user for a decimal number, converts it to binary, and prints the result.\n\n**Note:** This program uses recursion, which means it calls itself repeatedly until it reaches the base case. This can be less efficient than an iterative approach for large numbers. However, it is often easier to understand and implement for simple problems like this.",
