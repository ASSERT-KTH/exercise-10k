  "prompt": "Create a program that declares and initializes variables to store a student's name, age, and grade level. The program should then print out the stored information in a formatted string. Ensure that the variables are declared with appropriate data types.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\n// Variable declarations\nstring name = \"Luis Larco\";\nint age = 15;\nint level = 9;\n\n// Printing the variables\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Name: \" + name);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Age: \" + age);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Grade Level: \" + level);\n```\nThis code declares three variables, `name`, `age`, and `level`, with the specified data types and initial values. It then prints out the values of these variables using `Console.WriteLine` statements, with some additional text to provide context. The output of this code will be:\n```\nName: Luis Larco\nAge: 15\nGrade Level: 9\n```",
