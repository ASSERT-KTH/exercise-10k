  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the sum of even numbers in a given list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of even numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)\n    return even_sum\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `sum_even_numbers` takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and filter out odd numbers.\n3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the even numbers.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. Define a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list `numbers` as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `even_sum` to store the sum of even numbers.\n3. Use a generator expression to iterate over the list and filter out odd numbers.\n4. Use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the even numbers.\n5. Return the result.\n\n### Advice\n\n* This function assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list may contain other types of numbers or non-numeric values, additional error checking should be added.\n* This function uses a generator expression, which is a memory-efficient way to perform calculations on large lists. However, for very large lists, it may be more efficient to use a traditional `for` loop.",
