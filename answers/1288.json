  "prompt": "Write a function that creates a copy of a given dictionary.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that duplicates a given dictionary, ensuring you have a clear understanding of the process and the code involved. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef copy_dictionary(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a copy of a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be copied.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A copy of the input dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is indeed a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(input_dict, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    # We use the built-in dict.copy() method to create a copy of the dictionary\n    # This method returns a shallow copy of the dictionary, which means it creates a new dictionary and then (to the extent possible) inserts references to the original elements\n    copied_dict = input_dict.copy()\n\n    # Finally, we return the copied dictionary\n    return copied_dict\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\ncopied_dict = copy_dictionary(original_dict)\nprint(copied_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `copy_dictionary` starts by validating the input to ensure it's a dictionary using `isinstance(input_dict, dict)`. If the input is not a dictionary, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes the built-in `dict.copy()` method to create a shallow copy of the input dictionary `input_dict`. This method is assigned to the variable `copied_dict`.\n* The function returns `copied_dict`, which is the copied version of the original dictionary.\n* In the example usage, an original dictionary `original_dict` is created and passed to the `copy_dictionary` function, demonstrating how to use the function and verifying its correctness by printing the copied dictionary.",
