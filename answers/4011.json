  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 checkerboard pattern of asterisks (*) and dots (.).",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Create a 5x5 grid filled with asterisks (*)\ngrid = [['*' for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n\n# Replace alternate squares with dots (.)\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if (i + j) % 2 == 1:\n            grid[i][j] = '.'\n\n# Print the checkerboard pattern\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(row))\n```\nThis code creates a 5x5 grid of asterisks, replaces alternate squares with dots, and then prints the resulting checkerboard pattern.",
