  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer grade score as input and outputs the corresponding grade level based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade level.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(getGrade(95));\n        System.out.println(getGrade(72));\n        System.out.println(getGrade(66));\n        System.out.println(getGrade(0));\n    }\n\n    public static String getGrade(int score) {\n        String grade = \"\";\n\n        if (score >= 90 && score <= 100) {\n            grade = \"A\";\n        } else if (score >= 80 && score < 90) {\n            grade = \"B\";\n        } else if (score >= 70 && score < 80) {\n            grade = \"C\";\n        } else if (score >= 60 && score < 70) {\n            grade = \"D\";\n        } else if (score < 60 && score >= 0) {\n            grade = \"F\";\n        } else {\n            grade = \"Invalid score\";\n        }\n\n        return grade;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that calls the `getGrade` method with different input values and prints the results. The `getGrade` method takes an integer `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade level as a string. The method uses an empty string `grade` and a series of `if-else` statements to determine the grade level based on the input `score`. The resulting grade level is returned by the method.",
