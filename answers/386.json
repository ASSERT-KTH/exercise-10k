  "answer": "**Calculating the Volume of a Sphere**\n\n### Overview\nThis program calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius using the formula `V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3`, where `V` is the volume and `r` is the radius.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sphere_volume(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)\n        print(f\"The volume of the sphere is: {volume:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n* The `calculate_sphere_volume` function takes the radius as input and returns the calculated volume.\n* The formula `V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3` is used to calculate the volume.\n* The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius, calls the `calculate_sphere_volume` function, and prints the result.\n* Error handling is implemented to check for negative radius values.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Enter a radius of 5 to calculate the volume of a sphere with a radius of 5 units.\n* Enter a radius of -3 to see an error message indicating that the radius cannot be negative.",
