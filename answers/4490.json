  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Function**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following function calculates a student's grade based on their scores on several assignments. The function takes in a dictionary of assignment names and scores, as well as a dictionary of assignment weights.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(assignment_scores, assignment_weights):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their scores on several assignments.\n\n    Args:\n        assignment_scores (dict): A dictionary of assignment names and scores.\n        assignment_weights (dict): A dictionary of assignment names and weights.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The student's grade as a percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize total score and total weight\n    total_score = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each assignment\n    for assignment, score in assignment_scores.items():\n        # Get the weight of the current assignment\n        weight = assignment_weights.get(assignment)\n\n        # If the assignment has a weight, add the weighted score to the total score\n        if weight is not None:\n            total_score += score * weight\n            total_weight += weight\n\n    # Calculate the grade as a percentage\n    if total_weight == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return (total_score / total_weight) * 100\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    assignment_scores = {\n        \"Assignment 1\": 90,\n        \"Assignment 2\": 80,\n        \"Assignment 3\": 95\n    }\n\n    assignment_weights = {\n        \"Assignment 1\": 0.3,\n        \"Assignment 2\": 0.2,\n        \"Assignment 3\": 0.5\n    }\n\n    grade = calculate_grade(assignment_scores, assignment_weights)\n    print(f\"Student's grade: {grade:.2f}%\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_grade` takes in two dictionaries: `assignment_scores` and `assignment_weights`.\n2. It initializes two variables, `total_score` and `total_weight`, to keep track of the total weighted score and total weight.\n3. The function then iterates over each assignment in `assignment_scores`.\n4. For each assignment, it gets the corresponding weight from `assignment_weights` and adds the weighted score to `total_score`.\n5. Finally, the function calculates the grade as a percentage by dividing `total_score` by `total_weight` and multiplying by 100.\n6. The function returns the calculated grade.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example usage, we create two dictionaries: `assignment_scores` and `assignment_weights`. We then call the `calculate_grade` function with these dictionaries and print the result. The output will be the student's grade as a percentage.",
