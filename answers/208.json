  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition, addressing your request for a comprehensive explanation and code implementation. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns their composition.\n    \n    The composition of two functions f and g is a new function that first applies g and then applies f to the result.\n    \n    :param f: The first function to be applied in the composition.\n    :param g: The second function to be applied in the composition.\n    :return: A new function that is the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We define a new function that will be the composition of f and g\n    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # First, we apply g to the arguments\n        intermediate_result = g(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Then, we apply f to the result of g\n        final_result = f(intermediate_result)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the final result\n        return final_result\n    \n    # We return the composed function\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ncomposited = compose_functions(add_one, double)\nprint(composited(5))  # Outputs: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions `f` and `g` as arguments and returns a new function `composed_function` that represents their composition.\n* Within `composed_function`, it first applies function `g` to the input arguments `*args` and `**kwargs`, storing the result in `intermediate_result`.\n* Then, it applies function `f` to `intermediate_result`, storing the final outcome in `final_result`.\n* Finally, `composed_function` returns `final_result`, effectively computing the composition of `f` and `g` for any given input.",
