  "answer": "**Perfect Number Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is perfect, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        return False\n\n    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors\n    divisor_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)\n\n    # Check if the sum of proper divisors is equal to the number\n    return divisor_sum == n\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    numbers = [6, 28, 12, 496]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_perfect_number(num):\n            print(f\"{num} is a perfect number\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{num} is not a perfect number\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `is_perfect_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's a perfect number.\n*   It first checks if the number is less than 1, in which case it's not perfect.\n*   Then, it calculates the sum of the proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) using a generator expression.\n*   Finally, it checks if the sum of the proper divisors is equal to `n` and returns `True` if it is, indicating that `n` is a perfect number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   `is_perfect_number(6)` returns `True` because 6 is a perfect number (1 + 2 + 3 = 6).\n*   `is_perfect_number(28)` returns `True` because 28 is a perfect number (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28).\n*   `is_perfect_number(12)` returns `False` because 12 is not a perfect number (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, not 12).",
