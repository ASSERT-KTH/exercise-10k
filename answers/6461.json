  "prompt": "Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs where keys are names of fruits and values are their corresponding colors",
  "answer": "Here's a Python dictionary with 5 key-value pairs where keys are names of fruits and values are their corresponding colors:\n\n```python\nfruit_colors = {\n    \"Apple\": \"Red\",\n    \"Banana\": \"Yellow\",\n    \"Mango\": \"Yellow\",\n    \"Grapes\": \"Purple\",\n    \"Watermelon\": \"Green\"\n}\n\nprint(fruit_colors)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it creates a dictionary called `fruit_colors` with 5 key-value pairs and prints it out. The keys are the names of the fruits, and the values are their corresponding colors. \n\nAlternatively, if you want to access a specific fruit's color, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(fruit_colors[\"Apple\"])  # Outputs: Red\n```",
