  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it prints out if the guess is higher or lower than the generated number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    guess = None\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Take a guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the guess is in the correct range\n        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the attempt counter\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low!\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high!\")\n\n    # Print a success message\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and ask you to guess it.\n3. Enter a number, and the program will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the generated number.\n4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n5. The program will print out the number of attempts it took you to find the correct number.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses `random.randint` to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they find the correct number.\n* The program checks if the user's input is a valid integer and if it's within the correct range.\n* The program uses an `attempts` counter to keep track of the number of guesses the user makes.",
