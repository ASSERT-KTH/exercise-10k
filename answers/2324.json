  "answer": "**Printing a List of Numbers**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that prints a list of numbers to the screen, one number per line.\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a list of numbers to the screen, one number per line.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for number in numbers:\n        print(number)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint_numbers(numbers)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `print_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each number in the list.\n3. Inside the loop, the `print` function is used to print each number to the screen.\n4. The example usage shows how to call the `print_numbers` function with a list of numbers.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\nWhen you run this program with the example usage, it will print the following output:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\nEach number is printed on a separate line.",
