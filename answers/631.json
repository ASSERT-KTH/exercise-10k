  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the cost of driving a car given the distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and fuel price.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_driving_cost(distance, fuel_efficiency, fuel_price):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cost of driving a car given the distance traveled, \n    fuel efficiency, and fuel price.\n\n    Args:\n    distance (float): The distance traveled in miles.\n    fuel_efficiency (float): The fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon.\n    fuel_price (float): The price of fuel in dollars per gallon.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The cost of driving the car for the given distance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the amount of fuel consumed\n    fuel_consumed = distance / fuel_efficiency\n    \n    # Calculate the cost of driving\n    driving_cost = fuel_consumed * fuel_price\n    \n    return driving_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in miles: \"))\n    fuel_efficiency = float(input(\"Enter the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon: \"))\n    fuel_price = float(input(\"Enter the price of fuel in dollars per gallon: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the driving cost\n    driving_cost = calculate_driving_cost(distance, fuel_efficiency, fuel_price)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The cost of driving the car for {distance} miles is ${driving_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_driving_cost` function takes in three parameters: `distance`, `fuel_efficiency`, and `fuel_price`. It calculates the amount of fuel consumed by dividing the distance traveled by the fuel efficiency, then calculates the cost of driving by multiplying the fuel consumed by the fuel price.\n*   The `main` function gets user input for the distance, fuel efficiency, and fuel price, calls the `calculate_driving_cost` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If you travel 250 miles with a car that has a fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon and the fuel price is $3.00 per gallon, the program will calculate the cost of driving to be $25.00.\n*   If you travel 500 miles with a car that has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon and the fuel price is $2.75 per gallon, the program will calculate the cost of driving to be $55.00.",
