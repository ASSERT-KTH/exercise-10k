  "answer": "**Function to Find Index of First Occurrence in a List**\n\n### Description\nThis function takes a list and a value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list if it exists. If the value does not exist in the list, it returns -1.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        value: The value to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the value if it exists, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(value)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    value = 3\n    index = find_index(lst, value)\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"The first occurrence of {value} is at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{value} does not exist in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The `find_index` function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.\n*   If the value is not found in the list, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `find_index` function with an example list and value.",
