  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\nV = s\u00b3\n\nwhere V is the volume and s is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes a single argument `side_length`, which is the length of a side of the cube.\n2. The function checks if the `side_length` is a positive number. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The volume of the cube is calculated using the formula V = s\u00b3, where s is the `side_length`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_volume` function. It prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube, calculates the volume, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a side length of 5 when prompted.\n* The program will output the volume of the cube, which is approximately 125.00 cubic units.",
