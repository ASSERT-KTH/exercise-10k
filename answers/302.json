  "prompt": "Write a function that returns the element at a specified index in a given list.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll provide you with a function that retrieves an element at a specified position from a given list, along with a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef get_element_at_index(lst, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the element at a specified index in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        index (int): The index of the element to be retrieved.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The element at the specified index if it exists, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list\n    # This is because list indices in Python start at 0 and go up to len(list) - 1\n    if index < 0 or index >= len(lst):\n        \n        # If the index is out of bounds, we return None\n        # This could also be handled by raising an exception, depending on the requirements\n        return None\n    \n    # If the index is within bounds, we can simply return the element at that index\n    # We use the built-in list indexing syntax for this\n    return lst[index]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_element_at_index` takes two parameters: `lst` (the input list) and `index` (the position of the element to be retrieved). It first checks if the provided `index` is within the valid range of the list `lst`.\n* If the `index` is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of `lst`), the function returns `None` to indicate that the index is invalid. You could also choose to raise an exception instead, depending on your specific requirements.\n* If the `index` is valid, the function uses Python's built-in list indexing feature to return the element at the specified `index` in the list `lst`.\n* This approach ensures that the function handles both valid and invalid index inputs gracefully, providing a robust way to access elements in a list.",
