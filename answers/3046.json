  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Winner Function**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function determines the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game given the choices of two players.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\n\n    Args:\n        player1_choice (str): The choice of player 1. Can be 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.\n        player2_choice (str): The choice of player 2. Can be 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The winner of the game. Can be 'Player 1', 'Player 2', or 'Tie'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the winning conditions\n    winning_conditions = {\n        'Rock': 'Scissors',\n        'Paper': 'Rock',\n        'Scissors': 'Paper'\n    }\n\n    # Check if the choices are valid\n    if player1_choice not in winning_conditions or player2_choice not in winning_conditions:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid choice. Choices must be 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.\")\n\n    # Check for a tie\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return 'Tie'\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    if winning_conditions[player1_choice] == player2_choice:\n        return 'Player 1'\n    else:\n        return 'Player 2'\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    print(determine_winner('Rock', 'Scissors'))  # Output: Player 1\n    print(determine_winner('Paper', 'Rock'))  # Output: Player 1\n    print(determine_winner('Scissors', 'Paper'))  # Output: Player 1\n    print(determine_winner('Rock', 'Rock'))  # Output: Tie\n    print(determine_winner('Paper', 'Scissors'))  # Output: Player 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a dictionary `winning_conditions` that maps each choice to the choice it beats.\n2. Check if the choices are valid by ensuring they are in the `winning_conditions` dictionary.\n3. Check for a tie by comparing the two choices.\n4. Determine the winner by checking if the choice of player 1 beats the choice of player 2.\n5. Return the winner of the game.",
