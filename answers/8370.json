  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that calculates the LCM of two given numbers:\n```\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nprint(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm(num1, num2)}\")\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `lcm` function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. We use integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer.\n3. The program prompts the user to input two numbers, and then calls the `lcm` function to calculate the LCM.\n4. The result is printed to the console.\n\nExample use case:\n\n* Input: `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 15`\n* Output: `The LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60`\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input numbers are positive integers. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you may need to modify the code accordingly.",
