  "answer": "**Guessing Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program plays a simple guessing game with the user. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The program uses conditional statements to determine if the user's guess is correct, higher, or lower than the generated number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The user guesses the number correctly on the first try.\n* The user guesses a number that is too low, and the program tells them to try again.\n* The user guesses a number that is too high, and the program tells them to try again.\n* The user types \"quit\" to exit the game.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program initializes the number of tries to 0.\n3. The program enters a loop where it asks the user for their guess.\n4. If the user types \"quit\", the program exits the loop and reveals the number.\n5. If the user enters a valid integer, the program checks if it is correct, too low, or too high.\n6. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates them and exits the loop.\n7. If the user's guess is too low or too high, the program tells them to try again and increments the number of tries.",
