  "answer": "**Tic Tac Toe Game**\n======================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program plays a game of Tic Tac Toe with the user. The user is 'X' and the computer is 'O'. The game board is a 3x3 grid, with the user and computer taking turns to place their marks.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board\"\"\"\n    print(f\"{board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]}\")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner\"\"\"\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combo[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Make a random move for the computer\"\"\"\n    available_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    move = random.choice(available_moves)\n    board[move] = \"O\"\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move(board)\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will print the current state of the board.\n3. Enter your move by typing a number between 1 and 9, where 1 corresponds to the top left square and 9 corresponds to the bottom right square.\n4. The program will update the board with your move and then make a random move for the computer.\n5. The game will continue until either the user or the computer wins, or until the board is full (a tie).\n\nNote: This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe and the computer's moves are random. In a more advanced version, the computer's moves could be determined by a AI algorithm.",
