  "prompt": "Write a program to create a Person class with attributes like name, age, and occupation, and methods to display person's details.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that creates a Person class with the specified attributes and methods:\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class representing a person with attributes like name, age, and occupation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, name, age, occupation):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a Person object with the given name, age, and occupation.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The person's name.\n            age (int): The person's age.\n            occupation (str): The person's occupation.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.occupation = occupation\n\n    def display_details(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Displays the person's details.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n        print(f\"Age: {self.age} years old\")\n        print(f\"Occupation: {self.occupation}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a Person object\n    person = Person(\"John Doe\", 30, \"Software Developer\")\n\n    # Display the person's details\n    print(\"Person Details:\")\n    person.display_details()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a `Person` class with an `__init__` method to initialize the object's attributes (`name`, `age`, and `occupation`) and a `display_details` method to print out the person's details.\n\nThe `main` function creates a `Person` object and calls the `display_details` method to display the person's information.\n\nExample Output:\n```\nPerson Details:\nName: John Doe\nAge: 30 years old\nOccupation: Software Developer\n```\nThis program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation (hiding data and behavior within a class) and abstraction (representing complex data and behavior with a simple interface).",
