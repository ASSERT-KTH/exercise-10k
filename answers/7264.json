  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# variable declaration\nscore = 0\n\n# input\nscore = float(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n# conditional statements\nif score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n    print(\"A\")\nelif score >= 80 and score < 90:\n    print(\"B\")\nelif score >= 70 and score < 80:\n    print(\"C\")\nelif score >= 60 and score < 70:\n    print(\"D\")\nelse:\n    print(\"F\")\n```\nI've followed the specification exactly, using `float` to allow for decimal scores, and using the specified range for each grade. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
