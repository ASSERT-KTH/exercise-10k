  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a guessing game with the user, where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made\n    tries = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    print(\"Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.\\n\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the player for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I was thinking of number {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of tries the player has made\n        tries += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `guessing_game` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n- The `while` loop keeps asking the user for their guess until they either guess the number correctly or type \"quit\".\n- The program checks if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess and provides a hint accordingly.\n- The program also keeps track of the number of tries the player has made and displays it when they guess the number correctly.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- Run the program and start guessing numbers.\n- Type \"quit\" to stop playing and reveal the number.\n- Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible to win the game.",
