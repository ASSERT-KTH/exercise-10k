  "answer": "**File Reader Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that reads input from a file and prints out the contents.\n\n```python\ndef read_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads the contents of a file and prints it out.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the file to be read.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            contents = file.read()\n            print(contents)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = input(\"Enter the file path: \")\n    read_file(file_path)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `file_reader.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python file_reader.py`).\n3. When prompted, enter the path to the file you want to read.\n4. The program will print out the contents of the file.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program assumes that the file is in text format and can be read using the `open` function in Python.\n* The program handles exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError` and other general exceptions.\n* The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.",
