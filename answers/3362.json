  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Calculation using While Loop**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that uses a while loop to calculate the sum of even numbers from 2 to 100:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of even numbers within a given range.\n\n    Args:\n    start (int): The starting number of the range (inclusive).\n    end (int): The ending number of the range (inclusive).\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of even numbers within the range.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    current = start\n    while current <= end:\n        if current % 2 == 0:\n            total += current\n        current += 1\n    return total\n\n\ndef main():\n    start_range = 2\n    end_range = 100\n    result = sum_even_numbers(start_range, end_range)\n    print(f\"The sum of even numbers from {start_range} to {end_range} is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a start and end range as input.\n2. Inside the function, we initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of even numbers and a variable `current` to iterate through the range.\n3. We use a while loop to iterate from `start` to `end`.\n4. Within the loop, we check if the current number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, it's an even number.\n5. If the number is even, we add it to the `total` sum.\n6. We increment the `current` variable by 1 to move to the next number in the range.\n7. Once the loop completes, we return the `total` sum.\n8. In the `main` function, we call `sum_even_numbers` with the desired range (2 to 100) and print the result.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nThe sum of even numbers from 2 to 100 is: 2550\n```",
