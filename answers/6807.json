  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and determines whether the student has passed or failed based on a conditional statement. The passing grade is 50. If the student's grade is 50 or above, print 'Passed'. If the grade is below 50, print 'Failed'. Additionally, if the grade is exactly 50, print 'Borderline pass'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int grade;\n    cin >> grade;\n\n    if (grade < 50) {\n        cout << \"Failed\" << endl;\n    } else if (grade > 50) {\n        cout << \"Passed\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Borderline pass\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code takes the input from the user, checks the grade using an if-else statement, and prints out the result based on the conditions specified.",
