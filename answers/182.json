  "answer": "**Secret Number Guessing Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a secret number between 1 and 100, and then uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for input until they correctly guess the secret number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_secret_number():\n    \"\"\"Generate a secret number between 1 and 100.\"\"\"\n    return random.randint(1, 100)\n\ndef get_user_guess():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Guess the secret number: \"))\n            if 1 <= guess <= 100:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    secret_number = get_secret_number()\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while True:\n        user_guess = get_user_guess()\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if user_guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a secret number and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter a whole number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will provide feedback on your guess (e.g., \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\").\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the secret number.\n6. The program will display a congratulatory message with the number of attempts it took you to guess the secret number.\n\n### Tips\n\n* You can adjust the range of the secret number by modifying the `get_secret_number` function.\n* You can add additional features, such as limiting the number of attempts or providing hints, to make the game more challenging or engaging.",
