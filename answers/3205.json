  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and prints their average.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not num_list:\n        return 0\n\n    average = sum(num_list) / len(num_list)\n    return average\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.\n3. The `sum` function is used to add up all the numbers in the list.\n4. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list (`len(num_list)`).\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\nYou can run this program, replace the `numbers` list with your own list of numbers, and it will print their average.",
