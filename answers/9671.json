  "answer": "**Word Reversal Program**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of its words.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the order of words in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sentence with words in reversed order.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into words\n    reversed_sentence = ' '.join(reversed(words))  # Reverse the words and join them back into a sentence\n    return reversed_sentence\n\ndef main():\n    sentence = input(\"Please enter a sentence: \")  # Ask for user input\n    reversed_sentence = reverse_words(sentence)  # Reverse the words in the sentence\n    print(\"Reversed sentence: \", reversed_sentence)  # Print the result\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a sentence when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is Python\").\n3. The program will print the sentence with the words in reversed order (e.g., \"Python is this world Hello\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `split()` method to divide the sentence into words and the `reversed()` function to reverse the order of the words.\n* The `join()` method is used to combine the reversed words back into a sentence.\n* The program handles sentences with any number of words and does not modify punctuation or capitalization.",
