  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and their grades for three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should then calculate the average grade for each student and store it in the dictionary. Finally, the program should print out the dictionary with the student's name, grades, and average grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of grades.\n    \n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades\n    student_grades = {}\n\n    # Prompt the user to input the number of students\n    num_students = int(input(\"Enter the number of students: \"))\n\n    # Loop through each student\n    for _ in range(num_students):\n        # Prompt the user to input the student's name\n        name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n\n        # Prompt the user to input the student's grades\n        math_grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's Math grade: \"))\n        science_grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's Science grade: \"))\n        english_grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's English grade: \"))\n\n        # Calculate the average grade\n        average_grade = calculate_average([math_grade, science_grade, english_grade])\n\n        # Store the student's grades and average grade in the dictionary\n        student_grades[name] = {\n            \"Math\": math_grade,\n            \"Science\": science_grade,\n            \"English\": english_grade,\n            \"Average\": average_grade\n        }\n\n    # Print out the dictionary with the student's name, grades, and average grade\n    for name, grades in student_grades.items():\n        print(f\"Student: {name}\")\n        print(f\"Math Grade: {grades['Math']}\")\n        print(f\"Science Grade: {grades['Science']}\")\n        print(f\"English Grade: {grades['English']}\")\n        print(f\"Average Grade: {grades['Average']:.2f}\")\n        print()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function calculates the average of a list of grades.\n2. In the `main` function, we first initialize an empty dictionary `student_grades` to store the student grades.\n3. We then prompt the user to input the number of students they want to enter grades for.\n4. We loop through each student, prompting the user to input the student's name and grades for Math, Science, and English.\n5. We calculate the average grade using the `calculate_average` function and store it in the dictionary along with the student's grades.\n6. Finally, we print out the dictionary with the student's name, grades, and average grade.\n\nExample use case:\n\n```\nEnter the number of students: 2\nEnter the student's name: John\nEnter the student's Math grade: 90\nEnter the student's Science grade: 85\nEnter the student's English grade: 95\nEnter the student's name: Jane\nEnter the student's Math grade: 80\nEnter the student's Science grade: 90\nEnter the student's English grade: 85\nStudent: John\nMath Grade: 90.0\nScience Grade: 85.0\nEnglish Grade: 95.0\nAverage Grade: 90.00\n\nStudent: Jane\nMath Grade: 80.0\nScience Grade: 90.0\nEnglish Grade: 85.0\nAverage Grade: 85.00\n```",
