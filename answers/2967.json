  "answer": "**Word Occurrence Counter Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a text input from the user, splits it into words, and counts the occurrences of each word. The result is then printed out.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_word_occurrences(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of each word in the given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are words and values are their occurrences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n\n    # Split text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Count word occurrences\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n\n    return word_counts\n\ndef main():\n    # Get text input from user\n    text = input(\"Please enter a text: \")\n\n    # Count word occurrences\n    word_counts = count_word_occurrences(text)\n\n    # Print word occurrences\n    print(\"Word Occurrences:\")\n    for word, count in word_counts.most_common():\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a text (e.g., \"This is a test. This test is only a test.\").\n3. The program will print out the occurrences of each word in the text.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each word.\n* The program converts the text to lowercase to ensure that the same word in different cases is not counted as separate words.\n* The program removes punctuation from the text to ensure that words followed by punctuation are not counted as separate words.",
