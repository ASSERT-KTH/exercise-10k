  "answer": "**Customer Loyalty Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that determines a customer's loyalty status based on their purchase history and membership status.\n\n```python\nclass Customer:\n    def __init__(self, name, membership_status, purchase_history):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Customer object.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The customer's name.\n            membership_status (str): The customer's membership status (e.g., \"Basic\", \"Premium\", \"Elite\").\n            purchase_history (list): A list of the customer's past purchases.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.membership_status = membership_status\n        self.purchase_history = purchase_history\n\n    def determine_loyalty_status(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Determine the customer's loyalty status based on their purchase history and membership status.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The customer's loyalty status (e.g., \"New\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", \"Platinum\").\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.membership_status == \"Basic\" and len(self.purchase_history) < 5:\n            return \"New\"\n        elif self.membership_status == \"Basic\" and len(self.purchase_history) >= 5:\n            return \"Silver\"\n        elif self.membership_status == \"Premium\" and len(self.purchase_history) < 10:\n            return \"Gold\"\n        elif self.membership_status == \"Premium\" and len(self.purchase_history) >= 10:\n            return \"Platinum\"\n        elif self.membership_status == \"Elite\":\n            return \"Platinum\"\n        else:\n            return \"Unknown\"\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a customer with basic membership and 3 purchases\n    customer1 = Customer(\"John Doe\", \"Basic\", [\"Purchase 1\", \"Purchase 2\", \"Purchase 3\"])\n    print(f\"{customer1.name}'s loyalty status: {customer1.determine_loyalty_status()}\")\n\n    # Create a customer with premium membership and 12 purchases\n    customer2 = Customer(\"Jane Doe\", \"Premium\", [\"Purchase 1\", \"Purchase 2\", \"Purchase 3\", \"Purchase 4\", \"Purchase 5\", \"Purchase 6\", \"Purchase 7\", \"Purchase 8\", \"Purchase 9\", \"Purchase 10\", \"Purchase 11\", \"Purchase 12\"])\n    print(f\"{customer2.name}'s loyalty status: {customer2.determine_loyalty_status()}\")\n\n    # Create a customer with elite membership\n    customer3 = Customer(\"Bob Smith\", \"Elite\", [])\n    print(f\"{customer3.name}'s loyalty status: {customer3.determine_loyalty_status()}\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n------------------------\n\n1.  The `Customer` class is defined with attributes for `name`, `membership_status`, and `purchase_history`.\n2.  The `determine_loyalty_status` method uses if/else statements to evaluate the customer's loyalty status based on their `membership_status` and `purchase_history`.\n3.  The loyalty status is determined as follows:\n    *   **New**: Basic membership with fewer than 5 purchases.\n    *   **Silver**: Basic membership with 5 or more purchases.\n    *   **Gold**: Premium membership with fewer than 10 purchases.\n    *   **Platinum**: Premium membership with 10 or more purchases, or elite membership.\n4.  Example usage is provided in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, demonstrating how to create `Customer` objects and determine their loyalty status.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n----------------------\n\n*   You can modify the loyalty status criteria by adjusting the conditions in the `determine_loyalty_status` method.\n*   Consider adding more membership levels or loyalty status tiers to the program.\n*   You can also integrate this program with a database to store customer information and purchase history.\n*   To make the program more interactive, you can add a user interface to input customer data and display their loyalty status.",
