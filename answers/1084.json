It also checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero.\n*   The `main` function gets the dividend and divisor from the user, calculates the quotient using the `calculate_quotient` function, and prints the result.\n*   If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message instead of crashing.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Divide 10 by 2: Enter `10` as the dividend and `2` as the divisor. The program will output `The quotient is: 5.0`.\n*   Divide 10 by 0: Enter `10` as the dividend and `0` as the divisor. The program will output `Cannot divide by zero.`.",
