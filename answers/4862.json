  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\npackage com.example.practice;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int i = 1;\n        int sum = 0;\n        while (i <= 20) {\n            if (i % 2 == 0) {\n                sum += i;\n            }\n            i += 1;\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined in the description:\n\n* It is a Java program with the correct package declaration and class definition.\n* The `main` method is correctly defined, and the variable `i` is initialized to 1 and `sum` to 0.\n* The `while` loop runs from 1 to 20, incrementing `i` by 1 on each iteration.\n* Inside the loop, the code checks if `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`). If it is even, the code adds `i` to the `sum`.\n* After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of even numbers using `System.out.println`.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
