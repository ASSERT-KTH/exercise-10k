  "answer": "**Union of Two Lists Program**\n====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the union of two lists of numbers. The union of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in either set.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef union_of_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the union of two lists of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing all unique elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1 + list2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n    union_list = union_of_lists(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Union of the lists:\", union_list)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `union_of_lists` function takes two lists of numbers as input.\n2. It combines the two lists into one using the `+` operator.\n3. It converts the combined list into a set using the `set()` function, which automatically removes duplicates.\n4. It converts the set back into a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `union_of_lists` function with two example lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nUnion of the lists: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote: The order of elements in the output list may vary because sets are unordered data structures in Python. If you need to preserve the original order of elements, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to create a new list with unique elements.",
