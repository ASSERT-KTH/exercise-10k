  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nHere is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers():\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_numbers()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.\n* The `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n* Inside the loop, the `print(i)` statement prints the current number.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `print_numbers` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n**Output:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```",
