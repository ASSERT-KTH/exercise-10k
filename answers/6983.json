  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input, dividend and divisor, \n    and returns the quotient and remainder.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the divisor is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Divisor cannot be zero.\")\n\n    # Calculate the quotient and remainder\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    # Call the function and print the result\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient and remainder. The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls `divide_numbers`, and prints the result. If the user tries to divide by zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.",
