  "answer": "**Cartesian Product Program**\n================================\n\nThe cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs, where each element of the first set is paired with each element of the second set.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the cartesian product of two arrays:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef cartesian_product(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cartesian product of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is an ordered pair from the cartesian product.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.product(arr1, arr2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n    result = cartesian_product(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Cartesian Product:\")\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `cartesian_product` function takes two arrays as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is an ordered pair from the cartesian product.\n2. The `itertools.product` function is used to calculate the cartesian product. This function returns an iterator that produces tuples, containing the cartesian product of input iterables.\n3. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `cartesian_product` function with two example arrays.\n4. The result is printed to the console, showing the cartesian product of the two input arrays.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output the cartesian product of the two example arrays:\n```\nCartesian Product:\n(1, 'a')\n(1, 'b')\n(1, 'c')\n(2, 'a')\n(2, 'b')\n(2, 'c')\n(3, 'a')\n(3, 'b')\n(3, 'c')\n```\n\nThis output shows the cartesian product of the two input arrays, where each element of the first array is paired with each element of the second array.",
