  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check if n is a negative number\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \"))\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial using recursion.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   If `n` is a negative number, the function raises a `ValueError`.\n*   For any other positive integer `n`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   The `main` function tests the `factorial` function by taking user input and printing the result.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n*   Calculate the factorial of 5: `factorial(5)` returns `120`.\n*   Calculate the factorial of 0: `factorial(0)` returns `1`.\n*   Calculate the factorial of a negative number: `factorial(-1)` raises a `ValueError`.",
