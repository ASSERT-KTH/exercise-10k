  "answer": "**Scramble Word Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function scrambles the letters in a given word. It uses the `random` library to shuffle the characters in the word.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scramble the letters in a given word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to scramble.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the word to a list of characters\n    char_list = list(word)\n    \n    # Shuffle the characters in the list\n    random.shuffle(char_list)\n    \n    # Join the characters back into a string\n    scrambled_word = ''.join(char_list)\n    \n    return scrambled_word\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    word = \"hello\"\n    print(f\"Original word: {word}\")\n    print(f\"Scrambled word: {scramble_word(word)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it to a list of characters.\n2. The `random.shuffle` function is used to shuffle the characters in the list.\n3. The shuffled characters are then joined back into a string using the `join` method.\n4. The scrambled word is returned by the function.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This function does not preserve the original word's case or punctuation.\n* If you need to scramble words while preserving case or punctuation, you will need to modify the function accordingly.\n* This function uses the `random` library, which means the scrambled word will be different each time the function is called.",
