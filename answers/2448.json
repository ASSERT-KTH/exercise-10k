  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and an element as input and returns a new list containing the element inserted at a specified position.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specification:\n```\ninsertAtPosition = (list, element, position) => {\n  const leftList = list.slice(0, position);\n  const rightList = list.slice(position);\n  const newList = [...leftList, element, ...rightList];\n  return newList;\n}\n\nconst list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst position = 2;\nconst element = 10;\nconst newList = insertAtPosition(list, element, position);\nconsole.log(newList); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]\n```\nThis code defines the `insertAtPosition` function, which takes a list, an element, and a position as arguments. It uses array slicing and the spread operator to insert the element at the specified position in the list. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample list, position, and element, and logs the resulting new list to the console.",
