  "answer": "**Random Graph Generation Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that generates a random graph of a specified size. This function uses the NetworkX library, which is a popular library for creating and analyzing complex networks.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef generate_random_graph(num_nodes, num_edges):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a random graph with the specified number of nodes and edges.\n\n    Args:\n    - num_nodes (int): The number of nodes in the graph.\n    - num_edges (int): The number of edges in the graph.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A NetworkX graph object representing the random graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the number of edges is valid\n    if num_edges > num_nodes * (num_nodes - 1) / 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Too many edges for the given number of nodes\")\n\n    # Create an empty graph\n    G = nx.Graph()\n\n    # Add nodes to the graph\n    for i in range(num_nodes):\n        G.add_node(i)\n\n    # Add edges to the graph\n    edges = set()\n    while len(edges) < num_edges:\n        node1 = random.randint(0, num_nodes - 1)\n        node2 = random.randint(0, num_nodes - 1)\n        # Ensure the edge is not self-referential and not already added\n        if node1 != node2 and (node1, node2) not in edges and (node2, node1) not in edges:\n            edges.add((node1, node2))\n            G.add_edge(node1, node2)\n\n    return G\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num_nodes = 10\n    num_edges = 15\n    G = generate_random_graph(num_nodes, num_edges)\n    print(\"Nodes:\", list(G.nodes()))\n    print(\"Edges:\", list(G.edges()))\n\n    # Draw the graph\n    nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)\n    plt.show()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `generate_random_graph` function takes two arguments: `num_nodes` and `num_edges`, which specify the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively.\n*   It first checks if the number of edges is valid. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   It then creates an empty graph using NetworkX and adds the specified number of nodes to the graph.\n*   Next, it adds the specified number of edges to the graph. To avoid self-referential edges and duplicate edges, it uses a set to keep track of the edges that have already been added.\n*   Finally, it returns the generated graph.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n*   This function generates an undirected graph. If you need a directed graph, you can modify the function to use `nx.DiGraph` instead of `nx.Graph`.\n*   The graph is represented as a NetworkX graph object, which provides various methods for analyzing and manipulating the graph.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and draw the generated graph using Matplotlib.",
