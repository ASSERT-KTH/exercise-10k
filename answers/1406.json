  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a password is valid. If the password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit, print 'Valid', otherwise print 'Invalid'.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a password is valid based on the given criteria:\n\n```python\ndef check_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a password is valid.\n    \n    A password is valid if it is at least 8 characters long and contains \n    at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.\n    \n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        print('Invalid')\n        return\n    \n    # Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit\n    if (any(char.isupper() for char in password) \n        and any(char.islower() for char in password) \n        and any(char.isdigit() for char in password)):\n        print('Valid')\n    else:\n        print('Invalid')\n\n# Test the function\npassword = input(\"Enter a password: \")\ncheck_password(password)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `check_password` function checks the length of the password.\n2. If the password is at least 8 characters long, it checks for the presence of at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit using the `any` function and the `isupper`, `islower`, and `isdigit` string methods.\n3. If all conditions are met, it prints 'Valid'; otherwise, it prints 'Invalid'.\n4. The function is then tested with a user-inputted password.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* If the user enters a password that is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit (e.g., \"Password123\"), the program will print 'Valid'.\n* If the user enters a password that is less than 8 characters long or does not contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit (e.g., \"password\" or \"Password\"), the program will print 'Invalid'.",
