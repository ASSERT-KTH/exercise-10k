  "answer": "### Program to Remove Last Key-Value Pair from Dictionary\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses the `popitem()` method to remove the last key-value pair that was added to the dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef remove_last_item(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes the last key-value pair that was added to the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which to remove the last item.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The dictionary with the last item removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the dictionary is empty\n    if not dictionary:\n        print(\"Dictionary is empty.\")\n        return dictionary\n\n    # Use popitem() to remove the last key-value pair\n    removed_item = dictionary.popitem()\n\n    print(f\"Removed item: {removed_item}\")\n    return dictionary\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a dictionary\n    person = {'name': 'Natalie', 'age': 20, 'city': 'Sunshine Coast'}\n\n    print(\"Original dictionary:\")\n    print(person)\n\n    # Remove the last key-value pair\n    updated_person = remove_last_item(person)\n\n    print(\"\\nUpdated dictionary:\")\n    print(updated_person)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `remove_last_item` function takes a dictionary as input and uses the `popitem()` method to remove the last key-value pair that was added.\n*   The `popitem()` method returns the removed key-value pair, which is then printed to the console.\n*   The updated dictionary is returned by the function.\n*   In the `main` function, we create a dictionary representing a person and print the original dictionary.\n*   We then call the `remove_last_item` function to remove the last key-value pair and print the updated dictionary.\n\n### Note\n\n*   The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last key-value pair that was added to the dictionary. In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain their insertion order. However, in earlier versions of Python, the order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed.\n*   If the dictionary is empty, the `popitem()` method raises a `KeyError`. To handle this case, we check if the dictionary is empty before calling `popitem()`.",
