  "answer": "### Traffic Light Simulator\n#### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a traffic light with three states: Red, Yellow, and Green. The user can change the state of the light by entering the corresponding command.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nclass TrafficLight:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.states = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green']\n        self.current_state = self.states[0]\n\n    def change_state(self, state):\n        if state in self.states:\n            self.current_state = state\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid state. Please enter 'Red', 'Yellow', or 'Green'.\")\n\n    def print_state(self):\n        print(self.current_state)\n\n\ndef main():\n    light = TrafficLight()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Change state\")\n        print(\"2. Print current state\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        if choice == '1':\n            print(\"\\nAvailable states:\")\n            for i, state in enumerate(light.states):\n                print(f\"{i+1}. {state}\")\n            state_choice = input(\"Enter the number of your desired state: \")\n            try:\n                state_choice = int(state_choice)\n                if 1 <= state_choice <= 3:\n                    light.change_state(light.states[state_choice - 1])\n                else:\n                    print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 3.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number.\")\n        elif choice == '2':\n            light.print_state()\n        elif choice == '3':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 3.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option:\n\t* `1` to change the state of the traffic light.\n\t* `2` to print the current state of the traffic light.\n\t* `3` to exit the program.\n3. If you choose to change the state, select the desired state by entering the corresponding number.\n4. The program will update the state of the traffic light and print the new state if you choose to print it.",
