Run the program.\n2. Choose to play as X or O by entering X or O when prompted.\n3. Enter your move by typing a number from 1 to 9, where 1 is the top left corner and 9 is the bottom right corner.\n4. The computer will make its move after your turn.\n5. Keep playing until someone wins or it's a tie.",
