Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: A 2D array `dp` is created to store the lengths of common subsequences between `str1` and `str2`. The array is initialized with zeros and has dimensions `(len(str1) + 1) x (len(str2) + 1)`.\n2.  **Dynamic Programming**: The solution iterates over the characters in both strings using nested loops. For each pair of characters, it checks if they match. If they do, the length of the common subsequence is increased by 1. Otherwise, it takes the maximum length from the previous characters.\n3.  **Backtracking**: After filling the `dp` array, the solution backtracks to construct the longest common subsequence. It starts from the bottom-right corner of the array and moves diagonally up-left if the characters match, or up/down based on the maximum value in the adjacent cells.\n4.  **LCS Construction**: The characters that match during backtracking are added to the `lcs` list. Finally, the list is reversed to obtain the correct order of the longest common subsequence.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n \\* m), for the `dp` array.\n\nThe solution has a time complexity of O(n \\* m) and a space complexity of O(n \\* m), making it efficient for finding the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming.",
