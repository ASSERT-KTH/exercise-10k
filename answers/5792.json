  "answer": "### Anagram Checker Function\n#### Overview\nThis function checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. It does this by sorting the characters in each string and comparing the results. If the sorted characters are equal, then the original strings are anagrams.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string to check.\n        str2 (str): The second string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort the characters in each string and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Listen\", \"Silent\"))  # True\n    print(are_anagrams(\"Hello\", \"World\"))  # False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function first removes any whitespace from the input strings and converts them to lowercase. This is to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores any spaces.\n2. It then checks if the lengths of the strings are equal. If they are not, the function immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n3. If the lengths are equal, the function sorts the characters in each string and compares the results. If the sorted characters are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the original strings are anagrams. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the `sorted` function in Python uses a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n), as the function creates new sorted lists of characters.",
