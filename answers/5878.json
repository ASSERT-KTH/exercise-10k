  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generation**\n=====================================\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\nHere is a Python function to generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(fibonacci(n))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The function `fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.\n2. The base cases are handled first: if `n` is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned; if `n` is 1 or 2, the list `[0]` or `[0, 1]` is returned, respectively.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, the list `fib_sequence` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `[0, 1]`.\n4. The `while` loop appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the list until the length of the list reaches `n`.\n5. The completed Fibonacci sequence is returned as a list.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: `fibonacci(10)`\n* Generate the first 20 Fibonacci numbers: `fibonacci(20)`",
