  "answer": "**Finding the Difference Between Two Dictionaries**\n\nYou can find the difference between two dictionaries using Python's built-in dictionary methods. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n### Method 1: Using Dictionary Comprehension\n\n```python\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with keys that are in dict1 but not in dict2, or have different values.\"\"\"\n    return {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key not in dict2 or dict1[key] != dict2[key]}\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'd': 4}\nprint(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using the `set` Data Structure\n\n```python\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with keys that are in dict1 but not in dict2, or have different values.\"\"\"\n    diff = {}\n    for key in set(dict1) - set(dict2):\n        diff[key] = dict1[key]\n    for key in set(dict1) & set(dict2):\n        if dict1[key] != dict2[key]:\n            diff[key] = dict1[key]\n    return diff\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'd': 4}\nprint(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using the `deepdiff` Library\n\nYou can also use the `deepdiff` library, which provides a more comprehensive way of comparing dictionaries.\n\nFirst, install the library using pip:\n```bash\npip install deepdiff\n```\n\nThen, use the library as follows:\n```python\nimport deepdiff\n\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with keys that are in dict1 but not in dict2, or have different values.\"\"\"\n    return deepdiff.DeepDiff(dict1, dict2)\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'd': 4}\nprint(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n# Output: {'dictionary_item_added': {'root.d': 4}, 'dictionary_item_removed': ['c'], 'values_changed': {'root.b': {'new_value': 3, 'old_value': 2}}}\n```\n\nNote that the `deepdiff` library returns a more detailed report of the differences between the two dictionaries, including added and removed items, as well as changed values.",
