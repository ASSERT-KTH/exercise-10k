  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following code defines a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        # Swap a and b, and replace b with the remainder of a divided by b\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)  # Return the absolute value of the GCD\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n*   The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.\n*   At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.\n*   The function returns the absolute value of the GCD to ensure it is always non-negative.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is O(log min(a, b)), making it efficient for large inputs.",
