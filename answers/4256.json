After entering the required information, it will print the updated budget.\n\n```\nEnter your income: $5000\nEnter the number of expenses: 3\nEnter expense 1: $1000\nEnter expense 2: $1500\nEnter expense 3: $200\nEnter the budget type (e.g., 'monthly', 'yearly', etc.): monthly\nBudget Type: monthly\nIncome: $5000.00\nExpenses:\n  1. $1000.00\n  2. $1500.00\n  3. $200.00\nTotal Expenses: $2700.00\nRemaining Balance: $2300.00\n```",
