  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that uses a for loop to generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    \n    # Create a list to store the Fibonacci numbers\n    fibonacci_sequence = [a, b]\n    \n    # Generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers\n    for _ in range(2, n):\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two\n        next_number = a + b\n        \n        # Update the previous two numbers for the next iteration\n        a, b = b, next_number\n        \n        # Append the new Fibonacci number to the list\n        fibonacci_sequence.append(next_number)\n    \n    return fibonacci_sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"The first {n} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:\")\n    print(generate_fibonacci(n))\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a = 0` and `b = 1`.\n*   We create a list `fibonacci_sequence` to store the generated Fibonacci numbers, initializing it with the first two numbers.\n*   We use a for loop to generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers. In each iteration, we calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two (`next_number = a + b`).\n*   We update the previous two numbers for the next iteration by shifting `b` to `a` and `next_number` to `b`.\n*   We append the new Fibonacci number to the `fibonacci_sequence` list.\n*   Finally, we return the `fibonacci_sequence` list containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
