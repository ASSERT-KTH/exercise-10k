  "answer": "**Subsequence Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if one string is a subsequence of another. A subsequence is a new string that can be formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(s1, s2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if s1 is a subsequence of s2.\n    \n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The potential subsequence.\n        s2 (str): The original string.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s1 is a subsequence of s2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0  # Index for s1\n    j = 0  # Index for s2\n    \n    while i < len(s1) and j < len(s2):\n        if s1[i] == s2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        j += 1\n    \n    return i == len(s1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    s1 = \"abc\"\n    s2 = \"ahbgdc\"\n    print(f\"Is '{s1}' a subsequence of '{s2}'? {is_subsequence(s1, s2)}\")\n\n    s1 = \"axc\"\n    s2 = \"ahbgdc\"\n    print(f\"Is '{s1}' a subsequence of '{s2}'? {is_subsequence(s1, s2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_subsequence` function takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.\n2. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to traverse `s1` and `s2` respectively.\n3. The function enters a while loop that continues until `i` reaches the end of `s1` or `j` reaches the end of `s2`.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current characters at `s1[i]` and `s2[j]` are equal. If they are, it increments `i`.\n5. Regardless of whether the characters match, it increments `j` to move to the next character in `s2`.\n6. After the loop, it checks if `i` has reached the end of `s1`. If it has, it means that all characters in `s1` have been found in `s2` in the correct order, so it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The string \"abc\" is a subsequence of \"ahbgdc\" because the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' appear in that order in \"ahbgdc\".\n* The string \"axc\" is not a subsequence of \"ahbgdc\" because the characters 'a', 'x', and 'c' do not appear in that order in \"ahbgdc\".",
