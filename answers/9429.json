  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers using type hinting for input and output types. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of a list of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list[int]): A list of integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the integers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0. This variable will store the sum of the numbers in the list.\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list.\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Add the current number to the total sum.\n        total_sum += num\n    \n    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list.\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(sum_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `sum_numbers` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns their sum as an integer. This is achieved by using type hinting to specify the input and output types.\n*   Inside the function, a variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of the numbers in the list. A for loop is then used to iterate over each number `num` in the list, adding it to `total_sum`.\n*   After iterating over all numbers, the function returns `total_sum`, which holds the total sum of the integers in the list.\n*   The code includes a test case where a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is passed to the `sum_numbers` function, and the result is printed, demonstrating the function's usage and correctness.",
