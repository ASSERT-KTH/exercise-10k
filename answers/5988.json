  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n====================================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, sums them up, and then divides by the total count of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the input numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_average` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list and the `len` function to get the count of numbers.\n4. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n5. In the example usage, we create a list of numbers, calculate their average, and print the result.",
