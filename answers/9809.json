  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's name, age, and location as input and then prints out a greeting message with the user's information. The program should handle invalid inputs and ensure that the age is a positive integer.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport re\n\ndef get_input():\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    location = input(\"Please enter your location: \")\n    return name, age, location\n\ndef validate_input(name, age, location):\n    if not name:\n        print(\"Error: Name cannot be empty.\")\n        return False\n    if not age:\n        print(\"Error: Age cannot be empty.\")\n        return False\n    if not location:\n        print(\"Error: Location cannot be empty.\")\n        return False\n    if not age.isdigit():\n        print(\"Error: Age must be a whole number.\")\n        return False\n    if int(age) <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: Age must be a positive number.\")\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef process(name, age, location):\n    greeting = f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and from {location}.\"\n    return greeting\n\ndef main():\n    name, age, location = get_input()\n    if validate_input(name, age, location):\n        greeting = process(name, age, location)\n        print(greeting)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications and implemented the code as described. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any modifications!",
