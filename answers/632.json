  "answer": "**Travel Time Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the time it takes to travel a certain distance given the speed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_travel_time(distance, speed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the time it takes to travel a certain distance given the speed.\n\n    Args:\n    distance (float): The distance to travel (in kilometers or miles).\n    speed (float): The speed of travel (in kilometers per hour or miles per hour).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The time it takes to travel the distance (in hours).\n    \"\"\"\n    if speed <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Speed must be greater than zero.\")\n    if distance < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Distance cannot be negative.\")\n    travel_time = distance / speed\n    return travel_time\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance to travel (in kilometers or miles): \"))\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed of travel (in kilometers per hour or miles per hour): \"))\n\n    # Calculate travel time\n    try:\n        travel_time = calculate_travel_time(distance, speed)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n        return\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The time it takes to travel {distance} kilometers/miles at a speed of {speed} kilometers/miles per hour is {travel_time:.2f} hours.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance to travel (e.g., 100).\n3. Enter the speed of travel (e.g., 50).\n4. The program will print the calculated travel time.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the formula `time = distance / speed` to calculate the travel time.\n* It checks for invalid input (speed less than or equal to zero, distance less than zero) and raises a `ValueError` if encountered.\n* The result is printed with two decimal places.",
