  "prompt": "Create a program that counts the number of lines in a given text using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that counts the number of lines in a given text using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef count_lines(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of lines in a given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of lines in the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    line_count = 0\n    for line in text.split('\\n'):\n        line_count += 1\n    return line_count\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"\"\"This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is the third line.\"\"\"\nprint(count_lines(text))\n```\n\nThis program works by splitting the input text into a list of lines using the `split('\\n')` method, and then iterating over this list with a for loop, incrementing a counter variable for each line. The final value of the counter variable is the number of lines in the text.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more concise version:\n\n```python\ndef count_lines(text):\n    return len(text.split('\\n'))\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"\"\"This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is the third line.\"\"\"\nprint(count_lines(text))\n```\n\nThis version uses the `len()` function to directly count the number of lines in the list returned by `split('\\n')`.",
