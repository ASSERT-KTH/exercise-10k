  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n        return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 10\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {num}: {fibonacci(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n2. The base cases are handled first:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned.\n   - If `n` is 1, a list containing only 0 is returned.\n   - If `n` is 2, a list containing 0 and 1 is returned.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, the Fibonacci sequence is generated iteratively:\n   - The sequence is initialized with the first two numbers, 0 and 1.\n   - A while loop is used to append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence until the desired length is reached.\n4. The generated Fibonacci sequence is then returned.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
