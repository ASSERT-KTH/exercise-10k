  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nnum_terms = 10\nfib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(num_terms)\nprint(f\"The Fibonacci sequence with {num_terms} terms is: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1.  The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2.  It handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, returning an empty list, a list with a single element (0), or a list with two elements (0 and 1), respectively.\n3.  For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0 and 1) and then enters a loop to generate the remaining terms.\n4.  Inside the loop, it appends the sum of the last two terms in the sequence to the end of the list, effectively generating the next term in the Fibonacci sequence.\n5.  The loop continues until the length of the Fibonacci sequence reaches the desired number of terms `n`.\n6.  Finally, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence as a list of integers.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program with `num_terms = 10`, it will output:\n\n```\nThe Fibonacci sequence with 10 terms is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\nThis output shows the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. You can adjust the value of `num_terms` to generate the sequence with a different number of terms.",
