  "prompt": "Write a program to take a user's name and age as input and print a formatted string with their name and age.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_name_and_age():\n    # Get user's name and age as input\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n\n    # Print a formatted string with their name and age\n    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n\n# Call the function\nprint_name_and_age()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `print_name_and_age` that prompts the user to enter their name and age. The `input` function in Python is used to get user input. We store the user's input in the `name` and `age` variables.\n\nThen, we use a formatted string (f-string) to print a greeting message with the user's name and age. The `f` before the string indicates that it's a formatted string, and the values inside the curly brackets are replaced with the values of the variables.\n\nFinally, we call the `print_name_and_age` function to execute the program. \n\nExample use case:\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n```",
