  "answer": "**Counting Element Occurrences in a List**\n==============================================\n\nHere's a Python function to count the occurrences of a specified element in a given list of integers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_element_occurrences(lst, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a specified element in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of integers.\n        target (int): The element to be counted.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the target element.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or the target is not an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(lst, list) or not isinstance(target, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Invalid input type\")\n\n    return lst.count(target)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\n    target_element = 2\n    count = count_element_occurrences(numbers, target_element)\n    print(f\"The element {target_element} occurs {count} times in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `count_element_occurrences` takes two arguments: `lst` (the list of integers) and `target` (the element to be counted).\n*   It checks if the input is a list and the target is an integer, raising a `TypeError` if not.\n*   It uses the built-in `count` method of Python lists to count the occurrences of the target element.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample list and target element.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because the `count` method iterates over the entire list.\n*   For large lists, a more efficient approach might be to use a dictionary or a `Counter` object from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of all elements in a single pass.",
