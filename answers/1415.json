  "answer": "**Lottery Number Generator**\n================================\n\nThis program generates a random set of numbers for a lottery draw. If the user inputs the number of draws, it generates that many sets of numbers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_lottery_numbers(num_draws, num_balls, max_ball):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a random set of numbers for a lottery draw.\n\n    Args:\n        num_draws (int): The number of draws to generate.\n        num_balls (int): The number of balls to draw each time.\n        max_ball (int): The maximum number on the balls.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a set of numbers for a lottery draw.\n    \"\"\"\n    lottery_numbers = []\n    for _ in range(num_draws):\n        draw = random.sample(range(1, max_ball + 1), num_balls)\n        draw.sort()\n        lottery_numbers.append(draw)\n    return lottery_numbers\n\ndef main():\n    num_draws = int(input(\"Enter the number of draws: \"))\n    num_balls = int(input(\"Enter the number of balls to draw each time: \"))\n    max_ball = int(input(\"Enter the maximum number on the balls: \"))\n\n    lottery_numbers = generate_lottery_numbers(num_draws, num_balls, max_ball)\n\n    print(\"Lottery Numbers:\")\n    for i, draw in enumerate(lottery_numbers):\n        print(f\"Draw {i+1}: {draw}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of draws: `5`\n3. Enter the number of balls to draw each time: `6`\n4. Enter the maximum number on the balls: `49`\n5. The program will generate and print 5 sets of 6 numbers each, like this:\n```\nLottery Numbers:\nDraw 1: [3, 11, 23, 31, 37, 42]\nDraw 2: [2, 5, 13, 25, 36, 46]\nDraw 3: [1, 9, 17, 28, 32, 44]\nDraw 4: [4, 10, 20, 29, 38, 41]\nDraw 5: [6, 12, 22, 30, 35, 48]\n```\n\n### Notes\n* This program uses the `random.sample` function to generate a random set of unique numbers for each draw.\n* The `random.sample` function ensures that the numbers are unique within each draw.\n* The `sort` method is used to sort the numbers in each draw in ascending order.\n* The program uses a loop to generate the specified number of draws.\n* The program prints the generated lottery numbers in a readable format.",
