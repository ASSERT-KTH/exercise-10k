  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a sequence of numbers as input, and prints 'Increasing' if the sequence is increasing, 'Decreasing' if the sequence is decreasing, and 'Neither' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\na = input()\n\nb = a.split()\nc = list(map(int, b))\n\nif len(c) == 1:\n    print(\"Neither\")\nelse:\n    d = [i > i - 1 for i in c[1:]]\n    e = [i < i - 1 for i in c[1:]]\n\n    if all(d):\n        print(\"Increasing\")\n    elif all(e):\n        print(\"Decreasing\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Neither\")\n```\nI've carefully followed the explanation and written the code accordingly.",
