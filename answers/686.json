  "answer": "**Modulus Operator Program**\n====================================\n\nThis program takes two integers as input and calculates the remainder of their division using the modulus operator.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    remainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_remainder` function takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, as input.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n3. If the `divisor` is not zero, it calculates the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_remainder` function with example values.\n5. The program prints the remainder of the division operation.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the remainder of 17 divided by 5: `calculate_remainder(17, 5)` returns `2`.\n* Calculate the remainder of 10 divided by 2: `calculate_remainder(10, 2)` returns `0`.\n* Attempting to calculate the remainder of 10 divided by 0 raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.",
