  "answer": "**Age Validation Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their age and validates that it is a positive integer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_valid_age():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for their age and validates that it is a positive integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The user's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age > 0:\n                return age\n            else:\n                print(\"Age must be a positive integer. Please try again.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef main():\n    age = get_valid_age()\n    print(f\"Your age is: {age}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_valid_age` function uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for their age until a valid input is provided.\n2. The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input to an integer using `int(input(...))`.\n3. If the input is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` exception is raised, and the program prints an error message.\n4. If the input is a valid integer, the program checks if it is positive. If not, it prints an error message.\n5. Once a valid positive integer is entered, the function returns the age.\n6. The `main` function calls `get_valid_age` to get the user's age and prints it to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a valid age (e.g., 25).\n* Run the program and enter an invalid age (e.g., -1, abc).\n* Run the program and enter a non-integer value (e.g., 25.5).",
