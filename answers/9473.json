  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their respective grades as input. The program should then calculate the average grade and print out the student names with their grades, along with the average grade. If a student's grade is above the average, mark it as 'Above Average', if it's below the average, mark it as 'Below Average', and if it's equal to the average, mark it as 'Average'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade and print out the student names with their grades,\n    along with the average grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary of student names and their respective grades.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all grades\n    total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n\n    # Print the average grade\n    print(f\"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n    # Print each student's name, grade, and their status compared to the average\n    for student, grade in grades.items():\n        if grade > average_grade:\n            status = 'Above Average'\n        elif grade < average_grade:\n            status = 'Below Average'\n        else:\n            status = 'Average'\n\n        print(f\"{student}: {grade:.2f} - {status}\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"John\": 85,\n    \"Alice\": 90,\n    \"Bob\": 78,\n    \"Charlie\": 92,\n    \"David\": 88\n}\n\ncalculate_average_grade(grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a dictionary `grades` where the keys are student names and the values are their respective grades.\n*   It calculates the sum of all grades using the `sum` function and then calculates the average grade by dividing the sum by the total number of students.\n*   It prints the average grade.\n*   It then iterates over each student and their grade in the `grades` dictionary. For each student, it checks if their grade is above, below, or equal to the average grade and assigns a status accordingly.\n*   Finally, it prints each student's name, grade, and their status compared to the average grade.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nThe provided example usage demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_grade` function with a dictionary of student names and their respective grades. You can replace the `grades` dictionary with your own data to calculate the average grade and compare individual grades for a different set of students.",
