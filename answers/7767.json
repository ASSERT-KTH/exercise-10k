The program will print `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `-` or `subtraction` as the operation. The program will print `10 - 5 = 5.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` or `multiplication` as the operation. The program will print `10 * 5 = 50.0`.\n*   Division: Enter `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` or `division` as the operation. The program will print `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
