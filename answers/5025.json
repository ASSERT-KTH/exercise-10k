  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Initialize the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    \n    # Print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence\n    for i in range(n):\n        print(a, end=\" \")\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The first {n} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:\")\nprint_fibonacci(n)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`. You can change the value of `n` to print a different number of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `print_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n2. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0.\n3. It initializes the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1, respectively.\n4. The function uses a for loop to print the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. In each iteration, it prints the current value of `a` and updates `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence.\n5. The `end=\" \"` argument in the `print` function is used to print the numbers on the same line, separated by spaces.\n\n### Time complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of Fibonacci numbers to print. This is because the program uses a single loop to print the numbers, and the number of iterations is proportional to the input size.",
