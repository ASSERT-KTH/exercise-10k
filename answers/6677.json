  "answer": "**Calculating the Volume of a Sphere**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) \\* \u03c0 \\* r^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sphere_volume(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = 5.0  # in units (e.g., meters, inches)\n    volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)\n    print(f\"The volume of the sphere with radius {radius} is {volume:.2f} cubic units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_sphere_volume` function takes the radius of the sphere as input and calculates its volume using the formula.\n2. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_sphere_volume` function with an example radius.\n3. The `math.pi` constant is used for the value of pi.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The radius should be a non-negative value.\n* The volume is calculated in cubic units (e.g., cubic meters, cubic inches).\n* The result is printed with two decimal places for readability.",
