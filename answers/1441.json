  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int or float): The first number.\n        b (int or float): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int or float: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(a, b)\n    print(f\"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum_of_numbers}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `add_numbers` function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calculates their sum using the `add_numbers` function, and prints the result.\n\nTo run this program, save it in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `sum_of_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python sum_of_numbers.py`). Then, follow the prompts to enter the two numbers. The program will print their sum.",
