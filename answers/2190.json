  "prompt": "Create a function to remove all vowels from a given string. The function should return the string without vowels.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that removes all vowels from a given string, explaining the process and providing a clear understanding of the solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_vowels(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function removes all vowels from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string from which vowels are to be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The input string without vowels.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we define the vowels in both lower and upper case\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n\n    # Then, we use a list comprehension to generate a new string without vowels\n    # We iterate over each character in the input string\n    # If the character is not a vowel, we include it in the new string\n    no_vowels = [char for char in input_string if char not in vowels]\n\n    # Finally, we join the characters in the list back into a string\n    # We use the join() method, which concatenates all the characters in the list\n    result = ''.join(no_vowels)\n\n    # We return the resulting string\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(remove_vowels('Hello World'))  # Output: 'Hll Wrld'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_vowels` starts by defining all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) in the `vowels` string, which serves as a reference for identifying characters to be removed.\n* It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `char` in the `input_string`, including the character in the `no_vowels` list only if it is not found in the `vowels` string.\n* The characters in the `no_vowels` list are then joined back into a single string using the `join()` method, effectively reconstructing the input string without vowels.\n* Finally, the function returns the resulting string, which is the input string with all vowels removed.",
