  "prompt": "Write a function that returns a list of all keys in a dictionary.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll provide you with a function that retrieves all keys from a given dictionary, along with a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef get_dict_keys(dictionary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all keys in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The input dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of all keys in the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a dictionary\")\n\n    # We use the built-in dictionary method keys() to get a view object that displays a list of all keys available in the dictionary\n    keys_view = dictionary.keys()\n\n    # We convert the view object to a list using the list() function\n    # This is because the problem statement asks for a list, and the keys() method returns a view object\n    keys_list = list(keys_view)\n\n    # Finally, we return the list of keys\n    return keys_list\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\nprint(get_dict_keys(my_dict))  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_dict_keys` starts by validating the input using `isinstance(dictionary, dict)`, ensuring it's a dictionary to avoid potential errors.\n* It then utilizes the built-in `dictionary.keys()` method to obtain a view object containing all the dictionary's keys.\n* This view object is converted to a list using the `list()` function and stored in `keys_list`, as the problem requires a list as output.\n* Finally, the function returns `keys_list`, which contains all the keys from the input dictionary.",
