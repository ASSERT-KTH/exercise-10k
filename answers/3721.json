  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a greeting message with their name.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string name;\n    cout << \"Enter your name: \";\n    cin >> name;\n    cout << \"Hello, \" << name << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've followed the specification exactly, including the `using namespace std;` directive, which allows us to use standard library functions without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
