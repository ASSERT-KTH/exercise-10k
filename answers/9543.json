  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function that takes two arguments, num1 and num2\ndef arithmetic(num1, num2):\n    # Perform arithmetic operations\n    addition = num1 + num2\n    subtraction = num1 - num2\n    multiplication = num1 * num2\n    division = num1 / num2\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Addition:\", addition)\n    print(\"Subtraction:\", subtraction)\n    print(\"Multiplication:\", multiplication)\n    print(\"Division:\", division)\n\n# Call the function with two arguments\narithmetic(5, 3)\n```\nThis code defines a function `arithmetic` that takes two arguments `num1` and `num2`, performs the four basic arithmetic operations, prints the results, and calls the function with the arguments `5` and `3`.",
