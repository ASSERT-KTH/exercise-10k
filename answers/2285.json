  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n==========================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The user can play against the computer, and the computer's choice is randomly generated.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate the computer's choice randomly.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    else:\n        return 'computer'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\"\"\"\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer's choice: {computer_choice}\")\n\n    winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    if winner == 'tie':\n        print(f\"It's a tie! Both chose {user_choice}.\")\n    elif winner == 'user':\n        print(f\"You win! {user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Computer wins! {computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = 'yes'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'yes':\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again?
