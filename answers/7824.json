  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operations can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation. Can be '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be '+', '-', '*', or '/'\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the operation, and returns the result.\n*   The function uses if-elif statements to determine which operation to perform based on the input operation.\n*   If the operation is '/', it checks if the second number is zero to prevent a division by zero error.\n*   If the operation is not one of the four basic arithmetic operations, it raises a ValueError.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program also includes error handling to catch and print any errors that may occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Input `2` as the first number, `3` as the second number, and `+` as the operation. The program will output `2 + 3 = 5.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Input `5` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `-` as the operation. The program will output `5 - 2 = 3.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Input `4` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `*` as the operation. The program will output `4 * 5 = 20.0`.\n*   Division: Input `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `/` as the operation. The program will output `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
