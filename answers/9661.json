Run the program.\n2. Enter a sentence when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is a test\").\n3. The program will print out the first word of the sentence (e.g., \"Hello\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses the `split()` method to split the sentence into words.\n* It checks if the sentence is empty to avoid index errors.\n* The `main()` function serves as the program's entry point, handling user input and output.",
