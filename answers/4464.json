  "prompt": "Write a program to print the first N Fibonacci numbers using a while loop",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the first N Fibonacci numbers using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the first N Fibonacci numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    \n    # Initialize a counter\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Print the first N Fibonacci numbers\n    while i < n:\n        print(a, end=\" \")\n        \n        # Update the Fibonacci numbers\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        \n        # Increment the counter\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to print: \"))\nprint_fibonacci(n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1, respectively.\n2. **While Loop**: We use a while loop to print the first N Fibonacci numbers. The loop condition is `i < n`, where `i` is a counter variable.\n3. **Printing**: Inside the loop, we print the current value of `a`.\n4. **Updating**: We update the values of `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation `a, b = b, a + b`.\n5. **Counter Increment**: We increment the counter `i` by 1.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to print. For example, if you enter `10`, the program will print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:\n\n```\nEnter the number of Fibonacci numbers to print: 10\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\n```\n\nNote: This program uses a simple iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers, which is efficient for small values of N. For larger values of N, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the matrix exponentiation method or the fast doubling method.",
