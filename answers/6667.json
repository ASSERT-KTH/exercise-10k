  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the simple interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money invested.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest earned.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate simple interest\n    interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Simple Interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${principal + interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount: `$1000`\n3. Enter the interest rate: `5`\n4. Enter the time period: `2`\n5. The program will calculate and display the simple interest and total amount.\n\nOutput:\n```\nSimple Interest Calculator\n---------------------------\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nSimple Interest: $100.00\nTotal Amount: $1100.00\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_simple_interest` function takes in the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as arguments.\n2. It calculates the simple interest using the formula: `interest = principal * rate * time`.\n3. The `main` function gets user input for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n4. It calls the `calculate_simple_interest` function to calculate the simple interest.\n5. Finally, it prints the simple interest and total amount to the user.",
