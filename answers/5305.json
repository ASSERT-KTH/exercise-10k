  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Simulator**\n=====================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players. It takes the choices of both players as input and returns the winner of the game.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef rock_paper_scissors(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players.\n\n    Args:\n        player1 (str): The choice of player 1. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n        player2 (str): The choice of player 2. Can be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The winner of the game. Can be 'player1', 'player2', or 'tie'.\n    \"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    if player1 not in choices or player2 not in choices:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid choice. Must be 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\")\n\n    if player1 == player2:\n        return 'tie'\n    elif (player1 == 'rock' and player2 == 'scissors') or \\\n         (player1 == 'scissors' and player2 == 'paper') or \\\n         (player1 == 'paper' and player2 == 'rock'):\n        return 'player1'\n    else:\n        return 'player2'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Plays a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    player1 = input(\"Enter player 1's choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n    player2 = input(\"Enter player 2's choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n    winner = rock_paper_scissors(player1.lower(), player2.lower())\n    if winner == 'tie':\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n    elif winner == 'player1':\n        print(\"Player 1 wins!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Player 2 wins!\")\n\ndef play_computer_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Plays a game of rock, paper, scissors between a player and the computer.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    player = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n    computer = random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer}\")\n    winner = rock_paper_scissors(player.lower(), computer)\n    if winner == 'tie':\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n    elif winner == 'player1':\n        print(\"You win!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Computer wins!\")\n\n# Example usage:\nplay_game()\nplay_computer_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `rock_paper_scissors` function takes the choices of two players as input and returns the winner of the game. It first checks if the choices are valid, and if not, raises a `ValueError`. It then checks for a tie, and if not, determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n\nThe `play_game` function plays a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players. It prompts the users for their choices, calls the `rock_paper_scissors` function to determine the winner, and prints the result.\n\nThe `play_computer_game` function plays a game of rock, paper, scissors between a player and the computer. It prompts the user for their choice, generates a random choice for the computer, calls the `rock_paper_scissors` function to determine the winner, and prints the result.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the code, simply call the `play_game` or `play_computer_game` function. The functions will prompt the users for their choices and print the result of the game.",
