  "answer": "**Anagram Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks whether two given words are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(word1, word2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks whether two given words are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        word1 (str): The first word to compare.\n        word2 (str): The second word to compare.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the words are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both words to lowercase and remove any whitespace\n    word1 = word1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    word2 = word2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if the sorted letters of both words are equal\n    return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    word1 = \"listen\"\n    word2 = \"silent\"\n    print(f\"Are '{word1}' and '{word2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(word1, word2)}\")\n\n    word1 = \"hello\"\n    word2 = \"world\"\n    print(f\"Are '{word1}' and '{word2}' anagrams? {are_anagrams(word1, word2)}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `are_anagrams` function takes two words as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It first converts both words to lowercase and removes any whitespace to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores spaces.\n3. It then sorts the letters of both words and checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, the words are anagrams.\n4. The `main` function provides example usage of the `are_anagrams` function.\n\n### Output\n```\nAre 'listen' and 'silent' anagrams? True\nAre 'hello' and 'world' anagrams? False\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input words. For very large input words, a more efficient algorithm may be necessary.",
