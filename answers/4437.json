  "answer": "**Chatbot Program**\n====================\n### Description\n\nThis program simulates a simple chatbot that responds to basic user queries. It uses a while loop to continuously handle user input until the user decides to quit.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary of possible responses\nresponses = {\n    \"hello\": [\"Hi, how are you?\", \"Hello! What's up?\", \"Hey, how's it going?\"],\n    \"how are you\": [\"I'm good, thanks!\", \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking!\", \"I'm just a chatbot, I don't have feelings.\"],\n    \"what's your name\": [\"I'm a chatbot, I don't have a name.\", \"You can call me Bot.\", \"I'm an AI, I don't have a personal name.\"],\n    \"quit\": [\"Goodbye!\", \"See you later!\", \"It was nice chatting with you.\"]\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Return a random response based on the user's input.\"\"\"\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return random.choice(responses[key])\n    return \"I didn't understand that. Please try again.\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Chatbot: \", get_response(user_input))\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Chatbot: \", get_response(user_input))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Type a message, such as \"hello\" or \"how are you\".\n3. The chatbot will respond with a random message.\n4. Continue chatting with the chatbot until you type \"quit\" to exit.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple dictionary to store possible responses to user queries.\n* The `get_response` function returns a random response based on the user's input.\n* The `main` function uses a while loop to continuously handle user input until the user types \"quit\" to exit.",
