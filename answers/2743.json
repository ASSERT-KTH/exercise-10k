  "answer": "**Circle Area Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a circle given its radius. The formula used to calculate the area is `A = \u03c0r^2`, where `A` is the area and `r` is the radius.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The area of the circle is {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_circle_area` function takes a `radius` as input and returns the calculated area.\n2. The function checks if the `radius` is negative, and if so, raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The area is calculated using the formula `A = \u03c0r^2`, where `math.pi` is used for the value of \u03c0.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle, calculates the area using the `calculate_circle_area` function, and prints the result.\n5. The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any `ValueError` exceptions that may be raised.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nRun the program and enter a radius of 5:\n```\nEnter the radius of the circle: 5\nThe area of the circle is 78.54\n```",
