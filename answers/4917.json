  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a starting number and a sequence length as input and prints the corresponding sequence of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int start, length, i;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the starting number: \";\n    cin >> start;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the sequence length: \";\n    cin >> length;\n\n    for (i = 1; i <= length; i++) {\n        cout << start << endl;\n        start = start + 2;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that the code matches the requirements. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
