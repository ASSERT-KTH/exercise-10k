  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter any integer: \"))\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(number, \"x\", i, \"=\", number * i)\n```\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. Asks the user to enter an integer using the `input()` function.\n2. Converts the user's input to an integer using the `int()` function and stores it in the `number` variable.\n3. Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 (inclusive), with the loop variable `i` taking on the values 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.\n4. Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication table for the input `number`, with the multiplier `i`, using the `print()` function. The output is in the format \"number x i = result\", where result is the product of `number` and `i`.\n\nFor example, if the user enters the number 5, the output will be:\n```\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```",
