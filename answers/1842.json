  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers and two indices as input, and returns a new list containing the elements between the two indices.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef get_list_between_indices(lst, start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the elements between the start and end indices.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list of integers.\n        start (int): The starting index (inclusive).\n        end (int): The ending index (inclusive).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the elements between the start and end indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    return lst[start:end+1]\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nstart = 2\nend = 5\nresult = get_list_between_indices(lst, start, end)\nprint(result)  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\nThis code defines a function `get_list_between_indices` that takes a list `lst`, a starting index `start`, and an ending index `end` as input. It returns a new list containing the elements between the `start` and `end` indices, inclusive. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a list of integers and print the resulting list.",
