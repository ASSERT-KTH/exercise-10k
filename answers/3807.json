  "answer": "**Triangle Numbers Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nA triangle number or triangular number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The nth triangle number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, and it is represented by the formula:\n\nTn = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the first n triangle numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the first n triangle numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of triangle numbers to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n triangle numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    triangle_numbers = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the ith triangle number using the formula\n        triangle_number = i * (i + 1) // 2\n        triangle_numbers.append(triangle_number)\n    return triangle_numbers\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of triangle numbers to calculate: \"))\n    triangle_numbers = calculate_triangle_numbers(n)\n    print(\"The first {} triangle numbers are:\".format(n))\n    for i, num in enumerate(triangle_numbers, start=1):\n        print(\"T{} = {}\".format(i, num))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_triangle_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes an empty list `triangle_numbers` to store the results.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, the `i`th triangle number is calculated using the formula `i * (i + 1) / 2` and appended to the `triangle_numbers` list.\n4. The `main` function asks the user to input the number of triangle numbers to calculate, calls the `calculate_triangle_numbers` function, and prints the results.\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nEnter the number of triangle numbers to calculate: 5\nThe first 5 triangle numbers are:\nT1 = 1\nT2 = 3\nT3 = 6\nT4 = 10\nT5 = 15\n```",
