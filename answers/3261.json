  "answer": "**Number Printer Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple program that uses a `for` loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\n# Define the range of numbers to print\nstart = 1\nend = 10\n\n# Use a for loop to print the numbers\nfor i in range(start, end + 1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* We define the start and end of the range as variables `start` and `end`.\n* We use the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from `start` to `end` (inclusive).\n* We use a `for` loop to iterate over this sequence and print each number.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\n**Note:** The `end + 1` in the `range` function is used because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value. By adding 1, we ensure that the end value is included in the sequence.",
