  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. The program should have two functions: one to calculate the grade and another to display the result. The grade calculation is as follows: scores 90 and above are Grade A, scores between 80 and 89 are Grade B, scores between 70 and 79 are Grade C, scores between 60 and 69 are Grade D, and scores below 60 are Grade F.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n    \n    Args:\n    score (float): The score of the student.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Define a function to display the result\ndef display_result(name, score, grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Display the result of the student.\n    \n    Args:\n    name (str): The name of the student.\n    score (float): The score of the student.\n    grade (str): The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Student Name: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n\n    # Display the result\n    display_result(name, score, grade)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define two functions: `calculate_grade` and `display_result`. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given conditions. The `display_result` function takes the name, score, and grade of the student and prints them.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter the student's name and score. We then calculate the grade using the `calculate_grade` function and display the result using the `display_result` function.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter the student's name and score. After entering the details, it will display the student's name, score, and grade.\n\n```\nEnter the student's name: John Doe\nEnter the student's score: 85\nStudent Name: John Doe\nScore: 85.0\nGrade: B\n```",
