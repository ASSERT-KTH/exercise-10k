  "answer": "**Character Count Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a character as input and returns the count of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_char(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the count of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The count of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    count = count_char(string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' appears {count} times in the string '{string}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `count_char` function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified character.\n*   The function takes two arguments: `string` and `char`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `count_char` with an example string and character.\n*   The result is printed to the console, showing the count of the specified character in the string.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This function is case-sensitive and considers 'a' and 'A' as different characters.\n*   It counts each occurrence of the character in the string, including consecutive occurrences.",
