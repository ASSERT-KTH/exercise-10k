  "answer": "**Bank Account Simulator**\n================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function simulates a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The function uses a class to encapsulate the account's data and methods.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the bank account with an initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Displays the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter an amount to deposit into the account.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter an amount to withdraw from the account.\n\t* Check Balance: Display the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Quit the program.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to exit.\n\nNote: This implementation provides basic functionality and does not include error handling for non-numeric input or other edge cases. You may want to add additional checks and balances depending on your specific requirements.",
