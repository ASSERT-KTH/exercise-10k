  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the tax on a given income based on a simple tax bracket system.\n\n### Tax Bracket System\n\nThe tax bracket system used in this program is as follows:\n\n* 0 - 10,000: 0% tax\n* 10,001 - 20,000: 10% tax on amount above 10,000\n* 20,001 - 50,000: 15% tax on amount above 20,000\n* 50,001 and above: 20% tax on amount above 50,000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax on a given income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income to calculate tax on.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tax.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income <= 10000:\n        return 0\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        return (income - 10000) * 0.10\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + ((income - 20000) * 0.15)\n    else:\n        return (10000 * 0.10) + (30000 * 0.15) + ((income - 50000) * 0.20)\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: \"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your net income is: ${income - tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the income is 15,000, the tax will be 500 (10% of 5,000) and the net income will be 14,500.\n* If the income is 30,000, the tax will be 2,500 (10% of 10,000 + 15% of 10,000) and the net income will be 27,500.\n* If the income is 60,000, the tax will be 8,500 (10% of 10,000 + 15% of 30,000 + 20% of 10,000) and the net income will be 51,500.\n\n### Notes\n\nThis program uses a simple tax bracket system and does not take into account other factors that may affect tax calculations, such as deductions and exemptions. In a real-world application, you would need to consider these factors and use a more complex tax calculation formula.",
