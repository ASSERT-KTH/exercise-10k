  "prompt": "Create a function that takes in a dictionary and returns True if the dictionary contains all required keys, and False otherwise",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to verify if a dictionary contains all the necessary keys. This approach will involve creating a function that checks for the presence of required keys in a given dictionary. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef check_required_keys(dictionary, required_keys):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a dictionary contains all required keys.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be checked.\n        required_keys (list): A list of required keys.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the dictionary contains all required keys, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input dictionary is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input dictionary must be a dict.\")\n\n    # Then, we need to check if the required keys are a list\n    if not isinstance(required_keys, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"The required keys must be a list.\")\n\n    # Now, we can iterate over each required key\n    for key in required_keys:\n        # For each required key, we check if it exists in the dictionary\n        # If it doesn't exist, we immediately return False\n        if key not in dictionary:\n            return False\n\n    # If we've checked all required keys and haven't returned False, then the dictionary contains all required keys\n    # So, we return True\n    return True\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndictionary = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nrequired_keys = [\"name\", \"age\", \"city\"]\nprint(check_required_keys(dictionary, required_keys))  # Output: True\n\ndictionary = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nrequired_keys = [\"name\", \"age\", \"city\"]\nprint(check_required_keys(dictionary, required_keys))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_required_keys` takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `required_keys`. It first checks if the input `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary and if `required_keys` is a list, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* It then iterates over each key in `required_keys`, checking if the key exists in the `dictionary`. If any key is not found, the function immediately returns `False`.\n* If the function completes the iteration over all required keys without returning `False`, it means all required keys are present in the dictionary, so it returns `True`.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the `check_required_keys` function with a sample dictionary and required keys, showcasing both a successful and unsuccessful scenario.",
