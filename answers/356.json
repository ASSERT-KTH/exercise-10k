  "answer": "### List Intersection Function\n#### Overview\n\nThis function will find the intersection of two lists, returning a new list containing elements that are common to both input lists.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing elements that are common to both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n    print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", list_intersection(list1, list2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `list1`. If an element is also found in `list2`, it is included in the resulting list. The function then returns this resulting list.\n\nNote: This function has a time complexity of O(n*m) due to the `in` operator's linear search in the list. For larger lists, using sets can provide a more efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n + m).\n\n#### Alternative Solution Using Sets\n\nIf the order of elements does not matter and you do not need to preserve duplicates, you can use sets for a more efficient solution:\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection_set(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two lists using sets.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing elements that are common to both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n    print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n    print(\"Intersection (set):\", list_intersection_set(list1, list2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
