  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides a hint if the guess is too high or too low.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the input is a valid integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. It then enters a while loop, where it asks the user for their guess and checks if the input is a valid integer.\n3. If the input is valid, it increments the number of attempts and checks if the guess is correct.\n4. If the guess is correct, it congratulates the user and ends the game. If not, it provides a hint if the guess is too high or too low.\n5. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nToo low! Try a higher number.\nTake a guess: 75\nToo high! Try a lower number.\nTake a guess: 67\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
