  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nresult = sum_even_numbers(n)\nprint(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n*   The function `sum_even_numbers(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `total` to 0.\n*   It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.\n*   Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.\n*   If `i` is even, it adds `i` to the `total`.\n*   After the loop finishes, the function returns the `total`, which is the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10: `sum_even_numbers(10)`\n*   Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20: `sum_even_numbers(20)`\n*   Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 50: `sum_even_numbers(50)`",
