  "answer": "Reversing a Singly Linked List\n==========================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a singly linked list, reverse the order of its nodes.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### Approach\n\nTo reverse a singly linked list, we can use a three-pointer approach: `prev`, `current`, and `next`. We initialize `prev` to `None` and `current` to the head of the list. Then, we traverse the list, updating the `next` pointer of each node to point to the previous node.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in the linked list.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    \"\"\"Represents a singly linked list.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n\n    def append(self, data):\n        \"\"\"Appends a new node to the end of the list.\"\"\"\n        new_node = Node(data)\n        if not self.head:\n            self.head = new_node\n            return\n        current = self.head\n        while current.next:\n            current = current.next\n        current.next = new_node\n\n    def reverse(self):\n        \"\"\"Reverses the linked list.\"\"\"\n        prev = None\n        current = self.head\n        while current:\n            next_node = current.next\n            current.next = prev\n            prev = current\n            current = next_node\n        self.head = prev\n\n    def print_list(self):\n        \"\"\"Prints the linked list.\"\"\"\n        current = self.head\n        while current:\n            print(current.data, end=\" \")\n            current = current.next\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nlinked_list = LinkedList()\nlinked_list.append(1)\nlinked_list.append(2)\nlinked_list.append(3)\nlinked_list.append(4)\nlinked_list.append(5)\n\nprint(\"Original list:\")\nlinked_list.print_list()\n\nlinked_list.reverse()\n\nprint(\"Reversed list:\")\nlinked_list.print_list()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a `Node` class to represent each node in the linked list, containing `data` and a `next` pointer.\n2. We define a `LinkedList` class to represent the entire list, containing a `head` node and methods to append new nodes, reverse the list, and print the list.\n3. In the `reverse` method, we initialize `prev` to `None` and `current` to the head of the list.\n4. We traverse the list, updating the `next` pointer of each node to point to the previous node.\n5. Finally, we update the `head` of the list to point to the new first node, which is the last node in the original list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we only traverse the list once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers.",
