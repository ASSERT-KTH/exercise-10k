  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user, checks if it can be converted to a floating-point number, and prints a success message if valid.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef main():\n    input_str = input()\n    try:\n        float(input_str)\n        print(\"Success\")\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n\nmain()\n```\nI've written the code exactly as specified, with the `main` function, the input string, the try-except block, and the `main` function call at the end. Let me know if this meets your requirements!",
