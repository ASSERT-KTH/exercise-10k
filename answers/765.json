  "answer": "### Declaring and Printing a List of Student Names\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that declares a list of variables to store a collection of student names and then prints out the list.\n\n```python\n# Declare a list of student names\nstudent_names = [\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"Alice Johnson\",\n    \"Bob Brown\",\n    \"Charlie Davis\"\n]\n\n# Print out the list of student names\nprint(\"List of Student Names:\")\nprint(student_names)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\nList of Student Names:\n['John Doe', 'Jane Smith', 'Alice Johnson', 'Bob Brown', 'Charlie Davis']\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a `for` loop to print out each student name on a new line:\n\n```python\n# Declare a list of student names\nstudent_names = [\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"Alice Johnson\",\n    \"Bob Brown\",\n    \"Charlie Davis\"\n]\n\n# Print out the list of student names\nprint(\"List of Student Names:\")\nfor name in student_names:\n    print(name)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nList of Student Names:\nJohn Doe\nJane Smith\nAlice Johnson\nBob Brown\nCharlie Davis\n```",
