  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess a random number between 1 and 100 until they guess correctly.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made\n    tries = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Continue to ask the user for input until they guess the number\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of tries the player has made\n        tries += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            # If the user guessed the number, print a success message and exit the loop\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1.  We first generate a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2.  We then enter a while loop that continues until the user guesses the number.\n3.  Inside the loop, we ask the user for their guess using `input(\"Take a guess: \")`.\n4.  We attempt to convert the user's guess to an integer using `int(user_guess)`. If this fails (for example, if the user enters a string), we print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n5.  We increment the number of tries the player has made.\n6.  We check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess, and print a hint message accordingly.\n7.  If the user guesses the number, we print a success message and exit the loop.\n\n### Example usage\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file called `guess_the_number.py` and run it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython guess_the_number.py\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, you will be given a hint (e.g., \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\"). Keep guessing until you find the correct number.",
