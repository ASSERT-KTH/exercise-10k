  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps. This function will take two parameters: the array and the number of steps, and return the rotated array. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_array(array, steps):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array (list): The input array.\n    steps (int): The number of steps to rotate the array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The rotated array.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the array is empty\n    if len(array) == 0:\n        return array\n\n    # We first need to handle the case where the number of steps is greater than the length of the array.\n    # We can do this by taking the modulus of the number of steps with the length of the array.\n    # This is because after len(array) steps, the array will be the same as the original array.\n    steps = steps % len(array)\n    \n    # Now, we can use Python's list slicing feature to rotate the array.\n    # We split the array into two parts: the last 'steps' elements and the rest of the array.\n    # We then concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated array.\n    # The '-steps:' slice means \"get all elements from the end of the array back to 'steps' elements from the end\".\n    # The ':steps' slice means \"get all elements from the start of the array up to but not including the 'steps'th element\".\n    rotated_array = array[-steps:] + array[:len(array)-steps]\n    \n    # Finally, we return the rotated array.\n    return rotated_array\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsteps = 2\nprint(rotate_array(array, steps))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `rotate_array` first checks if the input `array` is empty. If it is, the function returns the original `array` as there's nothing to rotate.\n* To handle cases where the number of `steps` is greater than the length of the `array`, the function calculates the effective number of `steps` by taking the modulus of `steps` with the length of the `array`. This is done using the line `steps = steps % len(array)`.\n* The function then uses Python's list slicing feature to rotate the `array`. It splits the `array` into two parts: the last `steps` elements and the rest of the `array`, and concatenates these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated `array`.\n* Finally, the function returns the rotated `array`.",
