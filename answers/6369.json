  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a reduction function as input and returns the result of applying the reduction to all elements in the array",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef apply_reduction(array, reduction_function):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a reduction function to all elements in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        reduction_function (function): A function that takes two arguments and returns one value.\n\n    Returns:\n        The result of applying the reduction function to all elements in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not array:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array cannot be empty\")\n\n    return reduce(reduction_function, array)\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nreduction_function = lambda x, y: x + y\n\nresult = apply_reduction(array, reduction_function)\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\nThis program uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module, which applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. The `apply_reduction` function takes an array and a reduction function as input, checks if the array is not empty, and then applies the reduction function to all elements in the array using `reduce`.\n\nIn the example usage, we define an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and a reduction function `lambda x, y: x + y`, which adds two numbers. The `apply_reduction` function is then called with the array and the reduction function, and the result is printed. The output is `15`, which is the sum of all elements in the array.\n\nYou can replace the `reduction_function` with any other function that takes two arguments and returns one value, such as `lambda x, y: x * y` for multiplication or `lambda x, y: x - y` for subtraction.",
