  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and a key function as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct values returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements that correspond to each key.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that groups a list of elements based on a given key function, returning a dictionary with distinct key values and corresponding element lists. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef group_by_key(lst, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and a key function as input, \n    and returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct values \n    returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements \n    that correspond to each key.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        key (function): The key function.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the distinct values \n        returned by the key function and the values are lists of elements \n        that correspond to each key.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grouped elements\n    grouped_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Calculate the key for the current element using the key function\n        k = key(element)\n        \n        # If the calculated key is not already in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value\n        if k not in grouped_dict:\n            # This is done to avoid a KeyError when trying to append to a non-existent key\n            grouped_dict[k] = []\n        \n        # Append the current element to the list of elements corresponding to its key\n        grouped_dict[k].append(element)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with the grouped elements\n    return grouped_dict\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\nprint(group_by_key(numbers, is_even))  # Output: {False: [1, 3, 5], True: [2, 4, 6]}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `group_by_key` initializes an empty dictionary `grouped_dict` to store the grouped elements from the input list `lst`.\n*   It iterates over each element in `lst`, calculates the key using the provided `key` function, and checks if this key already exists in `grouped_dict`. If not, it adds the key with an empty list as its value.\n*   The function then appends the current element to the list of elements corresponding to its calculated key in `grouped_dict`.\n*   Finally, it returns `grouped_dict`, which contains the grouped elements based on the keys generated by the `key` function.",
