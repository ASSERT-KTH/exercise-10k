  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the discount on a product based on its price. If the price is above 100, the discount is 10%. If the price is between 50 and 100, the discount is 5%. If the price is below 50, the discount is 0%.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int price;\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter the price: \";\n    std::cin >> price;\n\n    double discount = 0;\n    double discountPrice = 0;\n    double savedAmount = 0;\n\n    if (price > 100) {\n        discount = (price * 10) / 100.0;\n    } else if (price > 50) {\n        discount = (price * 5) / 100.0;\n    }\n\n    discountPrice = price - discount;\n    savedAmount = discount;\n\n    std::cout << \"Original price: \" << price << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Discount: \" << discount << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Discount price: \" << discountPrice << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Amount saved: \" << savedAmount << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code matches the specification provided, including the inclusion of the `iostream` header, the `main` function, the declaration of variables, the input of the price, the calculation of the discount, the calculation of the discount price and saved amount, and the output of the original price, discount, discount price, and saved amount.",
