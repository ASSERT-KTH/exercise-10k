Run the program.\n2.  Choose an option from the menu:\n    *   Add Student: Enter a student's name and grade to add them to the dictionary.\n    *   Remove Student: Enter a student's name to remove them from the dictionary.\n    *   Update Grade: Enter a student's name and new grade to update their grade.\n    *   Calculate Average: Calculate the average grade of all students.\n    *   Display Grades: Display all students and their grades.\n    *   Exit: Exit the program.",
