  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a dictionary as input where the keys are student names and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and then find the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, the program should return all of them.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef find_highest_average_grade(students):\n    highest_average_grade = 0\n    highest_average_grade_students = []\n\n    for student, grades in students.items():\n        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n        if average_grade > highest_average_grade:\n            highest_average_grade = average_grade\n            highest_average_grade_students = [student]\n        elif average_grade == highest_average_grade:\n            highest_average_grade_students.append(student)\n\n    return highest_average_grade_students\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    'Alice': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 80},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 95},\n    'Charlie': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 90}\n}\n\nresult = find_highest_average_grade(students)\nprint(result)\n```\nNote that I've used a simple `sum` and `len` to calculate the average grade, which is sufficient for this problem. Also, I've used a list to store the students with the highest average grade, as there can be multiple students with the same highest average grade.",
