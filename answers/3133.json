  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple quiz program written in Python. This program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Paris\",\n        \"B\": \"London\",\n        \"C\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each question\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n\n        # Ask the user for their answer\n        user_answer = input(\"Choose your answer (A, B, C, D): \").upper()\n\n        # Check if the user's answer is correct\n        if user_answer == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer is {options['answer']}: {options[options['answer']]}\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz finished! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    quiz()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by typing the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n4. After answering all questions, the program will display your final score.\n\n**Adding More Questions:**\n\nTo add more questions to the quiz, simply add more entries to the `questions` dictionary. Each entry should have a question as the key and a dictionary with options and an answer as the value. For example:\n\n```python\nquestions[\"What is the smallest country in the world?\"] = {\n    \"A\": \"Vatican City\",\n    \"B\": \"Monaco\",\n    \"C\": \"Nauru\",\n    \"D\": \"Tuvalu\",\n    \"answer\": \"A\"\n}\n```",
