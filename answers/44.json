  "answer": "**Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm Implementation**\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given number, known as the limit. Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm:\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all prime numbers up to the given limit.\n\n    :param limit: The upper limit for finding prime numbers.\n    :return: A list of prime numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a boolean array, prime, of size limit+1\n    prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = False\n\n    # Iterate from 2 to sqrt(limit)\n    for p in range(2, int(limit ** 0.5) + 1):\n        # If p is a prime, mark as composite all the multiples of p\n        if prime[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                prime[i] = False\n\n    # Return a list of all prime numbers in the range\n    return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if prime[p]]\n\n\ndef main():\n    limit = 50  # Example limit\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)\n    print(f\"Prime numbers up to {limit}: {primes}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Create a boolean array, `prime`, of size `limit+1`, where `prime[i]` represents whether `i` is a prime number or not.\n    *   Initialize all values as `True`, assuming all numbers are prime initially.\n    *   Set `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to `False`, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.\n2.  **Iteration**:\n    *   Iterate from 2 to `sqrt(limit)`, as any factors of a number must be less than or equal to its square root.\n    *   For each prime `p` in this range, mark as composite (`False`) all the multiples of `p` by setting `prime[i]` to `False` for `i` ranging from `p*p` to `limit+1` in increments of `p`.\n3.  **Result**:\n    *   Return a list of all prime numbers in the range by iterating over the `prime` array and including the indices of the `True` values.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is O(n log log n), where n is the limit. This makes it an efficient method for finding prime numbers up to a given number.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIn the provided code, the `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to find all prime numbers up to a given limit (in this case, 50). The output will be a list of prime numbers up to the specified limit.",
