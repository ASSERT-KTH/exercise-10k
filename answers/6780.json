  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of these operations.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Basic Arithmetic Operations\n\n## Description\nThis program performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers and prints the results.\n\n## Requirements\nThe program requires two numbers as input.\n\n## Code\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nsum = num1 + num2\nsub = num1 - num2\nmul = num1 * num2\ndiv = num1 / num2\n\nprint(\"Addition: \", sum)\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", sub)\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", mul)\nprint(\"Division: \", div)\n```\n## Explanation\n1. The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers using the `input` function.\n2. The input values are converted to floating-point numbers using the `float` function.\n3. The program then performs the arithmetic operations using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators.\n4. The results of each operation are stored in separate variables (`sum`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div`).\n5. Finally, the program prints the results of each operation using the `print` function.\n\n### Note\nThis program does not handle the case where the second number is zero, which would result in a division-by-zero error. To handle this case, you could add a conditional statement to check if the second number is zero before performing the division operation.\n```",
