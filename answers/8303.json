  "prompt": "Create a program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The pattern should be a square of asterisks with the size specified by the user. Use loops to achieve this.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_square(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a square pattern of asterisks with the specified size.\n\n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the square.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the size of the square from the user\n    size = int(input(\"Enter the size of the square: \"))\n\n    # Print the square pattern\n    print_square(size)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `print_square` function takes an integer `size` as input, representing the size of the square.\n2. The outer loop (`for i in range(size)`) iterates over each row of the square.\n3. The inner loop (`for j in range(size)`) iterates over each column of the square and prints an asterisk (*) followed by a space.\n4. After each row is printed, `print()` is called without any arguments to move to the next line.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the size of the square.\n6. The `print_square` function is then called with the user-specified size to print the square pattern.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run this program, you will be prompted to enter the size of the square. If you enter `5`, the program will print a 5x5 square of asterisks:\n\n```\nEnter the size of the square: 5\n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n```",
