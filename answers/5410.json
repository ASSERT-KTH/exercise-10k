  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that checks if a given number falls within a specified range, providing a clear and step-by-step solution to your problem. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_within_range(num, lower, upper):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is within a specified range (inclusive).\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to check.\n        lower (int): The lower bound of the range (inclusive).\n        upper (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input number is an integer\n    # This is because the problem statement doesn't specify what to do with floats\n    # We'll assume that the input number should be an integer\n    if not isinstance(num, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"The input number must be an integer.\")\n\n    # Next, we need to check if the lower and upper bounds are integers\n    # This is because the problem statement doesn't specify what to do with floats\n    # We'll assume that the lower and upper bounds should be integers\n    if not isinstance(lower, int) or not isinstance(upper, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"The lower and upper bounds must be integers.\")\n\n    # Now, we need to check if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound\n    # This is because the range is inclusive, so the lower bound should be less than or equal to the upper bound\n    if lower > upper:\n        raise ValueError(\"The lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.\")\n\n    # Finally, we can check if the number is within the range\n    # We'll use the built-in comparison operators to check if the number is greater than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound\n    return lower <= num <= upper\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_within_range` first checks if the input `num` and the bounds `lower` and `upper` are integers, raising a `TypeError` if any of them are not. This ensures the function works with the correct data types.\n* It then checks if the `lower` bound is less than or equal to the `upper` bound, raising a `ValueError` if this condition is not met, to guarantee a valid range.\n* The function uses the built-in comparison operators to check if `num` is within the range defined by `lower` and `upper`, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.\n* The use of `lower <= num <= upper` allows for an inclusive range check, meaning the function returns `True` if `num` equals either the `lower` or `upper` bound.",
