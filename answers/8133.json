  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks the strength of a password based on the following criteria:\n\n* Length: The password should be at least 8 characters long.\n* Uppercase letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* Lowercase letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.\n* Special characters: The password should contain at least one special character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating the strength of the password.\n    \"\"\"\n    errors = []\n\n    # Check length\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        errors.append(\"Password should be at least 8 characters long.\")\n\n    # Check for uppercase letters\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\n        errors.append(\"Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check for lowercase letters\n    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):\n        errors.append(\"Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n\n    # Check for numbers\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n        errors.append(\"Password should contain at least one number.\")\n\n    # Check for special characters\n    if not any(not char.isalnum() for char in password):\n        errors.append(\"Password should contain at least one special character.\")\n\n    # Return the result\n    if len(errors) == 0:\n        return \"Password is strong.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Password is weak. The following errors were found:\\n\" + \"\\n\".join(errors)\n\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    print(check_password_strength(password))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a strong password: `P@ssw0rd123`\n* Enter a weak password: `password`\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `any` function to check if any character in the password meets a certain condition.\n* The program returns a message indicating the strength of the password, along with any errors that were found.\n* You can modify the program to check for additional criteria, such as password similarity to common words or phrases.",
