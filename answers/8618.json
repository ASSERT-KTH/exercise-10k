  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest common prefix of a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strings (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strings:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strings, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for string in strings:\n            if string[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"hello world\", \"hello python\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hello\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. Iterate over each character in the shortest string.\n4. For each character, check if it is the same in all strings at the same position. If it is not, return the prefix up to the current position.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return the entire shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n*m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings. This is because we iterate over each character in the shortest string and then check each string at that position.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(1), excluding the input list, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the shortest string and the current character.",
