  "prompt": "Create a program that determines the grade of an ebook seller based on the number of ebooks sold. The grade is determined by the following conditions: if the seller sold less than 50 ebooks, they get an F grade; if they sold between 50 and 100 ebooks, they get a D grade; if they sold between 101 and 200 ebooks, they get a C grade; if they sold between 201 and 400 ebooks, they get a B grade; and if they sold more than 400 ebooks, they get an A grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef determine_grade(sales):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the grade of an ebook seller based on the number of ebooks sold.\n\n    Args:\n        sales (int): The number of ebooks sold.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the ebook seller.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if sales < 50:\n        return \"F\"\n    elif 50 <= sales <= 100:\n        return \"D\"\n    elif 101 <= sales <= 200:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif 201 <= sales <= 400:\n        return \"B\"\n    else:\n        return \"A\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    sales = int(input(\"Enter the number of ebooks sold: \"))\n    grade = determine_grade(sales)\n    print(f\"The grade of the ebook seller is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The `determine_grade` function takes an integer `sales` as an argument, which represents the number of ebooks sold.\n2. The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the number of ebooks sold.\n3. The `main` function asks the user to input the number of ebooks sold, calls the `determine_grade` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example use cases:\n\n* If the user inputs `20`, the output will be `The grade of the ebook seller is: F`.\n* If the user inputs `75`, the output will be `The grade of the ebook seller is: D`.\n* If the user inputs `150`, the output will be `The grade of the ebook seller is: C`.\n* If the user inputs `300`, the output will be `The grade of the ebook seller is: B`.\n* If the user inputs `500`, the output will be `The grade of the ebook seller is: A`.",
