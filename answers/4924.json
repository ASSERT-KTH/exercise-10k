The program defines a function `calculate_gpa` that takes a list of grades and credits as input and returns the calculated GPA.\n2. The function uses a dictionary `grade_map` to map grades to their corresponding GPA values.\n3. The function initializes variables `total_credits` and `total_gpa` to calculate the GPA.\n4. The function iterates over the grades and credits, calculates the GPA for each course, and adds it to the total GPA.\n5. The function checks if the grade is valid and skips it if it's not.\n6. The function calculates the overall GPA by dividing the total GPA by the total credits.\n7. The `main` function asks the user for the number of courses, grades, and credits for each course, and then calls the `calculate_gpa` function to calculate the GPA.\n8. The `main` function prints the calculated GPA.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nEnter the number of courses: 3\nEnter the grade for course 1 (e.g., A, B, C, etc.): A\nEnter the credits for course 1: 3\nEnter the grade for course 2 (e.g., A, B, C, etc.): B\nEnter the credits for course 2: 4\nEnter the grade for course 3 (e.g., A, B, C, etc.): C\nEnter the credits for course 3: 3\nYour GPA is: 2.93\n```",
