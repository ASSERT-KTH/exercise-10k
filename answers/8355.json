  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints out all the numbers from 1 to the input number. Use a for loop or a while loop to achieve this. If the input number is less than 1, print an error message.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code that matches the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\n# Author: Your Name\n# Date: Today's Date\n\n# Get user input\nnumero = int(input(\"Ingrese el n\u00famero: \"))\n\n# Check if input is valid\nif numero < 1:\n    print(\"Error: El n\u00famero debe ser mayor que 0\")\nelse:\n    # Print numbers from 1 to input number\n    for i in range(1, numero + 1):\n        print(i)\n```\n\nNote: I've used English for the comment at the top of the code, but you can change it to Spanish if you prefer. Also, I've used \"Your Name\" and \"Today's Date\" as placeholders for the author and date, respectively. You should replace these with your actual name and the current date.",
