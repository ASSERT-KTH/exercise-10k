  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using functions. The program should ask for the length and width of the rectangle, then use two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. Finally, it should print out the results.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n    length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n    width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n\ndef calculate_perimeter(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n    length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n    width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (length + width)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask for the length and width of the rectangle\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area and perimeter\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)\n\n    # Print out the results\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area}\")\n    print(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The program defines two functions: `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`. \n   - `calculate_area` takes in the length and width of a rectangle and returns the area by multiplying the length and width.\n   - `calculate_perimeter` takes in the length and width of a rectangle and returns the perimeter by using the formula `2 * (length + width)`.\n\n2. The `main` function asks the user for the length and width of the rectangle using the `input` function.\n\n3. It then calls the `calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter` functions with the provided length and width to get the area and perimeter.\n\n4. Finally, it prints out the calculated area and perimeter.\n\n### Example usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter the length and width of the rectangle. For example, if you enter `5` as the length and `3` as the width, it will output:\n```\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\nThe area of the rectangle is: 15.0\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is: 16.0\n```",
