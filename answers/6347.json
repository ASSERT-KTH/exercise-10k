  "answer": "**Modulus Operation**\n=====================\n\nThe modulus operation, denoted by the `%` symbol, finds the remainder of a division operation between two numbers. It is a fundamental operation in mathematics and programming.\n\n**Syntax**\n----------\n\nThe syntax for the modulus operation is as follows:\n```python\nremainder = dividend % divisor\n```\nWhere:\n\n* `dividend` is the number being divided\n* `divisor` is the number by which we are dividing\n* `remainder` is the result of the modulus operation\n\n**Examples**\n------------\n\nHere are some examples of the modulus operation:\n\n* `17 % 5 = 2` (17 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2)\n* `24 % 3 = 0` (24 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 0)\n* `7 % 2 = 1` (7 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1)\n\n**Use Cases**\n-------------\n\nThe modulus operation has several use cases:\n\n1. **Checking for even or odd numbers**: The modulus operation can be used to check if a number is even or odd. If a number `n` is even, then `n % 2 = 0`. If a number `n` is odd, then `n % 2 = 1`.\n2. **Wrapping around a range**: The modulus operation can be used to wrap around a range of values. For example, if we have a clock with 12 hours, we can use the modulus operation to convert a 24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock: `hour % 12`.\n3. **Checking for divisibility**: The modulus operation can be used to check if a number is divisible by another number. If `a % b = 0`, then `a` is divisible by `b`.\n4. **Generating random numbers**: The modulus operation can be used to generate random numbers within a certain range. For example, `rand() % 10` can generate a random number between 0 and 9.\n5. **Cryptography**: The modulus operation is used in cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, to ensure secure data transmission.\n\n**Code Examples**\n----------------\n\nHere are some code examples in Python:\n```python\n# Example 1: Checking for even or odd numbers\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\nprint(is_even(10))  # True\nprint(is_even(11))  # False\n\n# Example 2: Wrapping around a range\ndef convert_to_12_hour_clock(hour):\n    return hour % 12\n\nprint(convert_to_12_hour_clock(14))  # 2\nprint(convert_to_12_hour_clock(25))  # 1\n\n# Example 3: Checking for divisibility\ndef is_divisible(a, b):\n    return a % b == 0\n\nprint(is_divisible(12, 3))  # True\nprint(is_divisible(12, 5))  # False\n```\nIn conclusion, the modulus operation is a fundamental operation that has numerous use cases in mathematics, programming, and cryptography. Its ability to find the remainder of a division operation makes it a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems.",
