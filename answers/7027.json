  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades. The function should return a new dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their average grades. Round the average grades to two decimal places.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grades of students from a given dictionary. This function will return a new dictionary with student names as keys and their average grades as values. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grades of students from a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary where keys are student names and values are their average grades.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student\n        total_grades = sum(grades)\n        \n        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades\n        average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)\n        \n        # Round the average grade to two decimal places\n        average_grade = round(average_grade, 2)\n        \n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the average grades\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades_dict = {\n    'John': [90, 85, 95],\n    'Alice': [88, 92, 89],\n    'Bob': [76, 81, 85]\n}\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades_dict)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average_grades` function initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades of students.\n*   It iterates over each student in the `grades_dict` using a for loop, calculates the sum of all grades using the `sum` function, and then calculates the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of grades.\n*   The average grade is rounded to two decimal places using the `round` function and stored in the `average_grades` dictionary.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary containing the average grades of all students.",
