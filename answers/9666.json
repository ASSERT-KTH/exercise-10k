Run the program.\n2. Enter a sentence when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is a test\").\n3. The program will print out the number of words in the sentence (e.g., \"The sentence contains 6 words.\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `split()` method is used to split the sentence into a list of words, using whitespace as the delimiter.\n* The `len()` function is used to count the number of words in the list.\n* The program uses a simple `main()` function to handle user input and output.",
