  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the bases and height of a trapezoid as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a trapezoid given the lengths of its two bases and its height.\n\n    Args:\n        base1 (float): The length of the first base.\n        base2 (float): The length of the second base.\n        height (float): The height of the trapezoid.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the trapezoid.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base1 <= 0 or base2 <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"All input values must be positive numbers.\")\n\n    # The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n    area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the bases and height from the user\n    base1 = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first base: \"))\n    base2 = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second base: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the trapezoid: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the area\n        area = trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the trapezoid is: {area}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `trapezoid_area` function takes in the lengths of the two bases (`base1` and `base2`) and the height of the trapezoid as input.\n* It first checks if all input values are positive numbers, raising a `ValueError` if any of them are not.\n* The function then calculates the area using the formula `area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2`.\n* The `main` function gets the bases and height from the user, calls `trapezoid_area` to calculate the area, and prints the result. If any of the input values are invalid, it catches the `ValueError` and prints an error message.",
