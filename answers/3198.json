  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and uses if/else statements to determine the maximum number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses if/else statements to determine the maximum of three numbers:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(a, b, c):\n    if a >= b and a >= c:\n        return a\n    elif b >= a and b >= c:\n        return b\n    else:\n        return c\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nnum3 = float(input(\"Enter third number: \"))\n\nmax_num = find_max(num1, num2, num3)\n\nprint(\"The maximum number is: \", max_num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `find_max` function takes three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.\n* It uses if/else statements to compare these numbers and determine which one is the maximum.\n* If `a` is greater than or equal to both `b` and `c`, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it checks if `b` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `c`, and returns `b` if true. If neither condition is met, it returns `c` as the maximum number.\n* The program then takes three numbers as input from the user and calls the `find_max` function to determine the maximum number.\n* Finally, it prints out the maximum number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `10`, `20`, and `30`, the program will output `The maximum number is: 30.0`.\n* If the user enters `5`, `5`, and `10`, the program will output `The maximum number is: 10.0`.\n* If the user enters `20`, `10`, and `5`, the program will output `The maximum number is: 20.0`.",
