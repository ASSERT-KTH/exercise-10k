  "answer": "**Complex Number Arithmetic Operations Program**\n\nBelow is an example program in Python that performs arithmetic operations with complex numbers.\n\n```python\nclass ComplexNumber:\n    \"\"\"Class representing a complex number.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, real=0, imaginary=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a complex number.\n\n        Args:\n            real (float, optional): Real part of the complex number. Defaults to 0.\n            imaginary (float, optional): Imaginary part of the complex number. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.real = real\n        self.imaginary = imaginary\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        \"\"\"Return a string representation of the complex number.\"\"\"\n        return f\"{self.real} + {self.imaginary}i\"\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add two complex numbers.\n\n        Args:\n            other (ComplexNumber): Complex number to add.\n\n        Returns:\n            ComplexNumber: Sum of the two complex numbers.\n        \"\"\"\n        real_part = self.real + other.real\n        imaginary_part = self.imaginary + other.imaginary\n        return ComplexNumber(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Subtract one complex number from another.\n\n        Args:\n            other (ComplexNumber): Complex number to subtract.\n\n        Returns:\n            ComplexNumber: Difference of the two complex numbers.\n        \"\"\"\n        real_part = self.real - other.real\n        imaginary_part = self.imaginary - other.imaginary\n        return ComplexNumber(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Multiply two complex numbers.\n\n        Args:\n            other (ComplexNumber): Complex number to multiply.\n\n        Returns:\n            ComplexNumber: Product of the two complex numbers.\n        \"\"\"\n        real_part = self.real * other.real - self.imaginary * other.imaginary\n        imaginary_part = self.real * other.imaginary + self.imaginary * other.real\n        return ComplexNumber(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n    def __truediv__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Divide one complex number by another.\n\n        Args:\n            other (ComplexNumber): Complex number to divide by.\n\n        Returns:\n            ComplexNumber: Quotient of the two complex numbers.\n        \"\"\"\n        denominator = other.real ** 2 + other.imaginary ** 2\n        real_part = (self.real * other.real + self.imaginary * other.imaginary) / denominator\n        imaginary_part = (self.imaginary * other.real - self.real * other.imaginary) / denominator\n        return ComplexNumber(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = ComplexNumber(3, 4)\n    num2 = ComplexNumber(1, 2)\n\n    print(f\"Number 1: {num1}\")\n    print(f\"Number 2: {num2}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nArithmetic Operations:\")\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1 + num2}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1 - num2}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1 * num2}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1 / num2}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n*   We define a `ComplexNumber` class to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.\n*   The class includes methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing complex numbers using the standard formulas for these operations.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `ComplexNumber` class by performing arithmetic operations on two example complex numbers.\n*   The program prints the results of each operation to the console.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\nNumber 1: 3 + 4i\nNumber 2: 1 + 2i\n\nArithmetic Operations:\nAddition: 4.0 + 6.0i\nSubtraction: 2.0 + 2.0i\nMultiplication: -5.0 + 10.0i\nDivision: 1.4 + 0.2i\n```",
