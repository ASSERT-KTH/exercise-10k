  "answer": "Here's a Python program that takes user input for two numbers and an operation, validates the input, performs the operation, and includes error handling:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user input for two numbers and an operation.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n            return num1, num2, operation\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input.

It uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until valid numbers are entered.\n2. `validate_operation()`: This function validates the operation to ensure it's one of the four basic arithmetic operations. It uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until a valid operation is entered.\n3. `perform_operation()`: This function performs the specified operation on the two numbers. It includes error handling for division by zero.\n4. `main()`: This function calls the other functions in sequence to get user input, validate the operation, perform the operation, and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Valid input: Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` as the operation. The program will output `10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0`.\n* Invalid input: Enter `abc` as the first number. The program will output `Invalid input. Please enter a number.` and prompt the user to enter a valid number.\n* Division by zero: Enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and `/` as the operation. The program will output `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`.",
