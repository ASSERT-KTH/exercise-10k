  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a character from the string and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_char_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where each key is a character from the string and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = count_char_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_char_frequency` function initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the character frequencies.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, it increments the corresponding frequency by 1. Otherwise, it adds the character to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a string, calls the `count_char_frequency` function, and prints the resulting dictionary.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter a string: Hello World\nCharacter Frequency:\nH: 1\ne: 1\nl: 3\no: 2\n : 1\nW: 1\nr: 1\nd: 1\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it efficient for large strings.\n* The program uses a dictionary to store the character frequencies, which allows for fast lookups and insertions.\n* The program handles duplicate characters correctly by incrementing the frequency of each character as it appears in the string.",
