  "prompt": "Write a program to demonstrate the basics of network programming using sockets.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple example of a client-server program using sockets in Python.\n\n### Server Side (server.py)\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_server():\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Define the server's IP address and port\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 12345\n\n    # Bind the socket to the host and port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Accept an incoming connection\n        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Connection from {address} established\")\n\n        # Receive data from the client\n        data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()\n        print(f\"Received message from client: {data}\")\n\n        # Send a response back to the client\n        response = \"Hello from server!\"\n        client_socket.send(response.encode())\n\n        # Close the client socket\n        client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_server()\n```\n\n### Client Side (client.py)\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_client():\n    # Create a socket object\n    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Define the server's IP address and port\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 12345\n\n    # Connect to the server\n    client_socket.connect((host, port))\n    print(f\"Connected to server {host}:{port}\")\n\n    # Send a message to the server\n    message = \"Hello from client!\"\n    client_socket.send(message.encode())\n\n    # Receive a response from the server\n    response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()\n    print(f\"Received response from server: {response}\")\n\n    # Close the client socket\n    client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_client()\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n1. Run the server by executing `python server.py` in your terminal.\n2. Open a new terminal window and run the client by executing `python client.py`.\n3. The client will send a message to the server, and the server will respond with a message.\n4. The messages will be printed to the console in both the server and client terminals.\n\n### Explanation\n* The `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)` line creates a new socket object.\n* The `bind()` method binds the socket to a specific IP address and port.\n* The `listen()` method tells the socket to listen for incoming connections.\n* The `accept()` method accepts an incoming connection and returns a new socket object representing the connection.\n* The `connect()` method connects a socket to a remote server.\n* The `send()` and `recv()` methods are used to send and receive data over the socket.\n* The `close()` method closes a socket.",
