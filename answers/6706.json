  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a number as input and returns the product of its digits.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef product_of_digits(n):\n    product = 1\n    for digit in str(n):\n        product *= int(digit)\n    return product\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nprint(\"The product of its digits is:\", product_of_digits(num))\n```\n\nHere's how this program works:\n\n1. It defines a function `product_of_digits(n)` that calculates the product of the digits of a given number `n`.\n2. It converts the number into a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit.\n3. For each digit in the string, it multiplies the current product by the digit (converted back into an integer).\n4. It asks the user to enter a number.\n5. It calls the `product_of_digits` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\nExample use case:\n\n- If the user enters `123`, the program will calculate `1 * 2 * 3 = 6` and print `The product of its digits is: 6`.",
