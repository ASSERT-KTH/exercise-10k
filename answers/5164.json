  "answer": "Of course! I'll provide a function to delete a key from a dictionary and explain how it works. This function will also handle cases where the key does not exist in the dictionary. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef delete_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes a key from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary from which to delete the key.\n        key: The key to be deleted.\n\n    Raises:\n        KeyError: If the key does not exist in the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The modified dictionary with the key deleted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary\n    # If it does not exist, we raise a KeyError with a descriptive message\n    if key not in dictionary:\n        raise KeyError(f\"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n    # If the key exists, we use the del statement to delete it from the dictionary\n    # This will remove the key-value pair from the dictionary\n    del dictionary[key]\n\n    # Finally, we return the modified dictionary\n    return dictionary\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\nprint(delete_key(my_dict, \"a\"))  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `delete_key` checks if the `key` exists in the `dictionary` using the `in` operator. If the key does not exist, it raises a `KeyError` with a descriptive message.\n* If the `key` exists, the function uses the `del` statement to delete the key-value pair from the `dictionary`.\n* The function then returns the modified `dictionary`.\n* In the example usage, we create a dictionary `my_dict` and call the `delete_key` function to delete the key `'a'`. The function returns the modified dictionary, which is printed to the console.",
