  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Think of a number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the program will tell them if their guess is too high or too low.\n4. The user can continue guessing until they find the correct number.\n5. The program will keep track of the number of tries the user has made and congratulate them when they find the correct number.\n\n**Note:** The user can type \"quit\" at any time to give up and see the correct answer.",
