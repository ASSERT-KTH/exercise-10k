  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in %).\n        years (int): The number of years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    rate = rate / 100  # Convert rate from % to decimal\n    compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** years - principal\n    return compound_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (%): \"))\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, years)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: ${compound_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount after {years} years is: ${principal + compound_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and print the compound interest and the total amount after the specified number of years.\n\nExample:\n```\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the interest rate (%): 5\nEnter the number of years: 5\nThe compound interest is: $276.28\nThe total amount after 5 years is: $1276.28\n```",
