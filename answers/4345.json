  "prompt": "Write a program that checks the day of the week (1-7) and prints the corresponding day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.)",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef print_day_of_week(day):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the day of the week corresponding to the given day number (1-7).\n    \n    Args:\n        day (int): The day of the week (1-7), where 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday.\n    \"\"\"\n    days_of_week = {\n        1: \"Monday\",\n        2: \"Tuesday\",\n        3: \"Wednesday\",\n        4: \"Thursday\",\n        5: \"Friday\",\n        6: \"Saturday\",\n        7: \"Sunday\"\n    }\n\n    if day in days_of_week:\n        print(days_of_week[day])\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day of the week (1-7): \"))\n    print_day_of_week(day)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `print_day_of_week` function takes an integer `day` as input, representing the day of the week (1-7).\n2. It uses a dictionary `days_of_week` to map day numbers to their corresponding day names.\n3. If the input `day` is in the `days_of_week` dictionary, it prints the corresponding day name.\n4. If the input `day` is not in the dictionary (i.e., it's not between 1 and 7), it prints an error message.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates example usage by prompting the user to enter a day number and then calling `print_day_of_week` with the user's input.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `day_of_week.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python day_of_week.py`). When prompted, enter a day number between 1 and 7 to see the corresponding day name.",
