  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function takes a string as input, removes all duplicate characters, and returns the resulting string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes all duplicate characters from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    input_string (str): The input string from which to remove duplicates.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The input string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    \n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            result.append(char)\n            seen.add(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Original string:\", input_str)\n    print(\"String with duplicates removed:\", remove_duplicates(input_str))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of characters we've already encountered.\n2. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, we check if it's already in the `seen` set. If not, we add it to the `result` list and the `seen` set.\n4. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we're scanning the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might have to store all characters in the `result` list and the `seen` set.",
