  "answer": "### Calculating Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation\n#### Description\nThis program will ask the user for a list of numbers, then calculate and print the mean, median, and standard deviation of the input numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport statistics\n\ndef get_numbers_from_user():\n    \"\"\"Get a list of numbers from the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            numbers = [float(x) for x in input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \").split()]\n            if len(numbers) == 0:\n                print(\"Please enter at least one number.\")\n                continue\n            return numbers\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.\")\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    std_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers) if len(numbers) > 1 else 0\n    return mean, median, std_dev\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = get_numbers_from_user()\n    mean, median, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n3. The program will print the mean, median, and standard deviation of the input numbers.\n\n#### Example\n```\nEnter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5\nMean: 3.0\nMedian: 3\nStandard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951\n```",
