  "prompt": "Design a program to perform integer division (e.g., 17 divided by 5 is 3) and calculate the remainder.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple C++ program that performs integer division and calculates the remainder.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to perform integer division and calculate remainder\nvoid divideAndCalculateRemainder(int dividend, int divisor) {\n    if (divisor == 0) {\n        cout << \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" << endl;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    int quotient = dividend / divisor;\n    int remainder = dividend % divisor;\n\n    cout << \"Division: \" << dividend << \" / \" << divisor << \" = \" << quotient << endl;\n    cout << \"Remainder: \" << remainder << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int dividend, divisor;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the dividend: \";\n    cin >> dividend;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the divisor: \";\n    cin >> divisor;\n\n    divideAndCalculateRemainder(dividend, divisor);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `divideAndCalculateRemainder` function takes two parameters, `dividend` and `divisor`, and checks if the `divisor` is zero to prevent division by zero errors.\n*   It calculates the quotient using integer division (`/`) and the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n*   The results are then printed to the console.\n*   In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the dividend and divisor, which are passed to the `divideAndCalculateRemainder` function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Valid Division:** If you enter `17` as the dividend and `5` as the divisor, the program will output:\n\n    ```\nDivision: 17 / 5 = 3\nRemainder: 2\n```\n\n*   **Division by Zero:** If you enter `17` as the dividend and `0` as the divisor, the program will output:\n\n    ```\nError: Division by zero is not allowed.\n```",
