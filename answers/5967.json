  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a mapping function as input, and returns a new array that contains the results of applying the mapping function to each element of the input array.",
  "answer": "Here's the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nconst map = (array, mapping) => {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    result.push(mapping(array[i], i));\n  }\n  return result;\n};\n```\nLet me explain what's going on:\n\n* We define a function `map` that takes two arguments: `array` and `mapping`.\n* We initialize an empty array `result` that will store the results of applying the `mapping` function to each element of the `array`.\n* We use a `for` loop to iterate over each element of the `array`. The loop variable `i` keeps track of the index of the current element.\n* Inside the loop, we apply the `mapping` function to the current element `array[i]` and its index `i`, and push the resulting value to the `result` array using `result.push()`.\n* After the loop finishes, we return the `result` array, which now contains the results of applying the `mapping` function to each element of the `array`.\n\nThis code meets all the specifications outlined in the problem statement. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain anything in more detail!",
