  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers and an index as input, and returns the value at that index in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\nconst func = (arr, index) => {\n  return arr[index];\n};\n\nconsole.log(func(arr, 3));\nconsole.log(func(arr, 7));\n```\nThis code defines an array `arr` with 10 integers from 1 to 10, defines a function `func` that takes two arguments `arr` and `index`, returns the value at the specified `index` in the `arr` array, and logs the results of calling `func` with `arr` and `3` and `arr` and `7` as arguments.\n\nThe output of this code will be:\n```\n4\n8\n```\nWhich is the value at index 3 and 7 in the `arr` array, respectively.",
