  "answer": "### Reversing an Array without Built-in Functions\n\nHere is a Python function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reversed array. This function does not use any built-in reverse functions.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef reverse_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses the input array without using built-in reverse functions.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The reversed array.\n    \"\"\"\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        # Swap the elements at the left and right indices\n        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n        # Move the left and right indices towards the center\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    reversed_arr = reverse_array(arr)\n    print(\"Reversed array:\", reversed_arr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2. Loop until `left` is no longer less than `right`.\n3. Inside the loop, swap the elements at the `left` and `right` indices using tuple assignment.\n4. Increment `left` and decrement `right` to move the pointers towards the center of the array.\n5. Once the loop finishes, the array has been reversed in place.\n6. Return the reversed array.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n/2), where n is the length of the array. Since we drop constant factors in Big O notation, the time complexity simplifies to O(n). The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers and temporary swap values.",
