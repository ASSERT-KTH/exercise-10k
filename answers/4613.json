  "answer": "**Cylinder Volume Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, \u03c0 (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative\")\n\n    volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = 5.0  # in units (e.g., meters, centimeters)\n    height = 10.0  # in units (e.g., meters, centimeters)\n\n    volume = calculate_cylinder_volume(radius, height)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cylinder is {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cylinder_volume` function takes two arguments: `radius` and `height`.\n2. It checks if both `radius` and `height` are non-negative, raising a `ValueError` if either is negative.\n3. The volume is calculated using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where `math.pi` is used for the value of pi.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage, calculating the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 5.0 units and a height of 10.0 units.\n5. The result is printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `cylinder_volume.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python cylinder_volume.py`). The program will output the calculated volume of the cylinder.",
