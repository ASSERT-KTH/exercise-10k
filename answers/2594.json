  "answer": "**Missing Number Finder Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the missing number in a given sequence of numbers. It assumes that the sequence is a consecutive series of integers with one number missing.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in a given sequence of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of integers representing the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the sequence in ascending order\n    sequence.sort()\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence to find the missing number\n    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1):\n        # If the difference between two consecutive numbers is greater than 1, \n        # then there is a missing number\n        if sequence[i + 1] - sequence[i] > 1:\n            # The missing number is the one that would come after the current number\n            return sequence[i] + 1\n\n    # If no missing number is found, return None\n    return None\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)\n\n    if missing_number is not None:\n        print(f\"The missing number in the sequence is: {missing_number}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No missing number found in the sequence.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_missing_number` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the missing number in the sequence.\n2. The function first sorts the input sequence in ascending order.\n3. Then, it iterates through the sequence to find the missing number by checking the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.\n4. If the difference is greater than 1, it means there is a missing number, and the function returns the missing number.\n5. If no missing number is found, the function returns None.\n6. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `find_missing_number` function with an example sequence.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the missing number in a sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`\n* Find the missing number in a sequence: `[10, 11, 12, 14, 15]`\n* Find the missing number in a sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input sequence is a list of integers and that there is only one missing number in the sequence. If the sequence has multiple missing numbers or non-integer values, the program may not work as expected.",
