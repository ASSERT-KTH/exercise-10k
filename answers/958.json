  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to calculate the GCD of two numbers, and it can be easily implemented using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(num1, num2):\n    # Ensure that num1 is the larger number\n    if num2 > num1:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1\n    \n    # Calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm\n    while num2 != 0:\n        remainder = num1 % num2\n        num1 = num2\n        num2 = remainder\n    \n    return num1\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = 48\nnum2 = 18\ngcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Ensure the Correct Order of Numbers**: Before calculating the GCD, we first check if `num2` is greater than `num1`. If so, we swap them to ensure that `num1` is always the larger number. This is necessary because the Euclidean algorithm requires the larger number to be divided by the smaller number.\n2.  **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**: We then use a while loop to apply the Euclidean algorithm. Inside the loop, we calculate the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2` and store it in the `remainder` variable.\n3.  **Update Numbers for the Next Iteration**: After calculating the remainder, we update `num1` and `num2` for the next iteration. We set `num1` to the current value of `num2` and `num2` to the remainder. This process continues until `num2` becomes zero.\n4.  **Return the GCD**: Once `num2` becomes zero, `num1` will hold the GCD of the original two numbers. We return `num1` as the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Calculating the GCD of Two Numbers**: The provided code calculates the GCD of 48 and 18, which is 6.\n*   **Using the Function with Different Inputs**: You can call the `calculate_gcd` function with different pairs of numbers to find their GCD. For example, `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns 6, and `calculate_gcd(12, 15)` returns 3.",
