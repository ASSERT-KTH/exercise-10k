  "answer": "**Fibonacci Generator Function**\n================================\n\nHere's a Python generator function that yields the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generator function that yields the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The next number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while True:\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    fib = fibonacci()\n    for _ in range(10):\n        print(next(fib))\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The function initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.\n2. The `while True` loop ensures that the function will continue to yield values indefinitely.\n3. The `yield a` statement produces the current value of `a` and suspends the function's execution.\n4. The `a, b = b, a + b` statement updates the values of `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence.\n5. When the function is resumed, it yields the new value of `a` and repeats the process.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nRunning the example code will print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n34\n```",
