  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Get the two numbers from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the difference\ndifference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The difference between {:.2f} and {:.2f} is {:.2f}\".format(num1, num2, difference))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_difference` that takes two numbers `num1` and `num2` as input and returns their difference.\n2. We use the built-in `input` function to get the two numbers from the user.\n3. We call the `calculate_difference` function with the two numbers and store the result in the `difference` variable.\n4. We print the difference to the console, formatting the numbers to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `10` and `5`, the program will output `The difference between 10.00 and 5.00 is 5.00`.\n* If the user enters `20` and `30`, the program will output `The difference between 20.00 and 30.00 is -10.00`.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter valid numbers. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric input.",
