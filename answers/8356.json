  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a user's name and age as input, then outputs a greeting message with the user's name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years. The program should also handle invalid age inputs and prompt the user to enter a valid age.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in Python that meets the provided specification:\n\n```python\nname = input('Enter your name: ')\nage = input('Enter your age: ')\n\nwhile not age.isdigit():\n    print('Invalid age. Please enter a valid age.')\n    age = input('Enter your age: ')\n\nage = int(age)\n\nage_in_five_years = age + 5\n\nprint(f'Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.')\nprint(f'You will be {age_in_five_years} years old in 5 years.')\n```\n\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification. It first prompts the user for their name and age, then checks if the age input is valid. If not, it prompts the user to re-enter a valid age. Once a valid age is entered, it calculates the user's age in 5 years and prints out two greeting messages.",
