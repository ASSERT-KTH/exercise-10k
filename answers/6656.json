  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD:\n\t* If `b` is zero, the GCD is `a`.\n\t* Otherwise, replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n3. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the GCD of 12 and 15: `gcd(12, 15)` returns 3.\n* Find the GCD of 24 and 30: `gcd(24, 30)` returns 6.\n\nNote: This program uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two integers. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log min(a, b)), making it suitable for large inputs.",
