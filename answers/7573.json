  "prompt": "Create a function that uses debugging techniques such as print statements or a debugger to diagnose issues.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll provide a comprehensive solution to help you create a function that leverages debugging techniques to diagnose issues in your code. This solution will utilize print statements to identify and report problems. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef debug_function(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list as an input, checks if all elements are integers, \n    and returns the sum of all integers in the list. It uses print statements \n    to diagnose issues during execution.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): A list containing elements to be summed.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list. If not, we print an error message.\n    if not isinstance(input_list, list):\n        print(\"Error: Input is not a list.\")\n        return None\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0.\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list.\n    for i, element in enumerate(input_list):\n        # Print the current element being processed for debugging purposes.\n        print(f\"Processing element {i+1}: {element}\")\n\n        # Check if the current element is an integer.\n        if not isinstance(element, int):\n            # If not, print an error message and continue to the next element.\n            print(f\"Error: Element {i+1} is not an integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        # If the element is an integer, add it to the total sum.\n        total_sum += element\n        # Print the updated total sum for debugging purposes.\n        print(f\"Updated total sum: {total_sum}\")\n\n    # After processing all elements, print the final total sum.\n    print(f\"Final total sum: {total_sum}\")\n\n    # Return the total sum.\n    return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(debug_function([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15\nprint(debug_function([1, 'a', 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 13\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `debug_function` takes an input list, checks if it's a list, and returns the sum of all integers in the list. It uses print statements to diagnose issues during execution.\n* Inside the function, we iterate over each element in the input list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element. We print the current element being processed for debugging purposes.\n* For each element, we check if it's an integer using `isinstance`. If not, we print an error message and skip to the next element using `continue`.\n* Finally, we return the total sum of all integers in the input list, providing a clear result of the function's execution.",
