  "prompt": "Create a program that generates an arithmetic progression with a given first term, common difference, and number of terms.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that creates an arithmetic progression based on the given parameters:\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic progression.\n\n    Parameters:\n    first_term (float): The first term of the progression.\n    common_difference (float): The difference between each term in the progression.\n    num_terms (int): The number of terms in the progression.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of numbers representing the arithmetic progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_terms <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of terms must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    progression = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(num_terms)]\n    return progression\n\n\ndef main():\n    first_term = float(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_difference = float(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    try:\n        progression = generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)\n        print(\"Arithmetic Progression:\")\n        print(progression)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_arithmetic_progression` function takes in three parameters: `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `num_terms`.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to generate the arithmetic progression, where each term is calculated as `first_term + i * common_difference` for `i` ranging from 0 to `num_terms - 1`.\n*   The `main` function prompts the user to input the first term, common difference, and number of terms, and then calls the `generate_arithmetic_progression` function to generate and print the progression.\n*   The program includes error handling to ensure that the number of terms is a positive integer.",
