  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks the strength of a given password based on the following criteria:\n- At least 8 characters\n- At least one uppercase letter\n- At least one lowercase letter\n- At least one digit\n- At least one special character\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    # Define the criteria\n    criteria = {\n        \"length\": len(password) >= 8,\n        \"uppercase\": any(char.isupper() for char in password),\n        \"lowercase\": any(char.islower() for char in password),\n        \"digit\": any(char.isdigit() for char in password),\n        \"special_char\": re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password) is not None\n    }\n\n    # Check each criterion\n    if criteria[\"length\"] and criteria[\"uppercase\"] and criteria[\"lowercase\"] and criteria[\"digit\"] and criteria[\"special_char\"]:\n        print(\"Password is strong.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is weak. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:\")\n        if not criteria[\"length\"]:\n            print(\"- At least 8 characters.\")\n        if not criteria[\"uppercase\"]:\n            print(\"- At least one uppercase letter.\")\n        if not criteria[\"lowercase\"]:\n            print(\"- At least one lowercase letter.\")\n        if not criteria[\"digit\"]:\n            print(\"- At least one digit.\")\n        if not criteria[\"special_char\"]:\n            print(\"- At least one special character.\")\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    check_password_strength(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Enter a strong password (e.g., `P@ssw0rd`) to see the \"Password is strong.\" message.\n- Enter a weak password (e.g., `password`) to see the \"Password is weak.\" message along with the criteria that are not met.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a function `check_password_strength` that takes a password as input and checks its strength based on the given criteria.\n2. It uses a dictionary `criteria` to store the results of each check.\n3. The `any` function and generator expressions are used to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.\n4. A regular expression is used to check for special characters.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a password and calls the `check_password_strength` function to check its strength.\n6. The program prints a message indicating whether the password is strong or weak, along with any criteria that are not met.",
