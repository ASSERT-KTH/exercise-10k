  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the amount after compounding given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the amount after compounding.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The rate of interest as a decimal.\n        time (float): The time the money is invested for in years.\n        n (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The amount after compounding.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the rate of interest as a percentage: \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time in years: \"))\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year (default is 1): \") or 1)\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)\n    print(f\"The amount after {time} years is: ${amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount when prompted.\n3. Enter the rate of interest as a percentage when prompted.\n4. Enter the time in years when prompted.\n5. Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year when prompted (press enter for default value of 1).\n6. The program will display the amount after compounding.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The formula used for compound interest is `A = P * (1 + r/n) ^ (nt)`, where:\n\t+ A is the amount after compounding.\n\t+ P is the principal amount.\n\t+ r is the rate of interest.\n\t+ n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n\t+ t is the time in years.\n* The program uses the `float` type to handle decimal numbers and the `int` type to handle integer values.\n* The program uses the `input` function to get user input and the `print` function to display the result.\n* The program uses a `main` function to organize the code and a `calculate_compound_interest` function to perform the calculation.",
