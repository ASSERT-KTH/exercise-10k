  "answer": "### Generating a Random Password\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function generates a random password of a specified length. The password will contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport string\nimport secrets\n\ndef generate_password(length: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password of the specified length.\n\n    Args:\n    length (int): The length of the password to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A random password of the specified length.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length < 8:\n        raise ValueError(\"Password length should be at least 8 characters\")\n\n    # Define the character set for the password\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n\n    # Generate the password\n    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))\n\n    return password\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 12  # Change this to your desired password length\n    print(generate_password(length))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n* The `generate_password` function takes an integer `length` as input and returns a random password of that length.\n* The function uses the `secrets` module, which is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.\n* The `string` module is used to define the character set for the password, which includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n* The function checks if the password length is at least 8 characters and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to generate a password of a specified length. You can change the `length` variable to your desired password length.",
