  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses nested for loops to print a 5x5 circle pattern of asterisks (*):\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_circle_pattern(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a circle pattern of asterisks (*) of the given size.\n\n    Args:\n        size (int): The size of the circle pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the center of the circle\n    center = size // 2\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the pattern\n    for y in range(size):\n        # Iterate over each column in the pattern\n        for x in range(size):\n            # Calculate the distance from the current point to the center of the circle\n            distance = math.sqrt((x - center) ** 2 + (y - center) ** 2)\n\n            # If the distance is less than or equal to the radius, print an asterisk\n            if distance <= center:\n                print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, print a space\n                print(\" \", end=\" \")\n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nprint_circle_pattern(5)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print a 5x5 circle pattern of asterisks (*). You can adjust the size of the circle by passing a different value to the `print_circle_pattern` function.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the program works:\n\n*   The `print_circle_pattern` function takes an integer `size` as input, representing the size of the circle pattern.\n*   The function calculates the center of the circle by dividing the `size` by 2 and taking the integer part.\n*   The function uses two nested for loops to iterate over each point in the 2D grid.\n*   For each point, it calculates the distance from the point to the center of the circle using the Pythagorean theorem.\n*   If the distance is less than or equal to the radius (which is `center` in this case), the function prints an asterisk (*).\n*   Otherwise, it prints a space.\n*   After iterating over all points in the grid, the function prints a newline character to move to the next line.\n\nThe resulting output will be a circle pattern of asterisks (*) with the specified size.",
