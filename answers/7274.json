  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints out a personalized greeting message. The program should prompt the user to enter their name, store the input in a variable, and then use that variable to construct the greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specification:\n```\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\nLet me explain how this code meets the specification:\n\n1. The first line uses the `input()` function to prompt the user to enter their name. The string \"Enter your name: \" is displayed to the user, and the user's input is stored in the `name` variable.\n2. The second line uses the `print()` function to print out a personalized greeting message. The message is constructed by concatenating the strings \"Hello, \", the value of the `name` variable, and \"!\".\n\nFor example, if the user enters \"Alice\", the output will be:\n```\nHello, Alice!\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified, including:\n\n* Prompting the user to enter their name\n* Storing the user's input in a variable\n* Printing out a personalized greeting message\n* Using the `input()` and `print()` functions\n* Concatenating strings to construct the greeting message",
