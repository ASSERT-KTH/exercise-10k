  "prompt": "Write a function to suggest friends for a given user based on their mutual friends. The function should take a dictionary of friendships and a user as input, and return a list of suggested friends.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef suggest_friends(friendships, user):\n    suggested_friends = []\n    \n    for person, friends in friendships.items():\n        if person in friendships[user]:\n            for friend in friends:\n                if friend not in friendships[user] and friend not in suggested_friends:\n                    suggested_friends.append(friend)\n    \n    return suggested_friends\n\nfriendships = {\n    \"Alice\": [\"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\n    \"Bob\": [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\", \"Dave\"],\n    \"Charlie\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Dave\"],\n    \"Dave\": [\"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n}\n\nsuggested_friends = suggest_friends(friendships, \"Alice\")\nprint(suggested_friends)\n```\nThis code defines the `suggest_friends` function, which takes a dictionary `friendships` and a user `user` as input, and returns a list of suggested friends. The function iterates over each person's friends in the `friendships` dictionary, checks if the person is a friend of the given user, and if so, adds their friends to the list of suggested friends. Finally, the code creates a sample `friendships` dictionary and calls the `suggest_friends` function with the user \"Alice\", printing the resulting list of suggested friends.",
