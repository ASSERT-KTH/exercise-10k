  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean Algorithm**\n===========================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        # Replace 'a' with 'b' and 'b' with the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd(num1, num2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `gcd(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The while loop continues until `b` becomes zero.\n3. In each iteration, `a` is replaced by `b` and `b` is replaced by the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`).\n4. Once `b` becomes zero, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n5. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the GCD of 48 and 18: `gcd(48, 18)` returns 6\n* Find the GCD of 24 and 30: `gcd(24, 30)` returns 6\n* Find the GCD of 17 and 5: `gcd(17, 5)` returns 1\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you need to find the GCD of floating-point numbers, you will need to modify the algorithm accordingly.",
