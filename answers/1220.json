  "prompt": "Write a function that checks if a given list is sorted in ascending order.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to check if a given list is sorted in ascending order and provide a clear explanation of the code. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_sorted(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given list is sorted in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the list is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # If the list is empty or contains only one element, it's considered sorted\n    if len(lst) <= 1:\n        return True\n\n    # Initialize a variable to store the previous element in the list\n    # We start with the first element in the list\n    previous_element = lst[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element\n    for current_element in lst[1:]:\n        # If the current element is less than the previous element, the list is not sorted\n        if current_element < previous_element:\n            return False\n        \n        # Update the previous element for the next iteration\n        previous_element = current_element\n\n    # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found any unsorted pairs, the list is sorted\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_sorted` checks if the input list `lst` is sorted in ascending order by iterating over the list and comparing each element with its previous one.\n* If the list is empty or contains only one element, it is considered sorted, so the function returns `True` immediately.\n* The function uses a `previous_element` variable to keep track of the previous element in the list, starting with the first element `lst[0]`.\n* If any pair of adjacent elements is found to be unsorted (i.e., `current_element < previous_element`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.",
