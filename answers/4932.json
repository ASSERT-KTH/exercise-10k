  "answer": "**Distance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time. It uses the formula `distance = speed * time` to perform the calculation.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distance(speed, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the distance traveled given the speed and time.\n\n    Args:\n        speed (float): The speed of the object in units per second.\n        time (float): The time traveled in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance traveled in units.\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = speed * time\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for speed and time\n    speed = float(input(\"Enter the speed in units per second: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the distance\n    distance = calculate_distance(speed, time)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The distance traveled is {distance} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the speed in units per second when prompted (e.g., 50).\n3. Enter the time in seconds when prompted (e.g., 10).\n4. The program will print the calculated distance (e.g., 500 units).\n\n### Note\n\n* This program assumes that the speed and time are given in compatible units (e.g., meters per second and seconds).\n* The program does not perform any error checking on the user input. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to ensure that the input values are valid.",
