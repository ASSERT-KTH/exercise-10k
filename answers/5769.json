  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the day of the week as input and prints out the corresponding day number (Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, ..., Sunday = 7).",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef findDay(date):\n    days = [\"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\", \"sunday\"]\n    return days.index(date.lower()) + 1\n\ndate = input(\"Enter day of the week: \")\nprint(findDay(date))\n```\nNote that I added the `.lower()` method to the `date` parameter in the `findDay` function to ensure that the input is case-insensitive. This way, the program can handle inputs like \"Monday\", \"monday\", \"MONDAY\", etc.",
