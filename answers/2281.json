  "prompt": "Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console when executed.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `main` function is defined, which contains the code to be executed when the program starts.\n- Inside the `main` function, the `print` function is used to print 'Hello, World!' to the console.\n- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` line checks if the script is being run directly or being imported. If it's being run directly, the `main` function is called.\n\n### Example Use Case\nTo run this program, save it in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello.py`. Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the program using the command `python hello.py`. You should see 'Hello, World!' printed to the console.",
