  "answer": "**Password Generation Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThe following function generates a random password of a specified length. It uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to create a strong password.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password of a specified length.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the character sets to use\n    uppercase_letters = string.ascii_uppercase\n    lowercase_letters = string.ascii_lowercase\n    digits = string.digits\n    special_characters = string.punctuation\n\n    # Combine the character sets\n    all_characters = uppercase_letters + lowercase_letters + digits + special_characters\n\n    # Ensure the password includes at least one character from each set\n    password = [\n        random.choice(uppercase_letters),\n        random.choice(lowercase_letters),\n        random.choice(digits),\n        random.choice(special_characters),\n    ]\n\n    # Fill the rest of the password with random characters\n    for _ in range(length - 4):\n        password.append(random.choice(all_characters))\n\n    # Shuffle the password to avoid the first characters always being from the same set\n    random.shuffle(password)\n\n    # Join the password into a single string\n    return ''.join(password)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    password_length = 12\n    generated_password = generate_password(password_length)\n    print(f\"Generated password of length {password_length}: {generated_password}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes an integer `length` as input, representing the desired length of the password.\n2. It defines four character sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n3. The function ensures the password includes at least one character from each set by selecting one random character from each set.\n4. It fills the rest of the password with random characters from the combined character set.\n5. The password is shuffled to avoid the first characters always being from the same set.\n6. Finally, the function returns the generated password as a single string.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this function, simply call `generate_password(length)` with the desired password length as an argument. The function will return a random password of the specified length.",
