  "answer": "### Removing Duplicate Characters from a String\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate characters from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A new string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"Programming\"\n    print(\"Original String:\", input_str)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_str))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the characters we have encountered so far.\n2. We create an empty list `result` to store the characters without duplicates.\n3. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. If the character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and append it to the `result` list.\n5. Finally, we join all the characters in the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating over the string once. The set operations (addition and lookup) have an average time complexity of O(1), making the overall time complexity linear.",
