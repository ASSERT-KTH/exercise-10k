  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the absolute difference between them.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef absolute_difference(num1, num2):\n    return abs(num1 - num2)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = absolute_difference(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The absolute difference between the two numbers is: \", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `absolute_difference` function takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`.\n* It calculates the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` using the built-in `abs` function.\n* In the example usage, we first prompt the user to enter two numbers.\n* We then call the `absolute_difference` function with these numbers and print the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Define a function**: Define a function `absolute_difference` that takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`.\n2. **Calculate absolute difference**: Inside the function, use the `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2`.\n3. **Get user input**: Prompt the user to enter two numbers using the `input` function.\n4. **Call the function**: Call the `absolute_difference` function with the user-input numbers.\n5. **Print the result**: Print the absolute difference between the two numbers.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle potential errors, such as non-numeric input.\n* Consider adding input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers.\n* You can also use this function as a building block for more complex calculations.",
