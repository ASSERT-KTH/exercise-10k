  "answer": "**Euclidean Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nHere's an example implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers in Python:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero. At that point, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Start with two numbers `a` and `b`.\n2. If `b` is zero, return `a` as the GCD.\n3. Otherwise, replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `b` is zero.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nIn the example code, we define a function `gcd` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. We then demonstrate the function's usage by calculating the GCD of 48 and 18, which is 6.",
