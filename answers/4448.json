  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user. The computer generates a random choice and the user inputs their choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the user's choice\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Returns the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n       (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will generate the computer's random choice and determine the winner.\n4. The result will be printed to the console.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `random` module to generate the computer's choice.\n* The `get_user_choice` function ensures that the user's input is valid.\n* The `determine_winner` function uses a simple set of rules to determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.",
