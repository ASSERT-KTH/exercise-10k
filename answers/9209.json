  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input, checks if the age is within the valid range (18-120), and then prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is invalid, print an error message and ask for input again.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string NAME;\n    int age;\n\n    cout << \"Enter your name: \";\n    cin >> NAME;\n\n    cout << \"Enter your age: \";\n    cin >> age;\n\n    if (age < 18 || age > 120) {\n        cout << \"Invalid age. Please enter an age between 18 and 120.\" << endl;\n        cout << \"Enter your age again: \";\n        cin >> age;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Hello, \" << NAME << \"!\" << endl;\n    cout << \"You are \" << age << \" years old.\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header file, uses the `using namespace std` directive, and defines a `main` function that takes no arguments. It then declares variables for the user's name and age, prompts the user to enter their name and age, checks if the age is valid, and prints out a greeting message with the user's name and age. If the age is invalid, it asks the user to enter their age again.",
