  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a given formula. The formula should be: sequence[n] = 2 * sequence[n-1] + 1, where sequence[0] = 1.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates a sequence of numbers based on the given formula:\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a sequence of numbers based on the formula: sequence[n] = 2 * sequence[n-1] + 1,\n    where sequence[0] = 1.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [1]  # Initialize the sequence with the first term\n\n    # Generate the rest of the sequence\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        next_term = 2 * sequence[i - 1] + 1\n        sequence.append(next_term)\n\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    n = 10  # Number of terms in the sequence\n    sequence = generate_sequence(n)\n    print(\"Sequence:\", sequence)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the sequence.\n*   It initializes the sequence with the first term, which is 1.\n*   Then, it generates the rest of the sequence using a loop, applying the formula `sequence[n] = 2 * sequence[n-1] + 1` for each term.\n*   Finally, it returns the generated sequence as a list.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `generate_sequence` by generating a sequence of 10 terms and printing the result.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can adjust the value of `n` in the `main` function to generate sequences of different lengths.\n*   If you want to generate a sequence with a different initial term or formula, you can modify the `generate_sequence` function accordingly.",
