  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of the even numbers. If the list contains an odd number greater than 10, raise a ValueError.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function that calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a list while checking for odd numbers greater than 10. This response will guide you through the implementation of this function. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a given list.\n    If the list contains an odd number greater than 10, it raises a ValueError.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of even numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list contains an odd number greater than 10.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd and greater than 10\n        if num % 2 != 0 and num > 10:\n            # If the condition is met, raise a ValueError\n            raise ValueError(\"The list contains an odd number greater than 10\")\n\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # If the number is even, calculate its square and add it to the total sum\n            total_sum += num ** 2\n\n    # Return the total sum after iterating over all numbers in the list\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sum_of_squares_of_even_numbers` initializes a variable `total_sum` to store the sum of squares of even numbers.\n* It iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`, checking if `num` is an odd number greater than 10. If so, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* For even numbers, it calculates the square of `num` using `num ** 2` and adds it to `total_sum`.\n* Finally, the function returns `total_sum` after processing all numbers in the list.",
