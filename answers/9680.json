The `check_string_ending` function prompts the user to enter two strings.\n2. It uses the `str.endswith()` method to check if the first string ends with the second string.\n3. It prints the result to the console.\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `string_ending.py`), then run it using Python (e.g., `python string_ending.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the two strings.",
