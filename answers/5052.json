  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates a geometric progression with a given first term, common ratio, and number of terms:\n\n```python\ndef generate_geometric_progression(first_term, common_ratio, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a geometric progression with a given first term, common ratio, and number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (float): The first term of the geometric progression.\n        common_ratio (float): The common ratio of the geometric progression.\n        num_terms (int): The number of terms in the geometric progression.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers representing the geometric progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    progression = [first_term * (common_ratio ** i) for i in range(num_terms)]\n    return progression\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    first_term = 2\n    common_ratio = 2\n    num_terms = 10\n\n    progression = generate_geometric_progression(first_term, common_ratio, num_terms)\n    print(f\"Geometric Progression: {progression}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `generate_geometric_progression` function takes three arguments: `first_term`, `common_ratio`, and `num_terms`.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to generate the geometric progression. The `i`-th term is calculated as `first_term * (common_ratio ** i)`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num_terms - 1`.\n*   In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `generate_geometric_progression` function with a first term of 2, a common ratio of 2, and 10 terms.\n*   Finally, it prints the generated geometric progression.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program with the provided example, it will output the following geometric progression:\n\n```\nGeometric Progression: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]\n```",
