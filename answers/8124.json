  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year using if/else statements.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses the following rules to determine if a year is a leap year:\n\n* The year must be evenly divisible by 4.\n* If the year is a century year (i.e., it is evenly divisible by 100), it must also be evenly divisible by 400.\n\nThe `is_leap_year` function takes a year as input and checks these conditions using nested if/else statements. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if it is a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g., 2020): The program will print \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2021): The program will print \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000): The program will print \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900): The program will print \"1900 is not a leap year.\"",
