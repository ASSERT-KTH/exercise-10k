  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a for loop to print each key-value pair of a given dictionary.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that prints each key-value pair of a given dictionary using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary\nmy_dict = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n}\n\n# Print each key-value pair of the dictionary\nfor key, value in my_dict.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- We define a dictionary called `my_dict`.\n- We use the `.items()` method of the dictionary to get an iterator over its key-value pairs.\n- We use a for loop to iterate over the key-value pairs, with the `key` variable taking the key and the `value` variable taking the value.\n- We print each key-value pair using an f-string.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print:\n\n```\nname: John\nage: 30\ncity: New York\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:\n\n1. **Define a dictionary**: We create a dictionary called `my_dict` with some keys and values.\n2. **Get the dictionary's items**: We use the `.items()` method of the dictionary to get an iterator over its key-value pairs.\n3. **Loop over the items**: We use a for loop to iterate over the key-value pairs.\n4. **Print each key-value pair**: Inside the loop, we print each key-value pair using an f-string.\n\n### Advice\n\n- Make sure to use the `.items()` method when iterating over a dictionary's key-value pairs.\n- Use meaningful variable names like `key` and `value` to make your code easier to understand.\n- Consider using an f-string to print the key-value pairs, as it makes the code more readable and efficient.",
