  "answer": "### Storing Decimal Numbers in Float Variables and Performing Basic Arithmetic Operations\n#### Overview\nThis guide demonstrates how to store a decimal number in a float variable and perform basic arithmetic operations using Python.\n\n#### Code\n```python\n# Define float variables\nnum1 = 10.5\nnum2 = 2.8\n\n# Basic arithmetic operations\naddition = num1 + num2\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\ndivision = num1 / num2\n\n# Print results\nprint(f\"Number 1: {num1}\")\nprint(f\"Number 2: {num2}\")\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\nprint(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. **Define Float Variables**: We start by defining two float variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them decimal values.\n2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**: We then perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using these variables.\n3. **Print Results**: Finally, we print the results of each operation.\n\n#### Example Output\n```\nNumber 1: 10.5\nNumber 2: 2.8\nAddition: 10.5 + 2.8 = 13.3\nSubtraction: 10.5 - 2.8 = 7.7\nMultiplication: 10.5 * 2.8 = 29.4\nDivision: 10.5 / 2.8 = 3.75\n```\n\n#### Advice\n* Be mindful of the precision of float variables, as they can lead to rounding errors in certain calculations.\n* Consider using the `decimal` module in Python for precise decimal arithmetic.",
