  "answer": "Here's a Python program that prints a pattern of asterisks (*) using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_asterisk_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of asterisks (*) with n rows and n columns.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows and columns in the pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Get the input from the user\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows and columns: \"))\n\n# Call the function to print the pattern\nprint_asterisk_pattern(n)\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `print_asterisk_pattern` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of rows and columns in the pattern.\n2. The outer for loop (`for i in range(n)`) iterates over each row in the pattern.\n3. The inner for loop (`for j in range(n)`) iterates over each column in the pattern and prints an asterisk (*).\n4. The `end=\" \"` argument in the `print` function is used to print all asterisks on the same line, separated by a space.\n5. After each row is printed, the `print()` function is called without any arguments to move to the next line.\n6. The user is prompted to enter the number of rows and columns using the `input` function.\n7. Finally, the `print_asterisk_pattern` function is called with the user's input to print the pattern.\n\nExample use case:\n```\nEnter the number of rows and columns: 5\n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n```",
