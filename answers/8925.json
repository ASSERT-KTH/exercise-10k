  "answer": "**Maximum Gap Program**\n=========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program finds the maximum gap between two elements in a given sorted list of integers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef maximum_gap(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum gap between two elements in a given sorted list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A sorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum gap between two elements.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(nums) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must have at least two elements.\")\n\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        gap = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n\n    return max_gap\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [1, 3, 5, 10, 15]\n    max_gap = maximum_gap(nums)\n    print(\"Maximum gap:\", max_gap)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `maximum_gap` function takes a sorted list of integers as input.\n2. It checks if the input list has at least two elements. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It initializes the `max_gap` variable to 0, which will store the maximum gap found.\n4. It iterates through the input list, starting from the second element (index 1).\n5. For each element, it calculates the gap between the current element and the previous element.\n6. If the calculated gap is greater than the current `max_gap`, it updates `max_gap`.\n7. Finally, it returns the maximum gap found.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since it iterates through the list once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(1), since it uses a constant amount of space to store the `max_gap` variable.",
