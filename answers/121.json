  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis program first defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Then it asks the user for two numbers, calls the `add_numbers` function with these numbers, and prints the result. \n\nYou can also do it in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", num1 + num2)\n```\n\nThis version does exactly the same thing, but without defining a separate function.",
