  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Squares**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1))\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    n = 5\n    result = sum_of_squares(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `sum_of_squares` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to `n`.\n*   The `sum` function is used in combination with a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares.\n*   The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sum_of_squares` function with an example value of `n`.\n\n**Alternative Formula-Based Approach**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you prefer a more mathematical approach, you can use the formula for the sum of squares of integers: `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares_formula(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n using the formula.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    n = 5\n    result = sum_of_squares_formula(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares from 1 to {n} is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis formula-based approach is generally more efficient than the iterative approach, especially for large values of `n`.",
