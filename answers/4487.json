The user inputs their guess, and the function checks if the guess is correct and updates the word accordingly.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\nHANGMAN_PICS = ['''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n /    |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n / \\  |\n      |\n=========''']\n\nWORDS = 'ant baboon badger bat bear beaver camel cat clam cobra cougar coyote crow deer dog donkey duck eagle ferret fox frog goat goose hawk lion lizard llama mole monkey moose mouse mule newt otter owl panda parrot pigeon python rabbit ram rat raven rhino salmon seal shark sheep skunk sloth snake spider stork swan tiger toad trout turkey turtle weasel whale wolf wombat zebra'.split()\n\ndef hangman():\n    word = random.choice(WORDS)\n    word_list = ['_'] * len(word)\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_letters = []\n    guessed_words = []\n    tries = 6\n\n    print(\"Let's play Hangman!\")\n    print(HANGMAN_PICS[0])\n    print(' '.join(word_list))\n\n    while not guessed and tries > 0:\n        guess = input(\"Please guess a letter or word: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_letters:\n                print(\"You already guessed the letter\", guess)\n            elif guess not in word:\n                print(guess, \"is not in the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            else:\n                print(\"Good job,\", guess, \"is in the word!\")\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n                word_as_list = list(word)\n                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n                for index in indices:\n                    word_list[index] = guess\n        elif len(guess) == len(word) and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_words:\n                print(\"You already guessed the word\", guess)\n            elif guess != word:\n                print(guess, \"is not the word.\")\n                tries -= 1\n                guessed_words.append(guess)\n            else:\n                guessed = True\n                word_list = list(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Not a valid guess.\")\n        \n        print(HANGMAN_PICS[6 - tries])\n        print(' '.join(word_list))\n\n    if guessed:\n        print(\"Congratulations, you guessed the word!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, you ran out of tries.

It creates a list `word_list` with underscores representing each letter in the word.\n3. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for a guess until the word is guessed or the user runs out of tries.\n4. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the function updates `word_list` to reveal the correct letter.\n5. If the user guesses a letter that is not in the word, the function decreases the number of tries remaining.\n6. If the user guesses the word correctly, the function ends the game and congratulates the user.\n7. If the user runs out of tries, the function ends the game and reveals the correct word.",
