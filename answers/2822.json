  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The user is prompted to input their choice, and the computer generates a random choice. The winner is determined based on the game's rules and the result is displayed.\n\n### Game Rules\n\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n        elif user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the code.\n2. Enter your choice when prompted (e.g., `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined and displayed.\n4. Type `q` to quit the game.\n\nNote: This code uses the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer. The `determine_winner` function implements the game's rules to determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices. The `main` function provides a simple text-based interface for the user to interact with the game.",
