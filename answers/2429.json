  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate an employee's salary based on their hourly wage and the number of hours worked, using a for loop to handle multiple employees.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate an employee's salary\ndef calculate_salary(hourly_wage, hours_worked):\n    return hourly_wage * hours_worked\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # List to store employee information\n    employees = []\n\n    # Ask the user for the number of employees\n    num_employees = int(input(\"Enter the number of employees: \"))\n\n    # Loop through each employee and ask for their hourly wage and hours worked\n    for i in range(num_employees):\n        print(f\"\\nEnter information for Employee {i + 1}:\")\n        hourly_wage = float(input(\"Enter hourly wage: $\"))\n        hours_worked = float(input(\"Enter hours worked: \"))\n\n        # Calculate the employee's salary\n        salary = calculate_salary(hourly_wage, hours_worked)\n\n        # Store the employee's information and salary\n        employees.append({\n            \"hourly_wage\": hourly_wage,\n            \"hours_worked\": hours_worked,\n            \"salary\": salary\n        })\n\n    # Print out the salary for each employee\n    print(\"\\nEmployee Salaries:\")\n    for i, employee in enumerate(employees):\n        print(f\"Employee {i + 1}:\")\n        print(f\"Hourly Wage: ${employee['hourly_wage']:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Hours Worked: {employee['hours_worked']:.2f} hours\")\n        print(f\"Salary: ${employee['salary']:.2f}\\n\")\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Function to Calculate Salary**: The `calculate_salary` function takes an employee's hourly wage and hours worked as input, and returns their salary.\n2. **Main Function**: The `main` function asks the user for the number of employees, then uses a for loop to ask for each employee's hourly wage and hours worked.\n3. **Calculate and Store Salary**: For each employee, the program calculates their salary using the `calculate_salary` function and stores their information and salary in a list of dictionaries.\n4. **Print Employee Salaries**: Finally, the program prints out the salary for each employee, including their hourly wage, hours worked, and total salary.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter the number of employees, then ask for each employee's hourly wage and hours worked. After you've entered all the employee information, it will print out the salary for each employee.\n\nFor example, if you enter the following information:\n\n* Number of employees: 2\n* Employee 1:\n\t+ Hourly wage: $20.00\n\t+ Hours worked: 40.00\n* Employee 2:\n\t+ Hourly wage: $30.00\n\t+ Hours worked: 30.00\n\nThe program will output:\n\n```\nEmployee Salaries:\nEmployee 1:\nHourly Wage: $20.00\nHours Worked: 40.00 hours\nSalary: $800.00\n\nEmployee 2:\nHourly Wage: $30.00\nHours Worked: 30.00 hours\nSalary: $900.00\n```",
