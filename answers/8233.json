  "answer": "**Ticket Booking Program**\n================================\n\nThis program allows users to book a ticket by providing their details and selecting a seat. It uses if/else statements to validate user input and ensure a smooth booking process.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nclass TicketBooking:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.seats = {\n            \"A1\": False,\n            \"A2\": False,\n            \"B1\": False,\n            \"B2\": False,\n            \"C1\": False,\n            \"C2\": False,\n        }\n\n    def display_seats(self):\n        print(\"Available Seats:\")\n        for seat, booked in self.seats.items():\n            if not booked:\n                print(f\"{seat}\")\n\n    def book_seat(self):\n        self.display_seats()\n        seat = input(\"Enter the seat number you want to book: \")\n        if seat in self.seats:\n            if not self.seats[seat]:\n                name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n                email = input(\"Enter your email: \")\n                phone = input(\"Enter your phone number: \")\n                self.seats[seat] = True\n                print(f\"Seat {seat} booked successfully for {name}!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Seat already booked. Please choose another seat.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid seat number. Please try again.\")\n\n    def cancel_booking(self):\n        seat = input(\"Enter the seat number you want to cancel: \")\n        if seat in self.seats:\n            if self.seats[seat]:\n                self.seats[seat] = False\n                print(f\"Booking for seat {seat} cancelled successfully!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Seat is not booked. No need to cancel.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid seat number. Please try again.\")\n\ndef main():\n    booking = TicketBooking()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\n1. Book a seat\")\n        print(\"2. Cancel a booking\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            booking.book_seat()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            booking.cancel_booking()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program creates a `TicketBooking` class with a dictionary of available seats.\n2. The `display_seats` method prints the available seats.\n3. The `book_seat` method asks the user to enter a seat number, checks if it's available, and if so, asks for the user's details and books the seat.\n4. The `cancel_booking` method asks the user to enter a seat number, checks if it's booked, and if so, cancels the booking.\n5. The `main` function creates a `TicketBooking` object and provides a menu for the user to book a seat, cancel a booking, or exit the program.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Book a seat: Enter `1` at the menu, then enter a seat number (e.g., `A1`), and provide your details.\n* Cancel a booking: Enter `2` at the menu, then enter a seat number (e.g., `A1`).\n* Exit the program: Enter `3` at the menu.",
