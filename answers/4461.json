  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Numbers in a List using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that calculates the sum of numbers in a list using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    for num in num_list:\n        total_sum += num\n    return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = calculate_sum(numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of numbers in the list is:\", result)\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_sum` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of numbers in the list.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list.\n4. Inside the loop, add each number to `total_sum`.\n5. After the loop finishes, return the `total_sum`.\n6. In the example usage, create a list of numbers and pass it to the `calculate_sum` function.\n7. Print the result, which is the sum of numbers in the list.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nThe sum of numbers in the list is: 15\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple way to calculate the sum of numbers in a list using a for loop. You can modify the `numbers` list to test the program with different inputs.",
