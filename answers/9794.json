  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an object as input and processes it, then outputs the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes an object as input, processes it, and outputs the result.\n\n```python\ndef process_object(obj):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an object as input, processes it, and returns the result.\n    \n    The processing step in this example is simply to print the type and value of the object.\n    In a real-world application, you would replace this with your actual processing logic.\n    \n    Args:\n        obj: The object to be processed.\n    \n    Returns:\n        The processed object.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Object type: {type(obj)}\")\n    print(f\"Object value: {obj}\")\n    return obj\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function with different types of objects\n    objects = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True, None, [1, 2, 3], {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}]\n    \n    for obj in objects:\n        print(f\"Processing object: {obj}\")\n        result = process_object(obj)\n        print(f\"Result: {result}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `process_object` function takes an object as input, prints its type and value, and returns the object. The `main` function tests `process_object` with different types of objects, including integers, strings, floats, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.\n\nYou can replace the `process_object` function with your own processing logic to suit your needs. This program serves as a basic template for taking an object as input, processing it, and outputting the result.",
