  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the frequency of each element in the array. The program should output a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the array and the values are their respective frequencies.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\ndef get_frequency_of_elements(arr: List[int]) -> Dict[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array of integers as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the array.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dict[int, int]: A dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the array and the values are their respective frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency = {}\n    for element in arr:\n        if element not in frequency:\n            frequency[element] = 1\n        else:\n            frequency[element] += 1\n    return frequency\n```\nI've written the code exactly as specified, including the docstring, type hints, and the loop that populates the `frequency` dictionary. The function takes an array of integers as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the array.",
