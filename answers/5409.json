  "prompt": "Create a function named 'find_index' that finds and returns the index of a specific element in a given list.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that finds and returns the index of a specific element in a given list, addressing your question with a step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and returns the index of a specific element in a given list.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    lst (list): The list to search for the element.\n    element: The element to find in the list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input is a list, raise TypeError if not\n    if not isinstance(lst, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n    \n    # Try to find the index of the element in the list\n    try:\n        # Use the index method of the list to find the index of the element\n        # This method raises a ValueError if the element is not found\n        index = lst.index(element)\n        \n        # If the element is found, return its index\n        return index\n    \n    # If the element is not found, catch the ValueError and return -1\n    except ValueError:\n        # Return -1 to indicate that the element was not found\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(my_list, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(my_list, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_index` takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to search) and `element` (the item to find). It first checks if `lst` is indeed a list, raising a `TypeError` if not.\n* It attempts to find the index of `element` in `lst` using the `index` method, which raises a `ValueError` if `element` is not found.\n* If `element` is found, its index is returned; otherwise, the function catches the `ValueError` and returns -1 to indicate that `element` is not in `lst`.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use `find_index` with a list `my_list` and elements 3 and 6, showcasing both a successful find and a case where the element is not in the list.",
