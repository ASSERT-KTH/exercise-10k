  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the longest common prefix of an array of strings. It iterates over the characters in the first string and checks if they match the corresponding characters in the other strings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix of an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    print(longest_common_prefix([\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\n    print(longest_common_prefix([\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]))  # Output: \"\"\n    print(longest_common_prefix([\"a\"]))  # Output: \"a\"\n    print(longest_common_prefix([\"\"]))  # Output: \"\"\n    print(longest_common_prefix([]))  # Output: \"\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2.  Find the shortest string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3.  Iterate over the characters in the shortest string.\n4.  For each character, check if it matches the corresponding character in the other strings. If it doesn't, return the prefix up to the current character.\n5.  If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return the entire shortest string. This means that all strings have the same prefix, which is the shortest string itself.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string. This is because we iterate over each character in the shortest string and check it against each of the other strings.",
