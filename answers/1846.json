  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers and a predicate function as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate function returns True.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef filter_list(value, predicate):\n    if not isinstance(predicate, type(lambda: None)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Predicate must be a function\")\n\n    if not isinstance(value, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Value must be a list\")\n\n    return list(filter(predicate, value))\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification to ensure that the code matches the requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
