  "prompt": "Create a program that prints a pattern of numbers using a nested loop structure. The pattern should have 5 rows, and each row should have a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 up to the row number. For example, the first row should have the number 1, the second row should have the numbers 1 and 2, and so on. The outer loop should control the row number, and the inner loop should print the sequence of numbers for each row.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specifications:\n```\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(1, i + 1):\n        print(j, end=\" \")\n    print()\n```\nThis code will print the following pattern:\n```\n1 \n1 2 \n1 2 3 \n1 2 3 4 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n```",
