  "answer": "**Email Validation Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program checks whether an email address is valid by using a regular expression to match the email address against a set of predefined rules.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an email address.\n\n    Args:\n        email (str): The email address to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the email address is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Regular expression to match most common email address formats\n    email_regex = r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"\n    return bool(re.match(email_regex, email))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    email = input(\"Enter an email address: \")\n    if validate_email(email):\n        print(\"Email address is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Email address is not valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe `validate_email` function uses a regular expression to match the email address against a set of predefined rules. The regular expression used in this program matches most common email address formats, including:\n\n*   One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens before the `@` symbol\n*   The `@` symbol\n*   One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens after the `@` symbol\n*   A dot before the top-level domain\n*   A top-level domain with two or more characters\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `validate_email` function by prompting the user to enter an email address and then printing whether the email address is valid or not.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Valid email addresses:\n    *   `example@example.com`\n    *   `example@example.co.uk`\n    *   `example123@example.com`\n*   Invalid email addresses:\n    *   `example`\n    *   `@example.com`\n    *   `example@example`\n\nNote: This program does not check whether the email address actually exists or can receive emails. It only checks whether the email address follows a valid format.",
