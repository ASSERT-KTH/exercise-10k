  "answer": "**Union of Two Arrays Program**\n================================\n\nThis program takes two arrays as input and returns their union, i.e., an array containing all unique elements from both arrays.\n\n**Code (Python)**\n----------------\n\n```python\ndef union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The union of arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1 + arr2))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Union:\", union_of_arrays(arr1, arr2))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `union_of_arrays` function takes two lists `arr1` and `arr2` as input.\n2. It combines the two arrays into one using the `+` operator.\n3. It converts the combined array into a set using the `set()` function, which automatically removes duplicates.\n4. It converts the set back into a list using the `list()` function.\n5. The resulting list is returned as the union of the two input arrays.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nArray 2: [3, 4, 5, 6]\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the union array may not be the same as in the original arrays, as sets are unordered in Python. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension with an `if` condition to check for duplicates.",
