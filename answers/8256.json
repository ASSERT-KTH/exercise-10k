  "answer": "Here's a simple program in Python that simulates a menu system using if/else statements:\n\n```python\ndef display_menu():\n    print(\"\\n--- Menu ---\")\n    print(\"1. View Account Balance\")\n    print(\"2. Deposit Money\")\n    print(\"3. Withdraw Money\")\n    print(\"4. Exit\")\n\ndef view_balance(balance):\n    print(f\"\\nYour current balance is: ${balance}\")\n\ndef deposit_money(balance):\n    amount = float(input(\"\\nEnter the amount to deposit: $\"))\n    balance += amount\n    print(f\"\\nDeposited ${amount}. Your new balance is: ${balance}\")\n    return balance\n\ndef withdraw_money(balance):\n    amount = float(input(\"\\nEnter the amount to withdraw: $\"))\n    if amount > balance:\n        print(\"\\nInsufficient funds.\")\n    else:\n        balance -= amount\n        print(f\"\\nWithdrew ${amount}. Your new balance is: ${balance}\")\n    return balance\n\ndef main():\n    balance = 1000.0\n    while True:\n        display_menu()\n        choice = input(\"\\nEnter your choice (1-4): \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            view_balance(balance)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            balance = deposit_money(balance)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            balance = withdraw_money(balance)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"\\nExiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nInvalid choice. Please choose again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program simulates a simple banking system with the following features:\n*   It displays a menu to the user with four options: view account balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program.\n*   The `view_balance` function displays the user's current account balance.\n*   The `deposit_money` function prompts the user to enter an amount to deposit and updates the balance accordingly.\n*   The `withdraw_money` function prompts the user to enter an amount to withdraw and updates the balance if there are sufficient funds.\n*   The `main` function runs the program in a loop until the user chooses to exit.\n\nThe program uses if/else statements to handle the user's choices and perform the corresponding actions.",
