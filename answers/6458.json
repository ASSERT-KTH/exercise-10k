  "answer": "**Trapezoid Area Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the area of a trapezoid given the lengths of its two parallel sides and its height.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a trapezoid.\n\n    Args:\n        base1 (float): Length of the first parallel side.\n        base2 (float): Length of the second parallel side.\n        height (float): Height of the trapezoid.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Area of the trapezoid.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base1 <= 0 or base2 <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"All input values must be positive.\")\n\n    area = 0.5 * (base1 + base2) * height\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    base1 = 5  # length of the first parallel side\n    base2 = 10  # length of the second parallel side\n    height = 6  # height of the trapezoid\n\n    area = calculate_trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height)\n    print(f\"The area of the trapezoid is: {area:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_trapezoid_area` function takes three arguments: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`.\n2. It checks if all input values are positive. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The area of the trapezoid is calculated using the formula: `0.5 * (base1 + base2) * height`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_trapezoid_area` function with example values.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Replace the example values in the `main` function with your own values for `base1`, `base2`, and `height`.\n3. The program will calculate and print the area of the trapezoid.\n\nNote: This program uses the formula for the area of a trapezoid: `A = 0.5 * (a + b) * h`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides, and `h` is the height.",
