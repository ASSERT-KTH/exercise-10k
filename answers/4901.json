  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given number is greater than 10. If it is, print 'The number is greater than 10'. Otherwise, print 'The number is less than or equal to 10'.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if a given number is greater than 10:\n\n```python\ndef check_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is greater than 10.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if num > 10:\n        print('The number is greater than 10')\n    else:\n        print('The number is less than or equal to 10')\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncheck_number(num)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. The program defines a function `check_number` that takes one argument `num`.\n2. Inside the function, it checks if `num` is greater than 10 using an `if` statement.\n3. If `num` is greater than 10, it prints `'The number is greater than 10'`.\n4. If `num` is not greater than 10, it prints `'The number is less than or equal to 10'`.\n5. In the example usage, the program asks the user to enter a number, converts it to an integer, and then calls `check_number` with the entered number.",
