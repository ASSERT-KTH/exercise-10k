  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program uses a sliding window approach with a set data structure to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the longest substring\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize variables for the sliding window\n    left = 0\n    char_set = set()\n\n    # Iterate over the string\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        # While the character at the right pointer is in the set, remove the character at the left pointer from the set and move the left pointer to the right\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n\n        # Add the character at the right pointer to the set\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n\n        # Update the maximum length and substring if the current substring is longer\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"abcabcbb\"\n    result = longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(input_string)\n    print(f\"Longest substring without repeating characters: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize variables to keep track of the longest substring and the sliding window.\n2. Iterate over the string using the right pointer.\n3. When a repeating character is found, remove characters from the left pointer until the repeating character is removed from the set.\n4. Update the maximum length and substring if the current substring is longer.\n5. Return the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the set used to store unique characters.",
