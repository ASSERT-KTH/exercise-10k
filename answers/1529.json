The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n2.  **Implementation Details**:\n\n    *   The outer loop (`for i in range(n - 1)`) iterates through the array `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array.\n    *   The inner loop (`for j in range(n - i - 1)`) compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n    *   A flag `swapped` is used to track if any swaps were made in the inner loop. If no swaps were made, it means the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.\n3.  **Time and Space Complexity**:\n\n    *   **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of items being sorted. However, with the optimization of terminating early if no swaps are made, the best-case time complexity is O(n) when the input is already sorted.\n    *   **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because Bubble Sort only uses a constant amount of additional memory for variables like `swapped` and loop counters.",
