  "answer": "**Filtering a List Based on a Condition**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that filters a given list based on a given condition.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef filter_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a given list based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The filtered list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [item for item in input_list if condition(item)]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Filter even numbers\neven_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n\n# Filter odd numbers\nodd_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 != 0)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n\n# Filter numbers greater than 5\ngreater_than_five = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)\nprint(\"Numbers greater than 5:\", greater_than_five)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `filter_list` function takes an input list and a condition as arguments.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the items from the input list for which the condition function returns `True`.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to filter a list of numbers to get even numbers, odd numbers, and numbers greater than 5.\n*   The condition is specified using a lambda function, which is a shorthand way to define a small anonymous function.\n\n### Output\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nOdd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nNumbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```",
