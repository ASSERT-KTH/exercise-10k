  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Game**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between two players. The game is played using if/else statements to determine the winner.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if player_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\") or \\\n         (player_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n    player_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while player_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        player_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {player_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\")\n\n    result = determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.\n4. The result will be printed to the console.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n2. The `determine_winner` function uses if/else statements to determine the winner based on the player's choice and the computer's choice.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for their choice, gets the computer's choice, and determines the winner using the `determine_winner` function.\n4. The result is printed to the console.",
