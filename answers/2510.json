  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal).\n        time (float): The time the money is invested for (in years).\n        n (int, optional): The number of times the interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * ((1 + rate/n) ** (n*time)) - principal\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time (in years): \"))\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of times the interest is compounded per year (default=1): \") or 1)\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The compound interest is: {interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes four arguments: `principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `n`. The `n` argument is optional and defaults to 1 if not provided.\n2. The function returns the compound interest using the formula: `A = P * (1 + r/n) ^ (n*t)`, where `A` is the amount of money accumulated after `t` years, including interest, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the annual interest rate (in decimal), `n` is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and `t` is the time the money is invested for (in years).\n3. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the principal amount, interest rate, time, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year.\n4. The `calculate_compound_interest` function is called with the user input, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter the following values:\n\t+ Principal amount: 1000\n\t+ Interest rate: 5\n\t+ Time: 2\n\t+ Number of times the interest is compounded per year: 2\n* The program will output the compound interest: `The compound interest is: 51.01`",
