  "answer": "**Getting User Input and Printing a Greeting Message**\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their name.\"\"\"\n    return input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message with the provided name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(user_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The `get_user_name` function uses the built-in `input` function to prompt the user for their name and returns the input as a string.\n2. The `print_greeting` function takes a name as an argument and prints out a greeting message using an f-string to insert the name into the message.\n3. The `main` function coordinates the process by first getting the user's name and then printing out the greeting message.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this script, it will prompt you to enter your name. After entering your name, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John!\n```",
