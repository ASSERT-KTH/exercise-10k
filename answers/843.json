  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two. This response will guide you through the implementation of the composite function. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.\ndef compose_functions(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.\n    \n    The composition of two functions f and g is defined as (f \u2218 g)(x) = f(g(x)). In other words, the output of the second function is passed as the input to the first function.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function in the composition.\n        func2 (function): The second function in the composition.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a new function that will be the composition of func1 and func2.\n    def composite_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # First, call func2 with the given arguments and keyword arguments.\n        result_from_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Then, call func1 with the result from func2 as its argument.\n        result_from_func1 = func1(result_from_func2)\n        \n        # Return the result from func1.\n        return result_from_func1\n    \n    # Return the composite function.\n    return composite_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Create a new function that is the composition of add_one and square.\ncomposed = compose_functions(add_one, square)\n\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 26\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function is defined to take two functions `func1` and `func2` as arguments and returns a new function `composite_function`.\n* Within `composite_function`, `func2` is called with the given arguments `*args` and `**kwargs`, and its result is passed as an argument to `func1`.\n* The result from `func1` is then returned by `composite_function`, effectively creating the composition of `func1` and `func2`.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to create a new function `composed` that is the composition of `add_one` and `square`, and then calls `composed` with the argument `5` to produce the output `26`.",
