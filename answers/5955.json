  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a voting system. The program should ask for the candidates, the votes, and then print out the winner.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that simulates a voting system:\n\n```python\ndef voting_system():\n    # Get the candidates\n    candidates = input(\"Enter the candidates separated by commas: \")\n    candidates = [candidate.strip() for candidate in candidates.split(\",\")]\n\n    # Initialize the votes dictionary\n    votes = {candidate: 0 for candidate in candidates}\n\n    # Get the votes\n    num_voters = int(input(\"Enter the number of voters: \"))\n    for i in range(num_voters):\n        print(f\"Voter {i+1}'s turn:\")\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            print(f\"{candidates.index(candidate)+1}. {candidate}\")\n        choice = int(input(\"Enter the number of your chosen candidate: \")) - 1\n        if 0 <= choice < len(candidates):\n            votes[candidates[choice]] += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Your vote will not be counted.\")\n\n    # Print out the results\n    print(\"\\nResults:\")\n    for candidate, vote in votes.items():\n        print(f\"{candidate}: {vote} votes\")\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    max_votes = max(votes.values())\n    winners = [candidate for candidate, vote in votes.items() if vote == max_votes]\n\n    if len(winners) == 1:\n        print(f\"\\nThe winner is {winners[0]} with {max_votes} votes!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nIt's a tie between {', '.join(winners)} with {max_votes} votes each.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    voting_system()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1. **Get Candidates**: The program asks for the candidates separated by commas.\n2. **Get Votes**: It then asks for the number of voters and each voter's choice.\n3. **Tally Votes**: The program tallies the votes for each candidate.\n4. **Print Results**: It prints out the number of votes for each candidate.\n5. **Determine Winner**: Finally, it determines the winner(s) and prints out the result.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n```\nEnter the candidates separated by commas: John, Mary, David\nEnter the number of voters: 5\nVoter 1's turn:\n1. John\n2. Mary\n3. David\nEnter the number of your chosen candidate: 1\nVoter 2's turn:\n1. John\n2. Mary\n3. David\nEnter the number of your chosen candidate: 2\nVoter 3's turn:\n1. John\n2. Mary\n3. David\nEnter the number of your chosen candidate: 1\nVoter 4's turn:\n1. John\n2. Mary\n3. David\nEnter the number of your chosen candidate: 3\nVoter 5's turn:\n1. John\n2. Mary\n3. David\nEnter the number of your chosen candidate: 1\n\nResults:\nJohn: 3 votes\nMary: 1 votes\nDavid: 1 votes\n\nThe winner is John with 3 votes!\n```",
