  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The program should allow users to add students, update grades, and calculate the average grade of all students.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n```python\n# Student Grades Program\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades\nstudent_grades = {}\n\ndef add_student():\n    \"\"\"Add a new student to the dictionary\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n    grade = float(input(\"Enter student grade: \"))\n    student_grades[name] = grade\n    print(f\"Student '{name}' added with grade {grade}\")\n\ndef update_grade():\n    \"\"\"Update the grade of an existing student\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n    if name in student_grades:\n        new_grade = float(input(\"Enter new grade: \"))\n        student_grades[name] = new_grade\n        print(f\"Grade of '{name}' updated to {new_grade}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' not found\")\n\ndef calculate_average():\n    \"\"\"Calculate the average grade of all students\"\"\"\n    if not student_grades:\n        print(\"No students in the dictionary\")\n        return\n    average_grade = sum(student_grades.values()) / len(student_grades)\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nStudent Grades Program\")\n        print(\"1. Add student\")\n        print(\"2. Update grade\")\n        print(\"3. Calculate average grade\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            add_student()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            update_grade()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            calculate_average()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis program uses a dictionary to store student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The `add_student` function adds a new student to the dictionary, the `update_grade` function updates the grade of an existing student, and the `calculate_average` function calculates the average grade of all students. The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Add a student: Enter `1` at the main menu, enter the student's name and grade, and the student will be added to the dictionary.\n* Update a grade: Enter `2` at the main menu, enter the student's name, and enter the new grade. If the student exists, their grade will be updated.\n* Calculate average grade: Enter `3` at the main menu, and the program will calculate and display the average grade of all students in the dictionary.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not persist data between runs. If you want to store the data in a file or database, you would need to modify the program accordingly.",
