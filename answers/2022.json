  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their score using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate and print the student's grade\n        grade = calculate_grade(score)\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, validates it, and then calls the `calculate_grade` function to calculate the grade.\n3. The grade is then printed to the console.\n\n### Grade Scale\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n* Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n* Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n* Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n* Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.",
