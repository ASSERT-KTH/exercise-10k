  "prompt": "Write a program to perform logical operations using variables, such as AND, OR, and NOT.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program to perform logical operations:\n\n```python\n# Define two boolean variables\na = True\nb = False\n\n# AND operation\nprint(\"AND operation:\")\nprint(\"a =\", a)\nprint(\"b =\", b)\nprint(\"a and b =\", a and b)\n\n# OR operation\nprint(\"\\nOR operation:\")\nprint(\"a =\", a)\nprint(\"b =\", b)\nprint(\"a or b =\", a or b)\n\n# NOT operation\nprint(\"\\nNOT operation:\")\nprint(\"a =\", a)\nprint(\"not a =\", not a)\nprint(\"b =\", b)\nprint(\"not b =\", not b)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nAND operation:\na = True\nb = False\na and b = False\n\nOR operation:\na = True\nb = False\na or b = True\n\nNOT operation:\na = True\nnot a = False\nb = False\nnot b = True\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates the usage of logical operators in Python. Here's a brief explanation:\n\n- `and` operator: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.\n- `or` operator: Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`, otherwise returns `False`.\n- `not` operator: Returns the opposite of the operand. If the operand is `True`, it returns `False`, and if the operand is `False`, it returns `True`.\n\nYou can modify the values of `a` and `b` to see how the logical operations work with different inputs.",
