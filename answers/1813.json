  "answer": "**Bank Account Transaction Manager**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program manages bank account transactions, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a bank account with account number, account name, and initial balance.\n        \n        Args:\n            account_number (str): Unique account number.\n            account_name (str): Account holder's name.\n            balance (float, optional): Initial account balance. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_name = account_name\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit money into the account.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f} into account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw money from the account.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f} from account {self.account_number}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds for withdrawal.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Display the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Account {self.account_number} balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account_number = input(\"Enter account number: \")\n    account_name = input(\"Enter account name: \")\n    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_name)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Transaction Manager\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose a transaction type: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid transaction type.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Deposit**:\n\t* Enter account number: `12345`\n\t* Enter account name: `John Doe`\n\t* Choose a transaction type: `1`\n\t* Enter deposit amount: `100`\n\t* Output: `Deposited $100.00 into account 12345. New balance: $100.00`\n2. **Withdrawal**:\n\t* Enter account number: `12345`\n\t* Enter account name: `John Doe`\n\t* Choose a transaction type: `2`\n\t* Enter withdrawal amount: `50`\n\t* Output: `Withdrew $50.00 from account 12345. New balance: $50.00`\n3. **Check Balance**:\n\t* Enter account number: `12345`\n\t* Enter account name: `John Doe`\n\t* Choose a transaction type: `3`\n\t* Output: `Account 12345 balance: $50.00`\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage account transactions.\n* The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods use conditional statements to validate the transaction amounts and update the account balance accordingly.\n* The `check_balance` method simply displays the current account balance.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program.",
