  "answer": "**Substring Extraction Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program will ask the user for a string and then extract a substring based on the user's input.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef extract_substring():\n    # Get the original string from the user\n    original_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n\n    # Get the start and end indices from the user\n    start_index = int(input(\"Please enter the start index of the substring: \"))\n    end_index = int(input(\"Please enter the end index of the substring: \"))\n\n    # Validate the indices\n    if start_index < 0 or end_index > len(original_string) or start_index > end_index:\n        print(\"Invalid indices. Please try again.\")\n        return extract_substring()\n\n    # Extract the substring\n    substring = original_string[start_index:end_index]\n\n    # Print the substring\n    print(\"The extracted substring is:\", substring)\n\n# Call the function\nextract_substring()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a string, the start index of the substring, and the end index of the substring. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter a string: Hello, World!\nPlease enter the start index of the substring: 7\nPlease enter the end index of the substring: 12\nThe extracted substring is: World\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses 0-based indexing, meaning the first character of the string is at index 0.\n* The program validates the indices to ensure they are within the bounds of the string and that the start index is less than or equal to the end index.\n* If the indices are invalid, the program will recursively call itself to prompt the user for new indices.",
