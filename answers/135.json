  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator**\n==========================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given integers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first integer.\n        num2 (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD of num1 and num2\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n\n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM = (num1 * num2) / GCD\n    lcm = (num1 * num2) // gcd\n\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 12\n    num2 = 15\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input.\n2. It calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `num1` and `num2` using the `math.gcd` function.\n3. The LCM is then calculated using the formula: `LCM = (num1 * num2) / GCD`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of the `calculate_lcm` function.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the GCD, which is available in Python 3.5 and later.\n* The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.\n* The program assumes that the input integers are positive. If you need to handle negative integers, you can modify the program accordingly.",
