  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and two numbers as input. Use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform and output the result. If the operation is division and the second number is zero, output an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef math_operations(operation, num1, num2):\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            result = 'Error: Division by zero is not allowed'\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = 'Error: Invalid operation'\n    return result\n\nnum1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))\nnum2 = float(input('Enter the second number: '))\noperation = input('Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): ')\n\nresult = math_operations(operation, num1, num2)\nprint('The result is:', result)\n```\nThis code defines the `math_operations` function, which takes in three arguments: `operation`, `num1`, and `num2`. It uses conditional statements (`if` and `elif`) to determine which mathematical operation to perform based on the value of `operation`.\n\nThe code then prompts the user to enter the first number, second number, and operation, and calls the `math_operations` function with these values. Finally, it prints the result of the operation.\n\nNote that I used `float` instead of `int` to convert the user's input to a number, since the problem statement doesn't specify that the numbers must be integers. If you want to restrict the input to integers only, you can change `float` to `int`.",
