  "answer": "**Binary File Reader**\n=======================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that reads a binary file and prints out its contents.\n\n```python\ndef read_binary_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a binary file and prints out its contents.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the binary file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n            # Read the file contents\n            contents = file.read()\n            \n            # Print the file contents in hexadecimal format\n            print(\"Binary File Contents (Hexadecimal):\")\n            for i, byte in enumerate(contents):\n                print(f\"{byte:02x}\", end=' ')\n                if (i + 1) % 16 == 0:\n                    print()\n            print()\n            \n            # Print the file contents in ASCII format (if possible)\n            print(\"Binary File Contents (ASCII):\")\n            try:\n                ascii_contents = contents.decode('ascii')\n                print(ascii_contents)\n            except UnicodeDecodeError:\n                print(\"The file contains non-ASCII characters and cannot be printed in ASCII format.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = \"example.bin\"  # Replace with your binary file path\n    read_binary_file(file_path)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program defines a function `read_binary_file` that takes the file path as an argument.\n2. It attempts to open the file in binary read mode (`'rb'`).\n3. It reads the file contents using the `read()` method.\n4. It prints the file contents in hexadecimal format, with each byte represented as a two-digit hexadecimal value.\n5. It attempts to print the file contents in ASCII format by decoding the bytes using the `decode('ascii')` method. If the file contains non-ASCII characters, it catches the `UnicodeDecodeError` exception and prints a message indicating that the file cannot be printed in ASCII format.\n6. In the example usage section, replace `\"example.bin\"` with the path to your binary file.\n\n**Note**: This program assumes that the binary file is in the same directory as the Python script. If the file is located elsewhere, provide the full path to the file.",
