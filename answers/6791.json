  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to iterate through an array of numbers and calculate the sum of the squares of each number. The program should then print out the sum.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specification:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        int sum = 0;\n\n        for (int number : numbers) {\n            sum += number * number;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of the squares of the numbers is: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis Java program creates an array of numbers, initializes a variable `sum` to 0, and then uses a for-each loop to iterate over the array. For each number, it calculates the square of the number and adds it to the `sum` variable. After the loop, it prints out the sum of the squares of the numbers in the array.",
