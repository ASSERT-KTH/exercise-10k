  "answer": "**Solution: Finding the First Non-Repeating Character in a String**\n===========================================================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a string, find the first non-repeating character. If no such character exists, return `None`.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string. Then, we iterate over the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store character frequencies\n    char_freq = {}\n\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_freq[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbc\"))  # Output: \"c\"\nprint(first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create a dictionary `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string to count the frequency of each character.\n3. Iterate over the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n4. If no non-repeating character is found, return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over the string twice: once to count character frequencies and once to find the first non-repeating character.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we store the frequency of each character in a dictionary, which can potentially contain n entries.",
