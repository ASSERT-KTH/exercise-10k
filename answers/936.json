  "answer": "**Simple Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple number guessing game written in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {tries} tries.\")\n            break\n        # Check if the user's guess is too high\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n        # Check if the user's guess is too low\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint` function.\n2. The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the program thanks the user and exits the loop.\n4. If the user's guess is not a valid integer, the program prints an error message and asks for another guess.\n5. If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and exits the loop.\n6. If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program prints a hint and asks for another guess.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* The user guesses the number correctly on the first try.\n* The user guesses the number incorrectly, and the program provides hints to help them guess again.\n* The user types \"quit\" to exit the game.",
