  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student passed or failed based on a conditional statement. The passing grade is 50.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int grade;\n\n    cout << \"Enter the grade: \";\n    cin >> grade;\n\n    if (grade >= 50) {\n        cout << \"The student has passed.\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"The student has failed.\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, including the preprocessor directives, variable declaration, input, conditional statement, output, and program termination. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
