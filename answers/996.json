  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height. The program uses if-else statements to determine the BMI category.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\n# Get user's weight and height\nweight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\nheight = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n# Calculate BMI\nbmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n\n# Determine BMI category\nif bmi < 18.5:\n    category = \"Underweight\"\nelif bmi < 25:\n    category = \"Normal\"\nelif bmi < 30:\n    category = \"Overweight\"\nelse:\n    category = \"Obese\"\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Your BMI category is: {category}\")\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a weight of 70 kg and a height of 1.75 meters, the program will calculate the BMI and determine the corresponding category.\n* If the user enters a weight of 50 kg and a height of 1.60 meters, the program will calculate the BMI and determine the corresponding category.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The program first asks the user to input their weight in kilograms and height in meters.\n2. It then calculates the BMI using the formula `BMI = weight / height^2`.\n3. The program uses if-else statements to determine the BMI category based on the calculated BMI value.\n4. Finally, it prints out the calculated BMI and the corresponding category.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to enter the correct units for weight (kg) and height (meters) to get an accurate BMI calculation.\n* The BMI categories are based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) definitions:\n\t+ Underweight: BMI < 18.5\n\t+ Normal: BMI = 18.5-24.9\n\t+ Overweight: BMI = 25-29.9\n\t+ Obese: BMI \u2265 30\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter valid numeric values for weight and height. You may want to add error handling to handle invalid inputs.",
