  "prompt": "Develop a program that allows two players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the players' choices as input and determine the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game:\n\n```python\ndef get_player_choice(player_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the player's choice and validate it.\n    \n    Args:\n        player_name (str): The name of the player.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The player's choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        choice = input(f\"{player_name}, enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\n        if choice.lower() in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return choice.lower()\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\n    \n    Args:\n        player1_choice (str): The choice of player 1.\n        player2_choice (str): The choice of player 2.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The name of the winner, or \"tie\" if it's a tie.\n    \"\"\"\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return \"tie\"\n    elif (player1_choice == \"rock\" and player2_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"scissors\" and player2_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"paper\" and player2_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"player1\"\n    else:\n        return \"player2\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    The main function of the program.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    \n    player1_name = input(\"Enter player 1's name: \")\n    player2_name = input(\"Enter player 2's name: \")\n    \n    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name)\n    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name)\n    \n    winner = determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice)\n    \n    if winner == \"tie\":\n        print(f\"It's a tie! Both {player1_name} and {player2_name} chose {player1_choice}.\")\n    elif winner == \"player1\":\n        print(f\"{player1_name} wins! {player1_choice} beats {player2_choice}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{player2_name} wins! {player2_choice} beats {player1_choice}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The program starts by asking for the names of the two players.\n* The `get_player_choice` function is used to get the choice of each player and validate it to make sure it's one of the allowed choices (rock, paper, or scissors).\n* The `determine_winner` function is used to determine the winner based on the game's rules. It returns the name of the winner, or \"tie\" if it's a tie.\n* The `main` function is the main function of the program. It calls the other functions and prints the result of the game.\n* The program uses a simple text-based interface to interact with the players.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Two players, Alice and Bob, want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. They run the program and enter their names. They are then prompted to enter their choices. Alice enters \"rock\" and Bob enters \"scissors\". The program determines that Alice wins and prints the result.\n* Two players, Charlie and David, want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. They run the program and enter their names. They are then prompted to enter their choices. Charlie enters \"paper\" and David enters \"paper\". The program determines that it's a tie and prints the result.",
