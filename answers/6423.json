  "prompt": "Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print 'Fizz' instead, and for multiples of 5, print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. Use a for loop.",
  "answer": "**FizzBuzz Program**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that implements the FizzBuzz logic using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz\")\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Buzz\")\n        else:\n            print(i)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage: print FizzBuzz sequence up to 100\n    fizz_buzz(100)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `fizz_buzz` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`.\n3. For each number, it checks the following conditions:\n   * If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints \"FizzBuzz\".\n   * If the number is a multiple of 3 but not 5, it prints \"Fizz\".\n   * If the number is a multiple of 5 but not 3, it prints \"Buzz\".\n   * If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `fizz_buzz` function by printing the sequence up to 100.\n\nYou can run this program to see the FizzBuzz sequence printed to the console.",
