  "prompt": "Perform basic set operations, such as union and intersection, on two sets.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses built-in set operations to find the union and intersection of two sets.\n\n### Set Operations\n#### Code\n```python\ndef set_operations(set1, set2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs basic set operations.\n\n    Args:\n        set1 (set): The first set.\n        set2 (set): The second set.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the union and intersection of the two sets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the union of the two sets\n    union = set1.union(set2)\n    \n    # Calculate the intersection of the two sets\n    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)\n\n    return union, intersection\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\n    union, intersection = set_operations(set1, set2)\n\n    print(\"Set 1:\", set1)\n    print(\"Set 2:\", set2)\n    print(\"Union:\", union)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `set_operations` function takes two sets as input and returns their union and intersection.\n2. The `union` method is used to calculate the union of the two sets.\n3. The `intersection` method is used to calculate the intersection of the two sets.\n4. In the `main` function, we create two example sets and call the `set_operations` function to demonstrate its usage.\n\n#### Output\n```\nSet 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nIntersection: {4, 5}\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution Using Operators\nPython also provides operators for set operations:\n- Union: `set1 | set2`\n- Intersection: `set1 & set2`\n- Difference: `set1 - set2`\n- Symmetric Difference: `set1 ^ set2`\n\nHere's how you can use these operators:\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nset2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nunion = set1 | set2\nintersection = set1 & set2\n\nprint(\"Union:\", union)\nprint(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n```",
