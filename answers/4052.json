  "answer": "### Printing Dictionary Keys\n\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef print_dictionary_keys(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loops through all the keys in the dictionary and prints each key.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to loop through.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for key in input_dict.keys():\n        print(key)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2, \"cherry\": 3}\n    print_dictionary_keys(example_dict)\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more Pythonic way to loop through the dictionary keys:\n\n```python\ndef print_dictionary_keys(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loops through all the keys in the dictionary and prints each key.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to loop through.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for key in input_dict:\n        print(key)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_dict = {\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2, \"cherry\": 3}\n    print_dictionary_keys(example_dict)\n```\n\nIn this version, we're taking advantage of the fact that iterating over a dictionary (`for key in input_dict`) automatically yields its keys. This approach is more concise and efficient.",
