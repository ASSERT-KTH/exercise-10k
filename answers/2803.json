  "prompt": "Write a program to ask the user for two numbers and print their sum to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n```\n# Ask the user for two numbers\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum\nsum = num1 + num2\n\n# Print the sum to the console\nprint(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", sum)\n```\nLet me explain how this program works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to ask the user for input. The string passed to `input()` is the prompt that is displayed to the user.\n2. The `float()` function is used to convert the user's input into a floating-point number. This allows the user to enter decimal numbers.\n3. The sum of the two numbers is calculated using the `+` operator.\n4. The `print()` function is used to display the sum to the console.\n\nYou can save this code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `sum_program.py`) and run it from the command line using `python sum_program.py`.\n\nExample use case:\n```\n$ python sum_program.py\nEnter the first number: 3.5\nEnter the second number: 2.8\nThe sum of the two numbers is: 6.3\n```\nNote: I used `float()` instead of `int()` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers. If you only want to allow integer inputs, you can use `int()` instead.",
