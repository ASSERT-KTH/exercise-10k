  "answer": "**Calculating the Equation of a Line**\n=====================================\n\nThe equation of a line can be calculated using the slope-intercept form, which is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere:\n\n* y is the y-coordinate of a point on the line\n* m is the slope of the line\n* x is the x-coordinate of a point on the line\n* b is the y-intercept of the line\n\n**Program**\n-----------\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the equation of a line given two points:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_line_equation(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the equation of a line given two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The first point on the line (x, y)\n        point2 (tuple): The second point on the line (x, y)\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The slope (m) and y-intercept (b) of the line\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n\n    # Calculate the slope\n    if x2 - x1 == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The line is vertical and has no slope\")\n    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\n    # Calculate the y-intercept\n    b = y1 - m * x1\n\n    return m, b\n\ndef print_line_equation(m, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the equation of a line in slope-intercept form.\n\n    Args:\n        m (float): The slope of the line\n        b (float): The y-intercept of the line\n    \"\"\"\n    if b < 0:\n        print(f\"y = {m}x - {abs(b)}\")\n    elif b > 0:\n        print(f\"y = {m}x + {b}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"y = {m}x\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (3, 4)\n    m, b = calculate_line_equation(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"Slope (m): {m}\")\n    print(f\"Y-intercept (b): {b}\")\n    print(\"Equation of the line:\")\n    print_line_equation(m, b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe program consists of three functions:\n\n1. `calculate_line_equation`: This function calculates the slope and y-intercept of a line given two points.\n2. `print_line_equation`: This function prints the equation of a line in slope-intercept form.\n3. `main`: This function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_line_equation` and `print_line_equation` functions.\n\nThe `calculate_line_equation` function uses the formula for the slope of a line:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nand then calculates the y-intercept using the formula:\n\nb = y1 - m * x1\n\nThe `print_line_equation` function prints the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.\n\nIn the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the program by calculating the equation of a line given two points (1, 2) and (3, 4). The program then prints the slope, y-intercept, and equation of the line.",
