  "answer": "**Car Rental Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program allows users to rent a car based on their age and driving experience.\n\n**Code**\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store car rental information\ncar_rental_info = {\n    \"Economy\": {\"age_limit\": 21, \"experience_limit\": 1, \"rental_fee\": 40},\n    \"Compact\": {\"age_limit\": 25, \"experience_limit\": 2, \"rental_fee\": 50},\n    \"Midsize\": {\"age_limit\": 28, \"experience_limit\": 3, \"rental_fee\": 60},\n    \"Fullsize\": {\"age_limit\": 30, \"experience_limit\": 5, \"rental_fee\": 80},\n}\n\ndef rent_car(car_type, age, experience):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rent a car based on the user's age and driving experience.\n\n    Args:\n        car_type (str): The type of car to rent.\n        age (int): The user's age.\n        experience (int): The user's driving experience in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating whether the car can be rented or not.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the car type is valid\n    if car_type not in car_rental_info:\n        return \"Invalid car type. Please choose from: Economy, Compact, Midsize, Fullsize\"\n\n    # Check if the user meets the age requirement\n    if age < car_rental_info[car_type][\"age_limit\"]:\n        return f\"You must be at least {car_rental_info[car_type]['age_limit']} years old to rent a {car_type} car.\"\n\n    # Check if the user meets the driving experience requirement\n    if experience < car_rental_info[car_type][\"experience_limit\"]:\n        return f\"You must have at least {car_rental_info[car_type]['experience_limit']} years of driving experience to rent a {car_type} car.\"\n\n    # If all requirements are met, rent the car\n    return f\"Congratulations! You can rent a {car_type} car for ${car_rental_info[car_type]['rental_fee']} per day.\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to our car rental service!\")\n    car_type = input(\"Which type of car would you like to rent? (Economy, Compact, Midsize, Fullsize): \")\n    age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n    experience = int(input(\"How many years of driving experience do you have? \"))\n\n    result = rent_car(car_type, age, experience)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Renting an Economy car:\n\t* Input: `Economy`, `25`, `2`\n\t* Output: `Congratulations! You can rent an Economy car for $40 per day.`\n2. Renting a Compact car with insufficient age:\n\t* Input: `Compact`, `20`, `2`\n\t* Output: `You must be at least 25 years old to rent a Compact car.`\n3. Renting a Midsize car with insufficient driving experience:\n\t* Input: `Midsize`, `30`, `2`\n\t* Output: `You must have at least 3 years of driving experience to rent a Midsize car.`\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store car rental information and performs basic validation checks using if/else statements. In a real-world application, you would likely want to use a more robust data storage solution and implement additional validation and error handling mechanisms.",
