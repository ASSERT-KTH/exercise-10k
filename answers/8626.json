  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the longest substring without repeating characters. It uses a sliding window approach with the help of a set to keep track of unique characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_set = set()\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"abcabcbb\"\n    result = longest_substring(input_string)\n    print(f\"Input String: {input_string}\")\n    print(f\"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `longest_substring` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.\n*   It uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the string.\n*   A set `char_set` is used to keep track of unique characters within the current window.\n*   When a repeating character is found, the `left` pointer is moved to the right until the repeating character is removed from the window.\n*   The maximum length of the substring without repeating characters is updated whenever a longer substring is found.\n*   The function returns the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).",
