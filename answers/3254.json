  "answer": "**Newton's Method for Square Root Calculation**\n====================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nNewton's method is a numerical technique used to find the roots of a function. In this case, we will use it to find the square root of a given number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef newton_sqrt(n, precision=0.00001):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the square root of a number using Newton's method.\n\n    Args:\n        n (float): The number to find the square root of.\n        precision (float): The desired precision of the result. Defaults to 0.00001.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The approximate square root of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate square root of negative number\")\n\n    # Initial guess\n    x = n / 2\n\n    while True:\n        # Newton's method formula: x_new = (x + n / x) / 2\n        x_new = (x + n / x) / 2\n\n        # Check if the difference between the current and new estimates is within the desired precision\n        if abs(x - x_new) < precision:\n            return x_new\n\n        # Update the estimate\n        x = x_new\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 9\n    sqrt = newton_sqrt(num)\n    print(f\"The square root of {num} is approximately {sqrt}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `newton_sqrt` function takes two arguments: `n`, the number to find the square root of, and `precision`, the desired precision of the result.\n2.  It first checks if the input number is negative and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n3.  The function then makes an initial guess for the square root, which is `n / 2`.\n4.  The main loop of the function applies Newton's method to iteratively improve the estimate of the square root.\n5.  The loop continues until the difference between the current estimate and the new estimate is within the desired precision.\n6.  Finally, the function returns the approximate square root of the given number.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can adjust the `precision` parameter to trade off between accuracy and computation time.\n*   Newton's method is a powerful technique for finding roots, but it may not always converge for certain functions or initial guesses. Be sure to test your implementation thoroughly.\n*   This implementation assumes that the input number is non-negative. If you need to handle complex numbers, you will need to modify the function accordingly.",
