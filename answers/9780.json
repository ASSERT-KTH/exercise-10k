  "answer": "**File Input Processor**\n========================\n\nThis program reads input from a file, processes it line by line, and performs basic operations such as counting the number of lines, words, and characters.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef process_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads input from a file and processes it.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to process.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n            lines = file.readlines()\n            line_count = len(lines)\n            word_count = sum(len(line.split()) for line in lines)\n            char_count = sum(len(line) for line in lines)\n            return line_count, word_count, char_count\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    filename = input(\"Enter the filename: \")\n    result = process_file(filename)\n    if result:\n        line_count, word_count, char_count = result\n        print(f\"Lines: {line_count}\")\n        print(f\"Words: {word_count}\")\n        print(f\"Characters: {char_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `process_file` function takes a filename as input and returns a tuple containing the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.\n2. The function uses a `with` statement to open the file in read mode, ensuring it is properly closed after use.\n3. The file is read line by line using the `readlines` method, and the number of lines is calculated using the `len` function.\n4. The number of words is calculated by splitting each line into words using the `split` method and summing the results.\n5. The number of characters is calculated by summing the lengths of each line.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a filename, calls the `process_file` function, and prints the results if the file is found.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `file_processor.py`.\n2. Create a text file named `example.txt` with some content.\n3. Run the program using `python file_processor.py`.\n4. Enter the filename `example.txt` when prompted.\n5. The program will print the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.",
