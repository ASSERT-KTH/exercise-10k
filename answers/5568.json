  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the average of the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the list of numbers from the user\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n\n    # Convert the input to a list of floats\n    try:\n        numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split()]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate and print the average\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(\"The average is:\", average)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n*   The `main` function gets a list of numbers from the user, converts the input to a list of floats, calculates the average using the `calculate_average` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program includes error handling to ensure that the input is valid and that the list is not empty.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: `1 2 3 4 5`\n    The average is: `3.0`\n*   Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: `10 20 30`\n    The average is: `20.0`\n*   Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: `a b c` (invalid input)\n    Invalid input. Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.\n*   Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: (empty input)\n    Cannot calculate average of an empty list",
