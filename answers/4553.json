  "answer": "**Longest Word Finder Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the longest word found in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_longest_word(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest word in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to search for the longest word.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest word found in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Initialize the longest word and its length\n    longest_word = \"\"\n    max_length = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation from the word\n        word = word.strip(\".,!?:;\")\n\n        # Check if the current word is longer than the longest word found so far\n        if len(word) > max_length:\n            # Update the longest word and its length\n            longest_word = word\n            max_length = len(word)\n\n    # Return the longest word\n    return longest_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"This is a sample string with multiple words\"\n    longest_word = find_longest_word(input_string)\n    print(f\"The longest word is: {longest_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_longest_word` function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the `split` method.\n2. It initializes the longest word and its length to empty string and 0, respectively.\n3. It iterates over each word in the list of words, removing any punctuation from the word using the `strip` method.\n4. If the current word is longer than the longest word found so far, it updates the longest word and its length.\n5. Finally, it returns the longest word found in the input string.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Input: \"This is a sample string with multiple words\"\n* Output: \"multiple\" (or \"string\", as they are tied for the longest word)\n\nNote: This program considers words with the same length as equally long. If you want to return all longest words in case of a tie, you can modify the program to store all longest words in a list and return the list.",
