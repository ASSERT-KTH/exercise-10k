  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns its circumference.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The circumference of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\n    return circumference\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n        print(f\"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program will first ask the user to input the radius of the circle. It will then calculate the circumference using the formula `2 * \u03c0 * radius`, and print out the result. If the user enters a negative radius, it will raise a `ValueError` with the message \"Radius cannot be negative\".\n\nThe `calculate_circumference` function is a separate function to make the code more modular and reusable. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it handles the user input and output.\n\nNote that the `math.pi` constant is used to represent the mathematical constant pi. The `float` function is used to convert the user input into a floating-point number, which allows for decimal numbers. The `try-except` block is used to catch and handle any `ValueError` that may be raised.",
