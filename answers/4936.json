  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length. The program should use the formula surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2 to calculate the surface area.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specification describes:\n```\ndef calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    # This function calculates the surface area of a cube\n    # input\n    # side_length - a positive float or int\n    # output\n    # returns a positive float or int representing the surface area of the cube\n    # description\n    # calculates the surface area of the cube using the formula surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2\n\n    surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2\n    return surface_area\n\nside_length = 5\narea = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)\nprint(\"Surface Area of the Cube is: \", area)\n```\nThis code defines a function `calculate_cube_surface_area` that takes a `side_length` as input and returns the surface area of a cube with that side length. The function uses the formula `surface_area = 6 * side_length ** 2` to calculate the surface area. The code then sets the `side_length` to 5, calls the function with that value, and stores the result in the `area` variable. Finally, it prints the result to the console.",
