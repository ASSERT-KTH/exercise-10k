  "answer": "### Checking Symmetry in a Binary Tree\n#### Overview\n\nA binary tree is symmetric if it is the same when its left subtree is mirrored with its right subtree. To check for symmetry, we can compare the left subtree with the mirrored version of the right subtree.\n\n#### Solution\n\nHere's an example of a function in Python that checks if a given binary tree is symmetric.\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in the binary tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef is_symmetric(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given binary tree is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n    root (Node): The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the binary tree is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return True\n\n    def is_mirror(node1, node2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if two trees are mirror images of each other.\n\n        Args:\n        node1 (Node): The root node of the first tree.\n        node2 (Node): The root node of the second tree.\n\n        Returns:\n        bool: True if the two trees are mirror images, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        if node1 is None and node2 is None:\n            return True\n        if node1 is None or node2 is None:\n            return False\n        return (node1.value == node2.value and\n                is_mirror(node1.left, node2.right) and\n                is_mirror(node1.right, node2.left))\n\n    return is_mirror(root.left, root.right)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a symmetric binary tree\n    #       1\n    #      / \\\n    #     2   2\n    #    / \\ / \\\n    #   3  4 4  3\n    root1 = Node(1)\n    root1.left = Node(2)\n    root1.right = Node(2)\n    root1.left.left = Node(3)\n    root1.left.right = Node(4)\n    root1.right.left = Node(4)\n    root1.right.right = Node(3)\n\n    print(is_symmetric(root1))  # Output: True\n\n    # Create an asymmetric binary tree\n    #       1\n    #      / \\\n    #     2   2\n    #    / \\\n    #   3  4\n    root2 = Node(1)\n    root2.left = Node(2)\n    root2.right = Node(2)\n    root2.left.left = Node(3)\n    root2.left.right = Node(4)\n\n    print(is_symmetric(root2))  # Output: False\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  Define a `Node` class to represent a node in the binary tree, containing a `value`, `left` child, and `right` child.\n2.  Implement the `is_symmetric` function, which takes the `root` node of the binary tree as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the tree is symmetric.\n3.  Within `is_symmetric`, define a helper function `is_mirror` to check if two trees are mirror images of each other.\n4.  In `is_mirror`, compare the values of the nodes and recursively check the left subtree of the first tree with the right subtree of the second tree, and vice versa.\n5.  If both trees are `None`, they are considered mirror images, and if only one of them is `None`, they are not mirror images.\n6.  In the `is_symmetric` function, call `is_mirror` with the left and right subtrees of the root node to check for symmetry.\n7.  Provide example usage by creating symmetric and asymmetric binary trees and demonstrating the `is_symmetric` function.",
