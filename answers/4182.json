  "answer": "### Random Number Guessing Game\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function generates a random number between 1 and 100, then repeatedly asks the user for a guess until they correctly guess the number.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random number between 1 and 100, then repeatedly asks the user for a guess until they correctly guess the number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}. Thanks for playing!\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n#### How to Use\n\n1. Run the function by calling `number_guessing_game()`.\n2. The function will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess the number.\n3. The user can enter their guess, and the function will provide feedback (e.g., \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\").\n4. The user can continue guessing until they correctly guess the number.\n5. Once the user correctly guesses the number, the function will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.\n\nNote: The user can type \"quit\" to exit the game at any time.",
