  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to declare a variable, assign it a value, and then print out the value in a specific format.\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable and assign it a value\nvariable_name = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Print out the value in a specific format\nprint(f\"The value of the variable is: {variable_name}\")\n\n# Alternatively, you can use string formatting\nprint(\"The value of the variable is: {}\".format(variable_name))\n\n# Or use the % operator\nprint(\"The value of the variable is: %s\" % variable_name)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by declaring a variable named `variable_name` and assigning it the string value `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n*   We then use the `print` function with an f-string to print out the value of the variable in a specific format. The `f` before the string denotes an f-string, which allows us to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.\n*   The `format` method and the `%` operator are also used to achieve the same result, providing alternative ways to format the output string.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   This code can be used in a variety of situations, such as logging variable values for debugging purposes or displaying user-friendly messages in a program.\n*   By modifying the format string, you can customize the output to suit your specific needs.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nTo run this code, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `variable_declaration.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python variable_declaration.py`). The output will be:\n\n```\nThe value of the variable is: Hello, World!\nThe value of the variable is: Hello, World!\nThe value of the variable is: Hello, World!\n```",
