  "answer": "Here's a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n\n### Fibonacci Sequence Function\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 10  # Change this to generate a different number of terms\n    result = fibonacci(num)\n    print(f\"The first {num} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: {result}\")\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1.  **Base Cases**: The function first checks for base cases:\n    *   If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list.\n    *   If `n` is 1 or 2, it returns the list `[0]` or `[0, 1]`, respectively.\n2.  **Initialize the Sequence**: For `n` greater than 2, it initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms `[0, 1]`.\n3.  **Generate the Sequence**: It then enters a loop, continuing until the sequence has `n` terms. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two terms to the sequence.\n4.  **Return the Sequence**: Finally, it returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\nYou can adjust the value of `num` in the example usage to generate a different number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.",
