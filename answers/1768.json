  "answer": "### Finding the Missing Number in an Array of Consecutive Integers\n\nHere's a Python function that uses the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of consecutive integers with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums) + 1  # The total number of elements in the sequence\n    start = min(nums)  # The starting number of the sequence\n    end = max(nums)  # The ending number of the sequence\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the complete sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n    total_sum = (n * (start + end)) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the given sequence\n    given_sum = sum(nums)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the given sum\n    missing_number = total_sum - given_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(nums)\n    print(f\"The missing number is: {missing_number}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Calculate the total number of elements in the sequence (`n`).\n2. Find the starting and ending numbers of the sequence.\n3. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the complete sequence (`total_sum`).\n4. Calculate the sum of the given sequence (`given_sum`).\n5. The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the given sum.\n\nThis function assumes that the input list contains consecutive integers with one number missing. If the input list may contain duplicate numbers or non-consecutive integers, additional error checking and handling will be necessary.",
