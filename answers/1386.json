  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=======================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The game continues until the user decides to quit. The program keeps track of the score and announces the winner at the end.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Plays the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the user.\"\"\"\n    user_score = 0\n    computer_score = 0\n\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit): \").lower()\n        if user_choice == 'quit':\n            break\n\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}! You win this round.\")\n            user_score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}! Computer wins this round.\")\n            computer_score += 1\n\n        print(f\"\\nScore - You: {user_score}, Computer: {computer_score}\\n\")\n\n    if user_score > computer_score:\n        print(\"You are the overall winner! Congratulations!\")\n    elif user_score < computer_score:\n        print(\"The computer is the overall winner. Better luck next time!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's a tie game! Well played!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors, or quit) when prompted.\n2. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner of the round.\n3. The game will continue until you enter 'quit'.\n4.
