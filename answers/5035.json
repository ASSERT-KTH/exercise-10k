The `main` function serves as the program's entry point, presenting a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the bank account manager.\n\n1.  **Account Creation**: Users can create new bank accounts by providing the account number, account name, and initial balance.\n2.  **Account Management**: Users can manage existing accounts by depositing funds, withdrawing funds, or displaying account details.\n3.  **Menu Navigation**: The program uses a combination of `while` loops and `if-elif-else` statements to navigate through the menu options and perform the chosen actions.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `bank_account_manager.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python bank_account_manager.py`). Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create and manage bank accounts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\n1.  Run the program and choose option 1 to create a new account.\n2.  Enter the account number, account name, and initial balance when prompted.\n3.  Choose option 2 to manage the created account.\n4.  Select the account you want to manage from the list of available accounts.\n5.  Choose option 1 to deposit funds, option 2 to withdraw funds, or option 3 to display account details.\n6.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the chosen action.\n7.  Choose option 4 to go back to the main menu or option 3 to exit the program.",
