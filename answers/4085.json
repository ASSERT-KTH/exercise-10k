It first checks if the user's choice and the computer's choice are valid. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it determines the winner based on the game's rules. If the user's choice and the computer's choice are the same, it's a tie. Otherwise, the function checks all possible winning combinations for the user and returns the winner accordingly. If none of the winning combinations match, the computer wins. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function and print the result.",
