  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in a List of Numbers**\n\nHere's an example of how you can use a for loop to find the first duplicate in a given list of numbers:\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    The first duplicate number, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nfirst_duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\nif first_duplicate is not None:\n    print(f\"The first duplicate is: {first_duplicate}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we've encountered so far.\n2. Iterate through the list of numbers using a for loop.\n3. For each number, check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, return the number as it's the first duplicate.\n5. If not, add the number to the `seen` set and continue to the next iteration.\n6. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each element in the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
