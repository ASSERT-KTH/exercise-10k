  "answer": "**Word Counter Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a sentence as input and prints out the number of words.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_words(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of words in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    sentence = sentence.strip()\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Return the number of words\n    return len(words)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    \n    # Count the words\n    word_count = count_words(sentence)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The sentence contains {word_count} words.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a sentence when prompted (e.g., \"Hello world this is a test\").\n3. The program will print out the number of words in the sentence (e.g., \"The sentence contains 6 words.\").\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program considers punctuation as part of a word. If you want to remove punctuation, you can use the `re` module to replace punctuation characters with whitespace before splitting the sentence into words.\n* This program assumes that words are separated by whitespace. If you need to handle other types of word separators (e.g., tabs, newline characters), you can modify the `split()` method accordingly.",
