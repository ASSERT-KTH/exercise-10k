  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a password and checks its validity using conditional statements, considering factors such as length and character type.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks the validity of a password based on certain conditions.\n\n```python\ndef check_password(password):\n    # Define the conditions for a valid password\n    min_length = 8\n    max_length = 20\n    has_uppercase = any(char.isupper() for char in password)\n    has_lowercase = any(char.islower() for char in password)\n    has_digit = any(char.isdigit() for char in password)\n    has_special_char = any(not char.isalnum() for char in password)\n\n    # Check the conditions\n    if len(password) < min_length:\n        print(\"Password should be at least\", min_length, \"characters long.\")\n    elif len(password) > max_length:\n        print(\"Password should be no more than\", max_length, \"characters long.\")\n    elif not has_uppercase:\n        print(\"Password should have at least one uppercase letter.\")\n    elif not has_lowercase:\n        print(\"Password should have at least one lowercase letter.\")\n    elif not has_digit:\n        print(\"Password should have at least one digit.\")\n    elif not has_special_char:\n        print(\"Password should have at least one special character.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is valid.\")\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n    check_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program will ask for a password, then check if it's valid based on the following conditions:\n- The password should be at least 8 characters long.\n- The password should be no more than 20 characters long.\n- The password should have at least one uppercase letter.\n- The password should have at least one lowercase letter.\n- The password should have at least one digit.\n- The password should have at least one special character.\n\nIf the password fails to meet any of these conditions, it will print an error message. If the password meets all the conditions, it will print \"Password is valid.\".\n\nYou can modify the `min_length` and `max_length` variables to change the length requirements for the password. You can also add or remove conditions as needed.",
