  "answer": "**File Input/Output Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates how to read from and write to a file using Python.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef write_to_file(filename, content):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes content to a file.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to write to.\n        content (str): The content to write to the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n            file.write(content)\n        print(f\"Content written to {filename} successfully.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error writing to {filename}: {e}\")\n\n\ndef read_from_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads content from a file.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The name of the file to read from.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The content of the file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n        print(f\"Content read from {filename} successfully.\")\n        return content\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading from {filename}: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n\ndef main():\n    filename = \"example.txt\"\n    content = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n    # Write to file\n    write_to_file(filename, content)\n\n    # Read from file\n    read_content = read_from_file(filename)\n    print(f\"Read content: {read_content}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `write_to_file` function takes a filename and content as input, opens the file in write mode, and writes the content to the file.\n2. The `read_from_file` function takes a filename as input, opens the file in read mode, and returns the content of the file.\n3. In the `main` function, we write a sample content to a file named \"example.txt\" and then read the content from the same file.\n4. The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any errors that may occur during file operations.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Create a new file named \"example.txt\" in the same directory as the Python script.\n* Run the Python script to write the content \"Hello, World!\" to the file.\n* Verify that the content has been written to the file by checking the file's contents.\n* Run the Python script again to read the content from the file and print it to the console.",
