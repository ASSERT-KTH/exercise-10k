  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a score as input and prints out the corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Read a score from the user\nscore = int(input(\"Enter a score: \"))\n\n# Determine the grade\nif score >= 90 and score <= 100:\n    grade = \"A\"\nelif score >= 80 and score <= 89:\n    grade = \"B\"\nelif score >= 70 and score <= 79:\n    grade = \"C\"\nelif score >= 60 and score <= 69:\n    grade = \"D\"\nelse:\n    grade = \"F\"\n\n# Print the grade\nprint(\"Your grade is: \", grade)\n```\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It reads a score from the user using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.\n2. It uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score. Each condition checks the value of the `score` variable against the grade range criteria.\n3. It assigns the corresponding letter grade to the `grade` variable based on the condition that is true.\n4. Finally, it prints the grade to the console using the `print()` function.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the user will enter a valid score between 0 and 100. If the user enters a score outside this range, the code will still work, but the grade may not be accurate. You may want to add additional error checking to handle invalid input.",
