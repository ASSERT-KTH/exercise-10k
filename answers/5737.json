  "answer": "**Processing a List of Numbers with Map, Filter, and Reduce**\n===========================================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function that uses the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions to process a list of numbers. This function will square all numbers in the list, filter out any numbers less than 10, and then calculate the sum of the remaining numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef process_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Process a list of numbers by squaring them, filtering out numbers less than 10, and summing the remaining numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to process.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the squared numbers greater than or equal to 10.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Square all numbers in the list using map\n    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n    \n    # Filter out numbers less than 10 using filter\n    filtered_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x >= 10, squared_numbers))\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the remaining numbers using reduce\n    sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, filtered_numbers, 0)\n\n    return sum_of_numbers\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = process_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squared numbers greater than or equal to 10:\", result)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `map` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a list of the results.\n2.  The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns `True`.\n3.  The `reduce` function applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. In this case, it is used to sum up all the numbers in the list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n-------------------------\n\n1.  Define a function `process_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2.  Use the `map` function to square all numbers in the list.\n3.  Use the `filter` function to filter out numbers less than 10 from the squared list.\n4.  Use the `reduce` function to calculate the sum of the remaining numbers.\n5.  Return the sum of the squared numbers greater than or equal to 10.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\n*   The time complexity of the `map` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n*   The time complexity of the `filter` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n*   The time complexity of the `reduce` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\nOverall, the time complexity of the `process_numbers` function is O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(3n), which simplifies to O(n).",
