  "answer": "**Missing Number Function**\n==========================\n\nThe following function finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of consecutive integers with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input sequence is not a list or is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(sequence, list) or len(sequence) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input sequence must be a non-empty list\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the sequence if it were complete\n    n = len(sequence) + 1\n    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the given sequence\n    sequence_sum = sum(sequence)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the sequence sum\n    missing_number = total_sum - sequence_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5]\n    missing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)\n    print(\"Missing number:\", missing_number)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes a list of consecutive integers with one number missing as input.\n2. It calculates the sum of the sequence if it were complete using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the sequence plus one (to account for the missing number).\n3. It calculates the sum of the given sequence using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. The missing number is found by subtracting the sum of the given sequence from the total sum.\n5. The function returns the missing number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Find the missing number in the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 5]`: `find_missing_number([1, 2, 3, 5])` returns `4`.\n* Find the missing number in the sequence `[10, 11, 12, 14]`: `find_missing_number([10, 11, 12, 14])` returns `13`.",
