  "answer": "**Odd Number Printer Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the number is odd.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(i)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\")\n    print_odd_numbers()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a function `print_odd_numbers` that contains the loop.\n2. We use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is odd by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 != 0`).\n4. If the number is odd, we print it.\n\n### Alternative Implementation using a While Loop\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_numbers_while():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 1\n    while i <= 10:\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(i)\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10 (while loop):\")\n    print_odd_numbers_while()\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOdd numbers from 1 to 10:\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n```\n\nNote: The output will be the same for both the for loop and while loop implementations.",
