  "answer": "**Most Frequent Character Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the most frequent character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_char(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the most frequent character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The most frequent character.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    input_str = input_str.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    \n    # Count character frequencies\n    char_counts = Counter(input_str)\n    \n    # Get the most common character\n    most_common_char = char_counts.most_common(1)\n    \n    # Return the most frequent character\n    return most_common_char[0][0]\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Most frequent character:\", most_frequent_char(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `most_frequent_char` function takes a string as input and removes whitespace and converts it to lowercase.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character.\n3. The `most_common` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a character and its frequency. We use indexing to get the most common character.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `most_frequent_char` function.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the input string only contains ASCII characters. If you need to support non-ASCII characters, you may need to modify the program accordingly.\n* If there are multiple characters with the same highest frequency, this program will return one of them arbitrarily. If you need to return all characters with the highest frequency, you will need to modify the program to handle this case.",
