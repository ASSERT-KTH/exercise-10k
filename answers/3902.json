  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10:\n\n```python\ndef print_multiplication_table(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.\n    \n    Args:\n        number (int): The number for which the multiplication table is printed.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Multiplication table for {number}:\")\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        print(f\"{number} x {i} = {number * i}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number from the user\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    \n    # Print the multiplication table\n    print_multiplication_table(number)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 5\nMultiplication table for 5:\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The `print_multiplication_table` function takes an integer `number` as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.\n2. The `main` function gets a number from the user, calls `print_multiplication_table` with the input number, and prints the result.\n3. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and calculates the product of the input number and the current iteration number.\n4. The result is printed in the format \"number x iteration = product\".",
