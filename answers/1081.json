  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Add the numbers and print the result\n    result = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", result)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n2. The `main` function gets two numbers from the user using the `input` function.\n3. It then calls the `add_numbers` function with the two numbers and stores the result in the `result` variable.\n4. Finally, it prints the result to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `5` and `7`, the program will output `The sum of the two numbers is: 12.0`.\n* If the user enters `3.5` and `2.8`, the program will output `The sum of the two numbers is: 6.3`.\n\nNote: This program uses `float` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers. If you only want to allow integer inputs, you can use `int` instead.",
