The `calculator` function prints the available operations and asks the user to choose one.\n2. It then asks for two numbers and performs the chosen operation.\n3. The result is printed to the console.\n4. The `main` function calls the `calculator` function and asks the user if they want to calculate again. If they do, it calls the `calculator` function again. If not, it says goodbye.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and choose addition. Enter two numbers, for example 5 and 3. The program will print the result, which is 8.\n* Run the program and choose division. Enter two numbers, for example 10 and 2. The program will print the result, which is 5.\n* Run the program and choose division. Enter two numbers, for example 10 and 0. The program will print an error message, because division by zero is not allowed.",
