  "answer": "**Function to Find Character Index in a String**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a character as input and returns the index of the character in the string. If the character is not found, it returns -1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_char_index(input_str, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the character if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the index method to find the index of the character\n        index = input_str.index(char)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the character is not found, return -1\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"W\"\n    index = find_char_index(input_str, char)\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `find_char_index` takes two arguments: `input_str` and `char`.\n2. It uses the `index` method of the string to find the index of the character.\n3. If the character is found, the `index` method returns the index, which is then returned by the function.\n4. If the character is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `find_char_index` with an example string and character.",
