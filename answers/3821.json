  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a name as input and prints out a greeting message with the name.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting message with the given name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print_greeting(name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `print_greeting` that takes a `name` as an argument and prints out a greeting message with the given name. The `main` function asks the user for their name using the built-in `input` function and then calls `print_greeting` with the provided name.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `greeting.py`), then run it from the command line with `python greeting.py`. When prompted, enter your name, and it will print out a greeting message with your name.\n\nHere's an example output:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John!\n```",
