  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a string input from the user and checks if it matches a specific format. The format is 'DD/MM/YYYY', where 'DD' represents the day of the month, 'MM' represents the month, and 'YYYY' represents the year. If the input matches the format, the program should print 'Valid date' and the input date. If the input does not match the format, the program should print 'Invalid date' and prompt the user to enter the date again.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code based on the provided specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        date = input(\"Enter a date (DD/MM/YYYY): \")\n        regex_pattern = re.compile(r'^(\\d{2})/(\\d{2})/(\\d{4})$')\n        match = regex_pattern.match(date)\n\n        if match:\n            day, month, year = match.groups()\n            day = int(day)\n            month = int(month)\n            year = int(year)\n\n            if day > 0 and day <= 31 and month > 0 and month <= 12:\n                print(\"Valid date:\", date)\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid date. Please try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid date. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code will continuously ask the user for a date until a valid date is entered. It checks if the input date matches the 'DD/MM/YYYY' format using a regular expression and then checks if the day and month values are within valid ranges. If the date is valid, it prints a success message and exits the loop. If the date is invalid, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.",
