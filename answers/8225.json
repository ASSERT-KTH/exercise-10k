  "answer": "**Pattern Recognition Program**\n================================\n\nThis program recognizes a pattern in a given sequence of numbers. The pattern can be either an arithmetic sequence (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...) or a geometric sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...).\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef recognize_pattern(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recognize a pattern in a given sequence of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The type of pattern recognized.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(sequence) < 2:\n        return \"Insufficient data to recognize a pattern\"\n\n    # Check for arithmetic sequence\n    diff = sequence[1] - sequence[0]\n    is_arithmetic = all(sequence[i + 1] - sequence[i] == diff for i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1))\n\n    if is_arithmetic:\n        return \"Arithmetic sequence\"\n\n    # Check for geometric sequence\n    ratio = sequence[1] / sequence[0]\n    is_geometric = all(sequence[i + 1] / sequence[i] == ratio for i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1))\n\n    if is_geometric:\n        return \"Geometric sequence\"\n\n    # If no pattern is recognized, return a message\n    return \"No recognizable pattern found\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sequences = [\n        [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],\n        [1, 2, 4, 8, 16],\n        [1, 2, 3, 5, 7],\n        [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n    ]\n\n    for sequence in sequences:\n        print(f\"Sequence: {sequence}\")\n        print(f\"Pattern: {recognize_pattern(sequence)}\")\n        print()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `recognize_pattern` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It first checks if the input sequence has at least two elements. If not, it returns a message indicating insufficient data.\n3. It then checks if the sequence is an arithmetic sequence by verifying that the difference between consecutive elements is constant.\n4. If the sequence is not arithmetic, it checks if it is a geometric sequence by verifying that the ratio between consecutive elements is constant.\n5. If neither pattern is recognized, it returns a message indicating that no recognizable pattern was found.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Recognizing arithmetic sequences: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`\n* Recognizing geometric sequences: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`\n* Handling sequences with no recognizable pattern: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`\n* Handling sequences with insufficient data: `[1]`",
