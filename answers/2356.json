  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter Program**\n======================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_character_frequency` function initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the character frequencies.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, it increments the frequency by 1. Otherwise, it adds the character to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. The `main` function takes a string input from the user, calls the `count_character_frequency` function, and prints the character frequencies.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter a string: hello\nCharacter Frequency:\nh: 1\ne: 1\nl: 2\no: 1\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution using Python's Built-in `Counter` Class\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    return Counter(input_string)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis alternative solution uses the `Counter` class from Python's `collections` module, which provides a concise way to count the frequency of elements in a collection.",
