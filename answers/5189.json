  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their gift card balance and then asks them for the price of an item they want to buy. If the item price is less than or equal to the gift card balance, print a message indicating that the item can be purchased. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the item cannot be purchased.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Get the user's gift card balance\nbalance = float(input(\"Enter the balance on your gift card: \"))\n\n# Get the price of the item\nprice = float(input(\"Enter the price of the item: \"))\n\n# Check if the item can be purchased\nif price <= balance:\n    print(\"You can purchase this item.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You cannot purchase this item.\")\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, asking the user for their gift card balance and the price of the item, and then using a conditional statement to determine whether the item can be purchased based on the gift card balance.",
