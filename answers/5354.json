  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a list and an index as input, and removes the element at the specified index from the list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that removes an element at a specified index from a list. This function will take a list and an index as input and return the modified list. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_element_at_index(input_list, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function removes the element at the specified index from the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list from which the element will be removed.\n        index (int): The index of the element to be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The modified list after removing the element at the specified index.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list.\n    # If it's not, we'll raise an IndexError with a descriptive message.\n    if index < 0 or index >= len(input_list):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the pop method of the list to remove the element at the specified index.\n    # The pop method returns the removed element, but we don't need it in this case, so we'll ignore it.\n    # We'll store the result in a variable to make the code more readable.\n    removed_element = input_list.pop(index)\n\n    # Finally, we'll return the modified list.\n    # We don't need to do anything else here, because the pop method modified the list in-place.\n    return input_list\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(remove_element_at_index(my_list, 2))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_element_at_index` first checks if the provided `index` is within the bounds of the `input_list`. If it's not, an `IndexError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* If the `index` is valid, the function uses the `pop` method of the `input_list` to remove the element at the specified `index`. The `pop` method modifies the list in-place, so there's no need to create a new list.\n* The function then returns the modified `input_list`.\n* Note that the `pop` method returns the removed element, but in this case, it's ignored since we're only interested in the modified list.",
