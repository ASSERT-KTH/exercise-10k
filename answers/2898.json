  "prompt": "Design a program to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers using the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem using the math library for calculating the GCD.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of the input integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    lcm = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        lcm = abs(lcm * num) // math.gcd(lcm, num)\n    return lcm\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 7, 3]\nprint(calculate_lcm(numbers))\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_lcm` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their LCM. It initializes the LCM with the first number in the list and then iterates over the remaining numbers, updating the LCM using the formula `lcm = abs(lcm * num) // math.gcd(lcm, num)`.\n\nThe `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is required for calculating the LCM. The `abs` function is used to ensure the result is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `calculate_lcm` function with a list of numbers `[2, 7, 3]` and prints their LCM.\n\n### How it works:\n\n1.  Initialize the LCM with the first number in the list.\n2.  Iterate over the remaining numbers in the list.\n3.  For each number, calculate the new LCM using the formula `lcm = abs(lcm * num) // math.gcd(lcm, num)`.\n4.  Update the LCM with the new value.\n5.  After iterating over all numbers, return the final LCM.\n\n### Time complexity:\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* log m), where n is the number of input integers and m is the maximum value among the input integers. This is because the `math.gcd` function has a time complexity of O(log m) and is called n times.\n\n### Space complexity:\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input list, making it efficient for large inputs.",
