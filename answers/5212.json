  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest amount based on the principal, rate, and time provided by the user. It uses the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amount after n years, including interest\n- P is the principal amount (initial investment)\n- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal)\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the compound interest amount.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount (initial investment)\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal)\n        time (int): The time the money is invested for in years\n        compounds_per_year (int, optional): The number of times that interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The amount after n years, including interest\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year)**(compounds_per_year*time)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time the money is invested for (in years): \"))\n    compounds_per_year = int(input(\"Enter the number of times that interest is compounded per year (default is 1): \") or 1)\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year)\n\n    print(f\"\\nAfter {time} years, your investment will be worth: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The compound interest amount is: ${amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, time, and number of times that interest is compounded per year when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the amount after the specified time, including interest, and the compound interest amount.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nCompound Interest Calculator\n--------------------------------\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the annual interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time the money is invested for (in years): 10\nEnter the number of times that interest is compounded per year (default is 1): 1\n\nAfter 10 years, your investment will be worth: $1638.62\nThe compound interest amount is: $638.62\n```",
