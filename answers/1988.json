  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\nThis program uses conditional statements to validate a password based on the following requirements:\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password based on the following requirements:\n    * The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n    * The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n    * The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n    * The password must contain at least one digit.\n    * The password must contain at least one special character.\n    \n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password is at least 8 characters long\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the password contains at least one special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    if validate_password(password):\n        print(\"The password is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following requirements:\")\n        print(\"* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n        print(\"* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n        print(\"* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n        print(\"* The password must contain at least one digit.\")\n        print(\"* The password must contain at least one special character.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `validate_password` function takes a password as input and checks if it meets the requirements.\n2. The function uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n3. If the password does not meet any of the requirements, the function returns `False`.\n4. If the password meets all the requirements, the function returns `True`.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a password and calls the `validate_password` function to check if it is valid.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a password that meets all the requirements: `P@ssw0rd`\n* Enter a password that does not meet any of the requirements: `password`\n* Enter a password that meets some of the requirements: `P@ssword`",
