  "answer": "**Variable Lifetime Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\nThe following Python program demonstrates the concept of variable lifetime. It showcases the lifetime of variables in different scopes, including local, global, and static variables.\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    \"\"\"Demonstrates the lifetime of local variables.\"\"\"\n    # Local variable in outer_function\n    outer_local_variable = 20\n\n    def inner_function():\n        \"\"\"Demonstrates the lifetime of local variables in nested functions.\"\"\"\n        # Local variable in inner_function\n        inner_local_variable = 30\n        print(\"Inner function: global_variable =\", global_variable)\n        print(\"Inner function: outer_local_variable =\", outer_local_variable)\n        print(\"Inner function: inner_local_variable =\", inner_local_variable)\n\n    print(\"Outer function: global_variable =\", global_variable)\n    print(\"Outer function: outer_local_variable =\", outer_local_variable)\n    inner_function()\n\ndef static_variable_example():\n    \"\"\"Demonstrates the concept of static variables.\"\"\"\n    if not hasattr(static_variable_example, \"static_variable\"):\n        static_variable_example.static_variable = 0\n    static_variable_example.static_variable += 1\n    print(\"Static variable:\", static_variable_example.static_variable)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Global variable before outer_function:\", global_variable)\n    outer_function()\n    print(\"Global variable after outer_function:\", global_variable)\n    static_variable_example()  # Static variable: 1\n    static_variable_example()  # Static variable: 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nGlobal variable before outer_function: 10\nOuter function: global_variable = 10\nOuter function: outer_local_variable = 20\nInner function: global_variable = 10\nInner function: outer_local_variable = 20\nInner function: inner_local_variable = 30\nGlobal variable after outer_function: 10\nStatic variable: 1\nStatic variable: 2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `global_variable` is accessible throughout the program and retains its value across function calls.\n*   The `outer_local_variable` is only accessible within the `outer_function` and is destroyed when the function returns.\n*   The `inner_local_variable` is only accessible within the `inner_function` and is destroyed when the function returns.\n*   The `static_variable_example` function demonstrates the concept of static variables, which retain their value across function calls.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Global variables** have a lifetime that spans the entire program execution.\n*   **Local variables** have a lifetime that spans the execution of their enclosing function or block.\n*   **Static variables** retain their value across function calls and have a lifetime that spans the entire program execution.",
