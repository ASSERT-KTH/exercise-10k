  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints out their sum, difference, product, and quotient using helper functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Version: 1.0\n# Description: This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations on them.\n\ndef sum(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the sum of two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef difference(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the difference of two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a - b\n\ndef product(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the product of two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\ndef quotient(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the quotient of two numbers\"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    return a / b\n\ndef main():\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum(num1, num2)}\")\n    print(f\"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is: {difference(num1, num2)}\")\n    print(f\"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {product(num1, num2)}\")\n    print(f\"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is: {quotient(num1, num2)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've added a check in the `quotient` function to handle division by zero, and I've also used f-strings to format the output in the `main` function. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!",
