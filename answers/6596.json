  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character in a String**\n==============================================\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string, then iterates through the string to find the first non-repeating character.\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate through the string to find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    s = \"aabbc\"\n    result = first_non_repeating_char(s)\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The first non-repeating character in '{s}' is '{result}'\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No non-repeating character found in '{s}'\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  Create a dictionary `char_count` to store the count of each character in the string.\n2.  Iterate through the string to count the occurrences of each character.\n3.  Iterate through the string again to find the first character with a count of 1.\n4.  If no non-repeating character is found, return None.\n\n**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n**Space complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\nThis solution is efficient and easy to understand. It uses a dictionary to store the count of each character, which allows for fast lookup and counting. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result.",
