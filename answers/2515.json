  "answer": "**Assignment Score Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average score and corresponding grade for several assignments.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_score(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average score from a list of scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of assignment scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average score.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n\ndef determine_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The average score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of assignments\n    num_assignments = int(input(\"Enter the number of assignments: \"))\n\n    # Get the scores for each assignment\n    scores = []\n    for i in range(num_assignments):\n        score = float(input(f\"Enter the score for assignment {i+1}: \"))\n        scores.append(score)\n\n    # Calculate the average score\n    average_score = calculate_average_score(scores)\n\n    # Determine the grade\n    grade = determine_grade(average_score)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Average Score: {average_score:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of assignments when prompted.\n3. Enter the score for each assignment when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the average score and corresponding grade.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple grading scale:\n\t+ A: 90-100\n\t+ B: 80-89\n\t+ C: 70-79\n\t+ D: 60-69\n\t+ F: Below 60\n* You can modify the grading scale by adjusting the `determine_grade` function.\n* The program assumes that all scores are between 0 and 100. You may want to add input validation to handle invalid scores.",
