  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should take an integer score as input and output the corresponding grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Based on your detailed specification, I will write the code in Python. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    # Check the score and return the corresponding grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Main program\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\ngrade = calculate_grade(score)\nprint(\"Your grade is:\", grade)\n```\n\nThis code follows the detailed specification provided, including the function to calculate the grade, the main program, and the execution of the code. It correctly calculates the grade based on the score and outputs the corresponding grade.",
