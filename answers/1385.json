  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares():\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        total += i ** 2\n    return total\n\nprint(sum_of_squares())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `sum_of_squares` that initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of squares.\n*   We use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10. The `range(1, 11)` function generates these numbers.\n*   Inside the loop, we calculate the square of each number using the exponentiation operator `**` and add it to `total`.\n*   After the loop finishes, we return the `total`, which now holds the sum of squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.\n*   Finally, we call the `sum_of_squares` function and print the result.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nYou can also use a list comprehension and the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of squares in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares():\n    return sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11))\n\nprint(sum_of_squares())\n```\n\nThis version of the function does the same thing as the previous one but in a single line of code. It uses a generator expression to calculate the squares and then passes them to the `sum` function.",
