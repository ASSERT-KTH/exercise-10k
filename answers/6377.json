  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(array1, array2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array1 (list): The first input array.\n    array2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the input arrays to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency\n    set1 = set(array1)\n    set2 = set(array2)\n\n    # Use the set intersection operation to find the elements common to both arrays\n    common = set1.intersection(set2)\n\n    # Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it\n    return list(common)\n\n# Example usage:\narray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\ncommon = common_elements(array1, array2)\nprint(common)  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `common_elements` that takes two input arrays, `array1` and `array2`. We convert these arrays to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements and improves lookup efficiency. We then use the `intersection` method to find the elements that are common to both sets. Finally, we convert the resulting set back to a list and return it.\n\nNote that the order of elements in the output array may not be the same as the order in the input arrays, since sets are unordered data structures. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements_ordered(array1, array2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays, in the order they appeared in the first array.\n\n    Parameters:\n    array1 (list): The first input array.\n    array2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays, in the order they appeared in the first array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the second array to a set for efficient lookup\n    set2 = set(array2)\n\n    # Use a list comprehension to find the elements in the first array that are also in the second array\n    common = [element for element in array1 if element in set2]\n\n    # Return the resulting list\n    return common\n\n# Example usage:\narray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\ncommon = common_elements_ordered(array1, array2)\nprint(common)  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the first array, checking each element to see if it is also in the second array (which has been converted to a set for efficient lookup). The resulting list contains the elements that are common to both arrays, in the order they appeared in the first array.",
