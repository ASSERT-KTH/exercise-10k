  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and performs the operation on the numbers. The operations to support are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handle invalid operations and division by zero errors.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the given arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the supported operations\n    supported_operations = {\n        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operation is supported\n    if operation not in supported_operations:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported operation: {operation}. Supported operations are: {list(supported_operations.keys())}\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    try:\n        result = supported_operations[operation](num1, num2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operation from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    print(\"Available operations:\")\n    print(\"1. Add\")\n    print(\"2. Subtract\")\n    print(\"3. Multiply\")\n    print(\"4. Divide\")\n\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter the number of your chosen operation: \"))\n\n    operations = {\n        1: 'add',\n        2: 'subtract',\n        3: 'multiply',\n        4: 'divide'\n    }\n\n    operation = operations.get(choice)\n\n    if operation is None:\n        print(\"Invalid operation choice.\")\n        return\n\n    # Perform the operation and print the result\n    try:\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result of {operation}ing {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first number when prompted.\n3. Enter the second number when prompted.\n4. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.\n5. The program will display the result of the operation or an error message if something goes wrong.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operation as input, performs the operation, and returns the result.\n* The `main` function gets the numbers and operation from the user, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result or an error message.\n* The program handles invalid operations and division by zero errors by raising exceptions and printing error messages.\n* The program uses a dictionary to map operation names to lambda functions, making it easy to add or remove supported operations.\n* The program uses a `try-except` block to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the calculation.",
