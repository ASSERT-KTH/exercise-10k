  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a string representing a mathematical expression involving basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and evaluates its validity. The program should check if the expression is mathematically correct and does not result in division by zero. If the expression is valid, the program should calculate and return the result of the expression.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\n# Importing Libraries\nimport re\n\n# Defining the Function\ndef solve(expression):\n    # Checking for Division by Zero\n    if '/0' in expression:\n        return 'Division by zero'\n\n    # Evaluating the Expression\n    try:\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        return str(e)\n\n# Test the Function\nprint(solve(\"1 + 2 * 3\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(solve(\"1 + 2 / 0\"))  # Output: Division by zero\n```\nNote that I've used the `eval()` function to evaluate the mathematical expression, which can be a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input. However, for the purpose of this exercise, it should be sufficient. Also, I've used a simple `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during evaluation, and return the exception message as a string.",
