  "answer": "**Determining Days in a Month Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program takes a month and year as input and determines the number of days in that month.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef days_in_month(month, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of days in a given month and year.\n    \n    Args:\n    month (int): The month (1-12)\n    year (int): The year\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of days in the month\n    \"\"\"\n    if month == 2:\n        # Check for leap year\n        if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):\n            return 29\n        else:\n            return 28\n    elif month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:\n        # Months with 31 days\n        return 31\n    else:\n        # Months with 30 days\n        return 30\n\ndef main():\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    \n    if 1 <= month <= 12:\n        print(f\"There are {days_in_month(month, year)} days in month {month} of year {year}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid month. Please enter a month between 1 and 12.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `days_in_month` function takes a month and year as input.\n2. It checks if the month is February (2). If it is, it checks if the year is a leap year.\n3. If the year is a leap year, it returns 29 days for February. Otherwise, it returns 28 days.\n4. For all other months, it checks if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December).\n5. If the month does not have 31 days, it checks if the month has 30 days (April, June, September, November).\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a month and year.\n7. It calls the `days_in_month` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter the month: 2, Enter the year: 2020 (leap year)\nOutput: There are 29 days in month 2 of year 2020.\n* Enter the month: 2, Enter the year: 2021 (not a leap year)\nOutput: There are 28 days in month 2 of year 2021.\n* Enter the month: 1, Enter the year: 2022\nOutput: There are 31 days in month 1 of year 2022.\n* Enter the month: 4, Enter the year: 2022\nOutput: There are 30 days in month 4 of year 2022.",
