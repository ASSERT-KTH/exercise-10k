  "answer": "**Transposing a List of Lists**\n=====================================\n\nThe following Python function takes a list of lists as input and returns the transposed list.\n\n```python\ndef transpose(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transpose a given list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n    list_of_lists (list): A list of lists to be transposed.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The transposed list of lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(map(list, zip(*list_of_lists)))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n    print(\"Original List:\")\n    for row in list_of_lists:\n        print(row)\n    \n    transposed_list = transpose(list_of_lists)\n    print(\"\\nTransposed List:\")\n    for row in transposed_list:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `zip(*list_of_lists)` expression unpacks the input list of lists and applies the `zip` function to the resulting arguments. This has the effect of transposing the list.\n2. The `map(list, ...)` expression converts each tuple returned by `zip` into a list.\n3. The `list(...)` expression converts the iterator returned by `map` into a list.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal List:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[7, 8, 9]\n\nTransposed List:\n[1, 4, 7]\n[2, 5, 8]\n[3, 6, 9]\n```",
