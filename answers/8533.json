  "answer": "**Meal Cost Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of a meal after applying a tip percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of a meal after applying a tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the meal.\n    \"\"\"\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    total_cost = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the meal cost and tip percentage from the user\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Meal Cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip Percentage: {tip_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Tip Amount: ${meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100):.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the cost of the meal when prompted (e.g., `25.99`).\n3. Enter the tip percentage when prompted (e.g., `15`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the total cost of the meal, including the tip amount.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple formula to calculate the tip amount: `tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)`.\n* The `calculate_total_cost` function takes two arguments: `meal_cost` and `tip_percentage`.\n* The `main` function gets the meal cost and tip percentage from the user, calculates the total cost, and prints the result.\n* The program uses `float` to handle decimal values and `:.2f` to format the output to two decimal places.",
