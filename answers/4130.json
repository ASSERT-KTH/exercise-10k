  "answer": "**Variable Scope Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and can be accessed. In this demonstration, we will explore the concept of variable scope by declaring variables in different scopes.\n\n**Global Scope**\n----------------\n\nA global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any function or block. It can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n\n```python\n# Global variable\nglobal_variable = \"I am a global variable\"\n\ndef print_global_variable():\n    print(global_variable)\n\nprint_global_variable()  # Outputs: I am a global variable\n```\n\n**Local Scope**\n----------------\n\nA local variable is a variable that is defined inside a function or block. It can only be accessed within that function or block.\n\n```python\ndef print_local_variable():\n    # Local variable\n    local_variable = \"I am a local variable\"\n    print(local_variable)\n\nprint_local_variable()  # Outputs: I am a local variable\n\n# Trying to access local_variable outside its scope will raise an error\ntry:\n    print(local_variable)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"Error: local_variable is not defined\")\n```\n\n**Enclosing Scope**\n-------------------\n\nAn enclosing scope is a scope that contains another scope. In Python, this occurs when a function is defined inside another function.\n\n```python\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing variable\n    enclosing_variable = \"I am an enclosing variable\"\n\n    def inner_function():\n        print(enclosing_variable)\n\n    inner_function()\n\nouter_function()  # Outputs: I am an enclosing variable\n```\n\n**Built-in Scope**\n------------------\n\nA built-in scope refers to the scope of built-in functions and variables. These are predefined by the language and can be accessed from anywhere.\n\n```python\n# Built-in function\nprint(len(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Outputs: 13\n\n# Built-in variable\nimport math\nprint(math.pi)  # Outputs: 3.14159265359\n```\n\n**Variable Scope Resolution**\n-----------------------------\n\nWhen a variable is accessed, Python follows the LEGB rule to resolve its scope:\n\n1. **L**ocal: Check if the variable is defined in the local scope.\n2. **E**nclosing: Check if the variable is defined in the enclosing scope.\n3. **G**lobal: Check if the variable is defined in the global scope.\n4. **B**uilt-in: Check if the variable is a built-in function or variable.\n\n```python\nx = 10  # Global variable\n\ndef outer_function():\n    x = 20  # Enclosing variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        x = 30  # Local variable\n        print(\"Local:\", x)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Enclosing:\", x)\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global:\", x)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nLocal: 30\nEnclosing: 20\nGlobal: 10\n```\n\nIn this example, the `x` variable is accessed in different scopes, and Python resolves its scope according to the LEGB rule.",
