  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a guess until they guess a predetermined secret number.\n\n```python\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Define the secret number\n    secret_number = 42\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    # Loop until the user guesses the secret number\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number: \")\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n---------------------------\n\n1. The program defines a secret number (`secret_number`) and initializes a counter to track the number of attempts (`attempts`).\n2. The program enters a while loop, which continues until the user guesses the secret number.\n3. Inside the loop, the program asks the user for their guess and attempts to convert the input to an integer.\n4. If the input is not a valid integer, the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n5. If the input is a valid integer, the program increments the `attempts` counter and checks if the user's guess is correct.\n6. If the user's guess is too low or too high, the program prints a hint and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n7. If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a congratulatory message and exits the loop.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, simply copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python number_guessing_game.py`). Then, follow the prompts to play the game.",
