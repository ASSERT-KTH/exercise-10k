  "answer": "**Character Occurrence Counter Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_character_occurrences(input_string: str, character: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n        character (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(character) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Character must be a single character\")\n\n    return input_string.count(character)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    occurrences = count_character_occurrences(input_str, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string '{input_str}'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `count_character_occurrences` takes two parameters: `input_string` and `character`.\n2. It checks if the `character` is a single character. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It uses the built-in `count` method of the string to count the occurrences of the character.\n4. The function returns the count of occurrences.\n5. In the example usage, we call the function with a sample string and character, and print the result.",
