  "answer": "Here is a Python program to calculate the standard deviation of all elements in a given array:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The mean of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(array) / len(array)\n\n\ndef calculate_variance(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(array)\n    return sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in array) / len(array)\n\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    variance = calculate_variance(array)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example array\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    # Calculate and print the standard deviation\n    standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(array)\n    print(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines three functions:\n\n1. `calculate_mean(array)`: calculates the mean of an array by summing all elements and dividing by the number of elements.\n2. `calculate_variance(array)`: calculates the variance of an array by summing the squared differences between each element and the mean, and then dividing by the number of elements.\n3. `calculate_standard_deviation(array)`: calculates the standard deviation of an array by taking the square root of the variance.\n\nThe `main()` function demonstrates how to use these functions with an example array.\n\nNote: This program calculates the population standard deviation. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation, you should divide by `len(array) - 1` instead of `len(array)` when calculating the variance.",
