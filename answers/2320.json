  "answer": "**Hangman Game Program**\n======================================\n\n### Game Overview\n\nThis program plays a game of Hangman with the user. The computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's gallows appears. The game ends when the user guesses the word or the gallows is complete and the player is \"hanged.\"\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nHANGMAN_PICS = ['''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n      |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n  |   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|   |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n      |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n /    |\n      |\n=========''', '''\n  +---+\n  |   |\n  O   |\n /|\\  |\n / \\  |\n      |\n=========''']\n\nWORDS = 'ant baboon badger bat bear beaver camel cat clam cobra cougar coyote crow deer dog donkey duck eagle ferret fox frog goat goose hawk lion lizard llama mole monkey moose mouse mule newt otter owl panda parrot pigeon python rabbit ram rat raven rhino salmon seal shark sheep skunk sloth snake spider stork swan tiger toad trout turkey turtle weasel whale wolf wombat zebra'.split()\n\ndef getRandomWord(wordList):\n    # This function returns a random string from the passed list of strings.\n    wordIndex = random.randint(0, len(wordList) - 1)\n    return wordList[wordIndex]\n\ndef displayBoard(HANGMAN_PICS, missedLetters, correctLetters, secretWord):\n    print(HANGMAN_PICS[len(missedLetters)])\n    print()\n\n    print('Missed letters:', end=' ')\n    for letter in missedLetters:\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\n    blanks = '_' * len(secretWord)\n\n    for i in range(len(secretWord)): # replace blanks with correctly guessed letters\n        if secretWord[i] in correctLetters:\n            blanks = blanks[:i] + secretWord[i] + blanks[i+1:]\n\n    for letter in blanks: # show the secret word with spaces in between each letter\n        print(letter, end=' ')\n    print()\n\ndef getGuess(alreadyGuessed):\n    # Returns the letter the player entered.
