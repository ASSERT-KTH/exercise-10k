  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Tournament Simulator**\n=============================================\n\nThis program simulates a tournament of Rock Paper Scissors games between multiple players. Each player is assigned a random strategy, and the tournament is played in a round-robin format.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Player:\n    \"\"\"Represents a player in the tournament.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.wins = 0\n        self.losses = 0\n        self.ties = 0\n\n    def play(self):\n        \"\"\"Returns the player's move (rock, paper, or scissors).\"\"\"\n        # Randomly select a move\n        moves = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n        return random.choice(moves)\n\n    def update_record(self, result):\n        \"\"\"Updates the player's win/loss record.\"\"\"\n        if result == 'win':\n            self.wins += 1\n        elif result == 'loss':\n            self.losses += 1\n        else:\n            self.ties += 1\n\ndef determine_winner(player1_move, player2_move):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of a game.\"\"\"\n    if player1_move == player2_move:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (player1_move == 'rock' and player2_move == 'scissors') or \\\n       (player1_move == 'paper' and player2_move == 'rock') or \\\n       (player1_move == 'scissors' and player2_move == 'paper'):\n        return 'player1'\n    return 'player2'\n\ndef play_game(player1, player2):\n    \"\"\"Plays a game between two players.\"\"\"\n    player1_move = player1.play()\n    player2_move = player2.play()\n    print(f\"{player1.name} plays {player1_move}, {player2.name} plays {player2_move}\")\n    winner = determine_winner(player1_move, player2_move)\n    if winner == 'tie':\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n        player1.update_record('tie')\n        player2.update_record('tie')\n    elif winner == 'player1':\n        print(f\"{player1.name} wins!\")\n        player1.update_record('win')\n        player2.update_record('loss')\n    else:\n        print(f\"{player2.name} wins!\")\n        player1.update_record('loss')\n        player2.update_record('win')\n\ndef play_tournament(players):\n    \"\"\"Plays a round-robin tournament between multiple players.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(players)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(players)):\n            play_game(players[i], players[j])\n\ndef print_standings(players):\n    \"\"\"Prints the standings after the tournament.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Standings:\")\n    for player in players:\n        print(f\"{player.name}: {player.wins} wins, {player.losses} losses, {player.ties} ties\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Create players\n    num_players = 5\n    players = [Player(f\"Player {i+1}\") for i in range(num_players)]\n\n    # Play tournament\n    play_tournament(players)\n\n    # Print standings\n    print_standings(players)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `main` function. The program will create a specified number of players (in this case, 5), play a round-robin tournament between them, and print the standings after the tournament.\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. Each player is assigned a random strategy, which is used to determine their move in each game.\n2. The tournament is played in a round-robin format, with each player playing every other player exactly once.\n3. In each game, the winner is determined by the game's rules (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper).\n4. The winner of each game is updated in the player's win/loss record.\n5. After the tournament, the standings are printed, showing each player's win/loss record.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random strategy for each player, but you could modify the `play` method to use a more complex strategy if desired.",
