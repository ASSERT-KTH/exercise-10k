  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and tells them how old they will be in 5 years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Gets user's name and age from input.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Age should be a number.\")\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_greeting(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Prints out a greeting message with the user's name and their age in 5 years.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are currently {age} years old.\")\n    print(f\"In 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_greeting(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user for their name and age using the `input` function.\n2. **Input Validation**: The program checks if the input for age is a valid integer. If not, it asks for the age again until a valid integer is entered.\n3. **Greeting Message**: The program then prints out a greeting message with the user's name and their current age.\n4. **Age in 5 Years**: The program calculates the user's age in 5 years by adding 5 to their current age and prints out the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are currently 30 years old.\nIn 5 years, you will be 35 years old.\n```",
