  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input. Based on the operator, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs arithmetic operations based on the given operator.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to use. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operator is valid\n    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator. Only '+', '-', '*', and '/' are supported.\")\n\n    # Perform the corresponding arithmetic operation\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the arithmetic operation and print the result\n        result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operator)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `arithmetic_operation` that takes two numbers and an operator as input, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, and returns the result. The `main` function gets user input, calls `arithmetic_operation`, and prints the result. It also includes error handling for invalid operators and division by zero.",
