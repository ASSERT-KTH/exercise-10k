  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that manages a bank account based on user input using if/else statements:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_name = account_name\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposit of ${amount} successful. New balance is ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient balance.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawal of ${amount} successful. New balance is ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance is ${self.balance}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(\"123456789\", \"John Doe\", 1000)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. We define a `BankAccount` class with attributes for account number, account name, and balance. The class has methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.\n2. In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `BankAccount` class with an initial balance of $1000.\n3. We use a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n4. Based on the user's choice, we use if/else statements to perform the corresponding action:\n\t* If the user chooses to deposit, we prompt them for the amount and call the `deposit` method.\n\t* If the user chooses to withdraw, we prompt them for the amount and call the `withdraw` method. We also check if the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance and display an error message if so.\n\t* If the user chooses to check balance, we call the `check_balance` method.\n\t* If the user chooses to exit, we break out of the loop and end the program.\n5. If the user enters an invalid choice, we display an error message and prompt them to try again.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Deposit: Enter `1` as your choice, then enter the amount to deposit (e.g., `500`). The program will update the balance and display a success message.\n* Withdraw: Enter `2` as your choice, then enter the amount to withdraw (e.g., `200`). The program will update the balance and display a success message. If you try to withdraw more than the current balance, the program will display an error message.\n* Check Balance: Enter `3` as your choice. The program will display the current balance.\n* Exit: Enter `4` as your choice. The program will exit and display a farewell message.",
