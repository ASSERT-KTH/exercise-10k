  "answer": "**Student Grade Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their score. It uses conditional statements to determine the grade level.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade level.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to get the score from the user and display the grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n\n    # Validate the score\n    while score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95: The program will output \"The student's grade is: A\"\n* Enter a score of 75: The program will output \"The student's grade is: C\"\n* Enter a score of 45: The program will output \"The student's grade is: F\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and uses conditional statements to determine the grade level.\n2. The `main` function gets the score from the user and validates it to ensure it is between 0 and 100.\n3. The `calculate_grade` function is called with the validated score, and the grade is displayed to the user.\n\n### Grade Levels\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60",
