  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order using a basic algorithm (such as bubble sort or selection sort), and then prints the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    # Calculate the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate over the array n-1 times\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        # Initialize a flag to check if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n        \n        # Iterate over the array from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n-i-1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        \n        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the array is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nsorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\nThis code implements the bubble sort algorithm, which works by repeatedly iterating over the array and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.\n\nThe `bubble_sort` function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sorted array. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with an example array and print the original and sorted arrays.",
