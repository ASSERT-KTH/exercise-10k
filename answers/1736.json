  "answer": "**First Duplicate Value Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a list of numbers as input and returns the first duplicate value. If no duplicates are found, it returns `None`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate value in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or None: The first duplicate value, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    nums = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(nums)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate value is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we've seen so far.\n2. We iterate through the input list `nums`.\n3. For each number, we check if it's already in the `seen` set. If it is, we return it as the first duplicate value.\n4. If the number is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue to the next number.\n5. If we reach the end of the list without finding a duplicate, we return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we're doing a constant-time operation (set lookup) for each element in the list. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
