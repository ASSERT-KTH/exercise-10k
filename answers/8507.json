  "prompt": "Write a program that determines a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef determine_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score\"\n\n    # Determine the grade based on the score\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = determine_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `determine_grade` that takes the student's score as an argument and returns the corresponding grade.\n2.  We check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100). If not, we return an \"Invalid score\" message.\n3.  We use if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score. The conditions are checked in descending order of scores to ensure that the highest grade is assigned first.\n4.  In the `main` function, we take the student's score as input, determine the grade using the `determine_grade` function, and print the result.",
