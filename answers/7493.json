  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations\n\nBelow is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations using variables and prints out the results.\n\n```python\n# Define two variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\n\n# Perform addition\naddition_result = num1 + num2\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n# Perform subtraction\nsubtraction_result = num1 - num2\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n# Perform multiplication\nmultiplication_result = num1 * num2\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n# Perform division\nif num2 != 0:\n    division_result = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We start by defining two variables, `num1` and `num2`, with values 10 and 2, respectively.\n*   Then, we perform the basic arithmetic operations:\n    *   Addition: `num1 + num2`\n    *   Subtraction: `num1 - num2`\n    *   Multiplication: `num1 * num2`\n    *   Division: `num1 / num2` (with a check to prevent division by zero)\n*   Finally, we print out the results of each operation using f-strings for formatted output.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nAddition: 10 + 2 = 12\nSubtraction: 10 - 2 = 8\nMultiplication: 10 * 2 = 20\nDivision: 10 / 2 = 5.0\n```",
