  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the factorial of a given number using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate factorial\ndef factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# Get the number from user\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Check if number is non-negative\nif num < 0:\n    print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. We define a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a number `n`.\n2. Inside the function, we initialize a variable `result` to 1.\n3. We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and multiply `result` by each number in the range.\n4. After the loop, `result` will be the factorial of `n`, which we return.\n5. We ask the user to input a number and check if it's non-negative (since factorial is not defined for negative numbers).\n6. If the number is non-negative, we call the `factorial(n)` function and print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- If the user inputs `5`, the program will output `Factorial of 5 is 120`.\n- If the user inputs `-3`, the program will output `Factorial is not defined for negative numbers`.",
