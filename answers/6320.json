  "answer": "Intersection of Two Dictionaries\n==============================\n\nYou can find the intersection between two dictionaries by comparing their keys and values. Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the intersection between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the common key-value pairs.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in dict1.items() if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value}\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\nintersection = dict_intersection(dict1, dict2)\nprint(intersection)  # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n\nThis function uses dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs in `dict1` and checks if the key exists in `dict2` with the same value. If both conditions are met, the key-value pair is included in the resulting dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `set` intersection operation to find the common keys and then create a new dictionary with the corresponding values:\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection(dict1, dict2):\n    common_keys = set(dict1.keys()) & set(dict2.keys())\n    return {key: dict1[key] for key in common_keys if dict1[key] == dict2[key]}\n```\n\nBoth approaches will yield the same result, but the first one is more concise and efficient.\n\n### Finding Intersection by Keys Only\n\nIf you only want to find the common keys between two dictionaries, regardless of their values, you can use the `set` intersection operation:\n\n```python\ndef dict_intersection_by_keys(dict1, dict2):\n    return set(dict1.keys()) & set(dict2.keys())\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 4}\n\ncommon_keys = dict_intersection_by_keys(dict1, dict2)\nprint(common_keys)  # Output: {'b', 'c'}\n```\n\nThis function returns a set of common keys between the two dictionaries.",
