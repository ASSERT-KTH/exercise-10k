  "answer": "**Factorial Calculator using Recursion**\n======================================\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nCalculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python program that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    elif n > 1:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n    # Error case: factorial is not defined for negative numbers\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    try:\n        result = factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial.\n\n*   The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.\n*   The recursive case is when `n` is greater than 1, in which case the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function by prompting the user to enter a number and then printing the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the factorial of 5: `factorial(5)` returns `120`\n*   Calculate the factorial of 0: `factorial(0)` returns `1`\n*   Calculate the factorial of a negative number: `factorial(-1)` raises a `ValueError`",
