  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for the weight of a package and calculates the shipping cost based on the following rates: $2.50 per pound for packages up to 2 pounds, $2.00 per pound for packages between 2 and 6 pounds, and $1.50 per pound for packages over 6 pounds.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_shipping_cost(weight):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the shipping cost of a package based on its weight.\n\n    The shipping rates are:\n    - $2.50 per pound for packages up to 2 pounds\n    - $2.00 per pound for packages between 2 and 6 pounds\n    - $1.50 per pound for packages over 6 pounds\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): The weight of the package in pounds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The shipping cost of the package.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if weight <= 2:\n        # Packages up to 2 pounds cost $2.50 per pound\n        cost = weight * 2.50\n    elif weight <= 6:\n        # Packages between 2 and 6 pounds cost $2.00 per pound\n        cost = weight * 2.00\n    else:\n        # Packages over 6 pounds cost $1.50 per pound\n        cost = weight * 1.50\n\n    return cost\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for the weight of the package\n    while True:\n        try:\n            weight = float(input(\"Enter the weight of the package in pounds: \"))\n            if weight < 0:\n                print(\"Weight cannot be negative.

The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the shipping rate based on the package's weight. The `main` function asks the user for the package's weight, calculates the shipping cost using the `calculate_shipping_cost` function, and prints the result. The program also includes input validation to ensure the user enters a non-negative number.",
