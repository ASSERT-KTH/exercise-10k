  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n2. It checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the `len` function to get the count of numbers.\n4. It returns the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[25, 30, 28, 22, 26]`\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code in a file named `average_calculator.py` and run it using Python:\n```bash\npython average_calculator.py\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nThe average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0\n```",
