  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_fibonacci(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        print(a, end=' ')\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        i += 1\n\n# Print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence\nprint_fibonacci(10)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `print_fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. It uses two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the last two numbers in the sequence, and a while loop to generate the sequence.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1.  Initialize `a` to 0 and `b` to 1, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2.  Initialize a counter `i` to 0.\n3.  Enter a while loop that continues until `i` is no longer less than `n`.\n4.  Inside the loop, print the current value of `a`.\n5.  Update `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence by setting `a` to `b` and `b` to the sum of `a` and `b`.\n6.  Increment `i` by 1.\n7.  Repeat steps 4-6 until the loop exits.\n8.  Call the `print_fibonacci` function with `n = 10` to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`.",
