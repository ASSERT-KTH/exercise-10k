  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the shipping cost based on the weight and distance of the package. If the weight is less than 1 kg and the distance is less than 100 km, the shipping cost is $5. If the weight is between 1 kg and 5 kg and the distance is between 100 km and 500 km, the shipping cost is $10. If the weight is above 5 kg or the distance is above 500 km, the shipping cost is $20.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_shipping_cost(weight, distance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the shipping cost based on the weight and distance of the package.\n\n    Args:\n    weight (float): The weight of the package in kg.\n    distance (float): The distance to be shipped in km.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The shipping cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    if weight < 1 and distance < 100:\n        # If the weight is less than 1 kg and the distance is less than 100 km, the shipping cost is $5.\n        return 5\n    elif 1 <= weight <= 5 and 100 <= distance <= 500:\n        # If the weight is between 1 kg and 5 kg and the distance is between 100 km and 500 km, the shipping cost is $10.\n        return 10\n    else:\n        # If the weight is above 5 kg or the distance is above 500 km, the shipping cost is $20.\n        return 20\n\n# Example usage\nweight = 3  # kg\ndistance = 200  # km\nshipping_cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight, distance)\nprint(f\"The shipping cost for a package weighing {weight} kg and being shipped {distance} km is ${shipping_cost}.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_shipping_cost` that takes the weight and distance as input and returns the shipping cost. It uses if-elif-else statements to determine the shipping cost based on the given conditions. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use this function with a specific weight and distance.",
