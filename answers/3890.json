  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes user input for a quiz and determines the score based on the correct answers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and correct answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Paris\",\n        \"B\": \"London\",\n        \"C\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"correct\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"correct\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n        \"C\": \"Claude Monet\",\n        \"D\": \"Pablo Picasso\",\n        \"correct\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef run_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"Run the quiz and calculate the score.\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"correct\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"correct\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {options['correct']}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the program.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    score = run_quiz(quiz_questions)\n    print(f\"Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `quiz_questions` with questions, options, and correct answers.\n2. The `run_quiz` function takes the quiz questions as input and runs the quiz.\n3. For each question, it prints the question and options, asks the user for an answer, and checks if the answer is correct.\n4. If the answer is correct, it increments the score and prints a success message. If the answer is incorrect, it prints an error message with the correct answer.\n5. The `main` function runs the quiz and prints the final score.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the script. The program will prompt the user to answer each question, and then display the final score.\n\n```\nWelcome to the quiz!\nWhat is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nB: London\nC: Berlin\nD: Rome\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): A\nCorrect!\n\nWhat is the largest planet in our solar system?\nA: Earth\nB: Saturn\nC: Jupiter\nD: Uranus\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): C\nCorrect!\n\nWho painted the Starry Night?\nA: Leonardo da Vinci\nB: Vincent van Gogh\nC: Claude Monet\nD: Pablo Picasso\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): B\nCorrect!\n\nYour final score is 3 out of 3\n```",
