  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs the specified functionality:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The arithmetic operation. Can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is '/' and num2 is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operation == '+':\n        # Add the numbers\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        # Subtract num2 from num1\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        # Multiply the numbers\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        # Divide num1 by num2\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for numbers and operation\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the result\n        result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   This program defines a function `calculate` that takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result.\n*   It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n*   The function includes error handling for invalid operations and division by zero.\n*   The `main` function gets user input for numbers and operation, calls the `calculate` function, and prints the result.\n*   It also catches and prints any errors that occur during the calculation.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: `calculate(5, 3, '+')` returns `8`\n*   Subtraction: `calculate(10, 4, '-')` returns `6`\n*   Multiplication: `calculate(7, 2, '*')` returns `14`\n*   Division: `calculate(9, 3, '/')` returns `3.0`\n\nYou can run the program and follow the prompts to test it with different inputs.",
