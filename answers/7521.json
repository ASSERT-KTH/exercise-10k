  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. The program should handle lists of varying lengths and should be able to handle cases where the list is empty.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_max(lst):\n    if len(lst) == 0:\n        return None\n    max_val = lst[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        if lst[i] > max_val:\n            max_val = lst[i]\n    return max_val\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 5, 6, 2, 9, 1]\nprint(find_max(numbers))  # Output: 9\n```\nI've followed the specifications exactly, using a `for` loop to iterate through the list, starting from the second element, and updating the `max_val` variable whenever a larger number is found. The function returns `None` if the input list is empty, and the maximum value otherwise.",
