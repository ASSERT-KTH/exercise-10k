  "prompt": "Create a function called \"calculate_stats\" that takes a list of exam scores as input and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the scores. The function should handle cases where the input list is empty.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates and returns statistical measures from a list of exam scores, handling cases where the input list might be empty. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_stats(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of exam scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of exam scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the scores.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input list is empty\n    if not scores:\n        # If the list is empty, we return a dictionary with all stats set to None\n        return {\n            'mean': None,\n            'median': None,\n            'standard_deviation': None\n        }\n\n    # Next, we calculate the mean of the scores\n    # We use the statistics module's mean function for this\n    mean = statistics.mean(scores)\n\n    # Then, we calculate the median of the scores\n    # We use the statistics module's median function for this\n    median = statistics.median(scores)\n\n    # Finally, we calculate the standard deviation of the scores\n    # We use the statistics module's stdev function for this\n    # This function will raise a StatisticsError if the list has less than 2 elements\n    # So, we need to handle this case\n    if len(scores) < 2:\n        std_dev = None\n    else:\n        std_dev = statistics.stdev(scores)\n\n    # Now, we create a dictionary to store our results\n    stats = {\n        # The mean of the scores\n        'mean': mean,\n        # The median of the scores\n        'median': median,\n        # The standard deviation of the scores\n        'standard_deviation': std_dev\n    }\n\n    # Finally, we return the dictionary\n    return stats\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_stats` first checks if the input list `scores` is empty. If it is, the function returns a dictionary with all statistics set to `None`.\n* It then calculates the `mean`, `median`, and `standard_deviation` of the scores using the `statistics` module's `mean`, `median`, and `stdev` functions, respectively.\n* For the `standard_deviation`, it handles the case where the list has less than 2 elements by setting `std_dev` to `None`, as the `stdev` function would otherwise raise a `StatisticsError`.\n* Finally, the function returns a dictionary `stats` containing the calculated `mean`, `median`, and `standard_deviation`.",
