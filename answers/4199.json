  "answer": "**Tic Tac Toe Game Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in Python.\n\n### Game Description\n\nTic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\n# Tic Tac Toe game in Python\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize the game board\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the current state of the game board.\n    \"\"\"\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef has_won(player):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given player has won the game.\n\n    Args:\n        player (str): The player to check for (either 'X' or 'O').\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the player has won, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] == player:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_draw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the game is a draw (i.e., all squares are filled and no player has won).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the game is a draw, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ' ' not in board and not has_won('X') and not has_won('O')\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        if has_won(current_player):\n            print_board()\n            print(\"Player {} wins! Congratulations!\".format(current_player))\n            break\n        elif is_draw():\n            print_board()\n            print(\"It's a draw!\")\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the game, simply execute the `main` function. The game will prompt each player for their move, and the game will continue until either a player wins or the game is a draw.\n\n1. Run the game by executing the `main` function.\n2. Player 'X' is prompted to enter their move (1-9).\n3. Enter a valid move (e.g., 5).\n4. The game board is updated, and Player 'O' is prompted to enter their move.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the game is won or a draw.\n\nNote: The game board is 1-indexed, meaning the top-left square is 1 and the bottom-right square is 9.",
