  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the compound interest on an investment given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): The initial amount of money\n    - rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form)\n    - time (int): The time period of the investment (in years)\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The final amount of money after compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the compound interest using the formula: A = P * (1 + r)^t\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate) ** time\n    \n    # Calculate the compound interest by subtracting the principal\n    interest = amount - principal\n    \n    return amount, interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100  # Convert to decimal\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    amount, interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Principal amount: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest rate: {rate*100:.2f}%\")\n    print(f\"Time period: {time} years\")\n    print(f\"Final amount: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n*   The program starts by defining a function called `calculate_compound_interest()` that takes three parameters: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.\n*   Inside this function, it calculates the final amount of money after compound interest using the formula `A = P * (1 + r)^t`, where `A` is the amount, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.\n*   The compound interest is then calculated by subtracting the principal amount from the final amount.\n*   In the `main()` function, the program prompts the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n*   It then calls the `calculate_compound_interest()` function with these values and prints the result, including the final amount and the compound interest.\n*   The program uses the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.",
