  "prompt": "Write a program that allows two players to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the players' choices as input and print the winner.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_player_choice(player_name):\n    \"\"\"Get the choice of a player.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        choice = input(f\"{player_name}, enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): \").strip().capitalize()\n        if choice in [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]:\n            return choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the players' choices.\"\"\"\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player1_choice == \"Rock\" and player2_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"Scissors\" and player2_choice == \"Paper\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"Paper\" and player2_choice == \"Rock\"):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    player1_name = input(\"Enter Player 1's name: \")\n    player2_name = input(\"Enter Player 2's name: \")\n    \n    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name)\n    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name)\n    \n    print(f\"\\n{player1_name} chose: {player1_choice}\")\n    print(f\"{player2_name} chose: {player2_choice}\\n\")\n    \n    print(determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define two helper functions: `get_player_choice` to get the choice of a player and `determine_winner` to determine the winner based on the players' choices. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, where we get the names of the two players, their choices, and then print the winner.\n\nTo run this program, save it in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py` and run it using `python rock_paper_scissors.py`. Follow the prompts to play the game.",
