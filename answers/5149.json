  "answer": "### Finding the Oldest Student in a Dictionary\n\nTo find the oldest student in a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages, you can use the built-in `max` function with a custom key.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_oldest_student(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the oldest student in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the name and age of the oldest student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not students:\n        return None\n\n    oldest_student = max(students, key=students.get)\n    return oldest_student, students[oldest_student]\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 19,\n    \"Charlie\": 25\n}\n\noldest = find_oldest_student(students)\nif oldest:\n    print(f\"The oldest student is {oldest[0]} with an age of {oldest[1]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No students found.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `find_oldest_student` function takes a dictionary `students` as input and returns a tuple containing the name and age of the oldest student.\n*   If the dictionary is empty, the function returns `None`.\n*   The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `students.get` is used to find the key (student name) with the maximum value (age).\n*   The age of the oldest student is retrieved from the dictionary using the `oldest_student` key.\n*   The function returns a tuple containing the name and age of the oldest student.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n\nIn the example usage, we define a dictionary `students` with four students and their corresponding ages. We call the `find_oldest_student` function with this dictionary and print the result. The output will be:\n\n```\nThe oldest student is Charlie with an age of 25\n```",
