  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a password as input from the user and checks if it meets the following criteria:\n\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n* The password must contain at least one digit.\n* The password must contain at least one special character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a password against the following criteria:\n    - At least 8 characters long\n    - At least one uppercase letter\n    - At least one lowercase letter\n    - At least one digit\n    - At least one special character\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the regular expression patterns\n    patterns = {\n        \"uppercase\": r\"[A-Z]\",\n        \"lowercase\": r\"[a-z]\",\n        \"digit\": r\"\\d\",\n        \"special_char\": r\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\"\n    }\n\n    # Check the length of the password\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check each pattern\n    for pattern in patterns.values():\n        if not re.search(pattern, password):\n            return False\n\n    # If all checks pass, the password is valid\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the password from the user\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n\n    # Validate the password\n    if validate_password(password):\n        print(\"Password is valid\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is not valid. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:\")\n        print(\"* At least 8 characters long\")\n        print(\"* At least one uppercase letter\")\n        print(\"* At least one lowercase letter\")\n        print(\"* At least one digit\")\n        print(\"* At least one special character\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter a valid password, such as `P@ssw0rd`.\n* Run the program and enter an invalid password, such as `password`.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses regular expressions to check for the presence of specific character types in the password.\n* The `validate_password` function returns `True` if the password is valid and `False` otherwise.\n* The `main` function gets the password from the user, validates it, and prints a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.",
