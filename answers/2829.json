  "prompt": "Develop a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a person's weight and height. If the BMI is below 18.5, the person is underweight. If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the person is normal weight. If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the person is overweight. If the BMI is above 30, the person is obese.",
  "answer": "**Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. It then categorizes the person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the calculated BMI.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.\n\n    Args:\n    weight (float): Weight in kilograms (kg)\n    height (float): Height in meters (m)\n\n    Returns:\n    float: Calculated BMI\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef categorize_bmi(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Categorize the person based on the calculated BMI.\n\n    Args:\n    bmi (float): Calculated BMI\n\n    Returns:\n    str: Category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese)\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal Weight\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kilograms (kg): \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters (m): \"))\n\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n    # Categorize BMI\n    category = categorize_bmi(bmi)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your category is: {category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* A person with a weight of 70 kg and a height of 1.75 m:\n\t+ BMI: 22.86\n\t+ Category: Normal Weight\n* A person with a weight of 90 kg and a height of 1.65 m:\n\t+ BMI: 33.17\n\t+ Category: Obese\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `bmi_calculator.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python: `python bmi_calculator.py`.\n3. Follow the prompts to enter your weight and height.\n4. The program will calculate and display your BMI and category.",
