  "answer": "Here's a Python program that takes two octal numbers as input and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef octal_to_decimal(octal):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an octal number to decimal.\n\n    Args:\n        octal (str): The octal number to convert.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The decimal equivalent of the octal number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return int(octal, 8)\n\ndef decimal_to_octal(decimal):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a decimal number to octal.\n\n    Args:\n        decimal (int): The decimal number to convert.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The octal equivalent of the decimal number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return oct(decimal)[2:]\n\ndef add_octal_numbers(octal1, octal2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two octal numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        octal1 (str): The first octal number.\n        octal2 (str): The second octal number.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The sum of the two octal numbers in octal.\n    \"\"\"\n    decimal_sum = octal_to_decimal(octal1) + octal_to_decimal(octal2)\n    return decimal_to_octal(decimal_sum)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two octal numbers from the user\n    octal1 = input(\"Enter the first octal number: \")\n    octal2 = input(\"Enter the second octal number: \")\n\n    # Add the two octal numbers\n    sum_octal = add_octal_numbers(octal1, octal2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The sum of {octal1} and {octal2} is {sum_octal}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program works by first converting the input octal numbers to decimal, adding them together, and then converting the result back to octal.\n\n1. **Input**: The program starts by asking the user to input two octal numbers.\n2. **Octal to Decimal Conversion**: The `octal_to_decimal` function converts an octal number to decimal using Python's built-in `int` function with base 8.\n3. **Decimal Addition**: The `add_octal_numbers` function adds the two decimal numbers together.\n4. **Decimal to Octal Conversion**: The `decimal_to_octal` function converts the decimal sum back to octal using Python's built-in `oct` function.\n5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the addition in octal.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Adding two simple octal numbers: `12` and `3`\n* Adding two larger octal numbers: `123` and `456`\n* Adding two octal numbers with leading zeros: `012` and `03`",
