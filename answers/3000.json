  "answer": "**Longest Palindromic Substring Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program uses a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome, and then checks all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest palindromic substring.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a string is a palindrome.\"\"\"\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\n\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Find the longest palindromic substring of a given string.\"\"\"\n    longest = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if is_palindrome(substring) and len(substring) > len(longest):\n                longest = substring\n    return longest\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = \"babad\"\n    print(\"Longest palindromic substring of '{}' is '{}'\".format(\n        input_string, longest_palindromic_substring(input_string)))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `is_palindrome` function checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n2. The `longest_palindromic_substring` function iterates over all possible substrings of the input string.\n3. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.\n4. If the substring is a palindrome and its length is greater than the current longest palindromic substring, it updates the longest palindromic substring.\n5. The function returns the longest palindromic substring found.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the `is_palindrome` function has a time complexity of O(n), and it is called for each substring, which is O(n^2).\n\n**Optimization**\n--------------\n\nTo improve the performance of this program, you can use a more efficient algorithm, such as the Manacher's algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n). However, this algorithm is more complex and may be overkill for small input strings.",
