  "prompt": "Create a function called calculate_grade that takes in a student's score as an integer and returns their corresponding grade as a string. The grade is determined by the following ranges: 90-100 (A), 80-89 (B), 70-79 (C), 60-69 (D), and below 60 (F).",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that determines a student's grade based on their score. This function will take an integer score as input and return the corresponding grade as a string. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the score is within the valid range (0-100)\n    if not 0 <= score <= 100:\n        return \"Invalid score\"\n\n    # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    \n    # If the score is not A, we check if it's B (80-89)\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    \n    # If the score is not A or B, we check if it's C (70-79)\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    \n    # If the score is not A, B, or C, we check if it's D (60-69)\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    \n    # If the score is none of the above, it must be F (below 60)\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_grade(95))  # Output: A\nprint(calculate_grade(85))  # Output: B\nprint(calculate_grade(75))  # Output: C\nprint(calculate_grade(65))  # Output: D\nprint(calculate_grade(55))  # Output: F\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_grade` function first checks if the input `score` is within the valid range of 0 to 100. If not, it returns an \"Invalid score\" message.\n* It then uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the `score`. For example, if the `score` is 90 or above, it returns \"A\".\n* The function continues to check the `score` against the grade ranges in descending order, returning the corresponding grade as a string.\n* If the `score` doesn't match any of the specified ranges, it defaults to returning \"F\".",
