  "answer": "**Final Grade Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the final grade given a list of scores and their respective weights. It takes into account the score and weight of each assignment, and returns the weighted average of all scores.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_final_grade(scores, weights):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the final grade given a list of scores and their respective weights.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of scores.\n        weights (list): A list of weights corresponding to each score.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The final grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(scores) != len(weights):\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of scores and weights must be equal.\")\n\n    total_score = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    for score, weight in zip(scores, weights):\n        total_score += score * weight\n        total_weight += weight\n\n    if total_weight == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The total weight cannot be zero.\")\n\n    final_grade = total_score / total_weight\n    return final_grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    scores = [90, 80, 70, 95]\n    weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4]\n\n    try:\n        final_grade = calculate_final_grade(scores, weights)\n        print(f\"Final Grade: {final_grade:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_final_grade` function takes two lists as input: `scores` and `weights`.\n2. It checks if the number of scores and weights are equal. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It initializes two variables: `total_score` and `total_weight`, to keep track of the sum of weighted scores and the sum of weights, respectively.\n4. It iterates over the `scores` and `weights` lists using the `zip` function, which allows it to iterate over two lists in parallel.\n5. For each score and weight, it adds the weighted score to `total_score` and the weight to `total_weight`.\n6. It checks if the total weight is zero. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`, because dividing by zero is undefined.\n7. Finally, it calculates the final grade by dividing the total score by the total weight, and returns the result.\n8. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_final_grade` function with example scores and weights.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the final grade for a student in a course with multiple assignments.\n* Evaluating the performance of a team or project based on multiple metrics.\n* Determining the overall score of a product or service based on customer reviews and ratings.",
