  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user, checks if it's a palindrome, and then reverses the string. If the string is a palindrome, print 'The string is a palindrome' before printing the reversed string. Otherwise, just print the reversed string.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ns = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nif s == s[::-1]:\n    print(\"The string is a palindrome\")\nprint(s[::-1])\n```\nThis code takes a string input from the user, checks if it's a palindrome, and then reverses the string. If the string is a palindrome, it prints a message indicating that, followed by the reversed string. If the string is not a palindrome, it simply prints the reversed string.",
