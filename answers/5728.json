  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nHere's a simple Python function that generates a random number and lets the user guess it.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_random_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_random_number()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `guess_random_number` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. The function then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the function reveals the correct answer and exits.\n4. If the user enters a non-integer value, the function displays an error message and continues to the next iteration.\n5. If the user's guess is too low or too high, the function provides a hint and continues to the next iteration.\n6. If the user's guess is correct, the function congratulates the user and exits.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `guessing_game.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python guessing_game.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
