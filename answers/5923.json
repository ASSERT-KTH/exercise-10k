  "prompt": "Write a program that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user should be able to input their choice, and the program should generate a random choice and determine the winner.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    \n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n    print(f\"You chose: {user_choice}\\n\")\n    \n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`get_computer_choice` function**: Generates the computer's random choice.\n2. **`determine_winner` function**: Determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\n3. **`main` function**: Gets the user's choice, generates the computer's choice, and determines the winner.\n4. **Input validation**: Ensures the user enters a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors).\n5. **Gameplay**: The program prints out the computer's choice, the user's choice, and the result of the game.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program, enter your choice when prompted, and the program will generate the computer's choice and determine the winner. For example:\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nComputer chose: scissors\nYou chose: rock\n\nYou win!\n```",
