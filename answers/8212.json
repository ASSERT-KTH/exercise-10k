  "answer": "**Grade Checker Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks a student's grade based on their score using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef check_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Check if the score is valid\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Check the student's grade\n        grade = check_grade(score)\n        print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The function uses if/else statements to check the score and return the grade.\n3. The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, checks if it's valid, and then calls the `check_grade` function to get the student's grade.\n4. The program prints the student's grade to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n* Enter a score of 82 to get a grade of B.\n* Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n* Enter a score of 62 to get a grade of D.\n* Enter a score of 40 to get a grade of F.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file called `grade_checker.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python grade_checker.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the student's score and get their grade.",
