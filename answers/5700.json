  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it's a palindrome using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if a given string is a palindrome using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    s = s.lower()  # Convert to lowercase\n    reversed_s = s[::-1]  # Reverse the string\n\n    if s == reversed_s:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\ns = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nif is_palindrome(s):\n    print(f\"'{s}' is a palindrome.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{s}' is not a palindrome.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string `s` as input, converts it to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, and then checks if the string is equal to its reverse. If they are equal, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nIn the main part of the program, the user is prompted to enter a string, and the `is_palindrome` function is called with this string. Depending on the result, a message is printed indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n- Input: \"madam\" - Output: \"'madam' is a palindrome.\"\n- Input: \"hello\" - Output: \"'hello' is not a palindrome.\"\n- Input: \"Aibohphobia\" - Output: \"'Aibohphobia' is a palindrome.\"",
