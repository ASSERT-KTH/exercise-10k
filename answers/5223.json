  "prompt": "Write a program that allows two players to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should take the choices of both players as input and print the winner.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program to simulate a Rock, Paper, Scissors game between two players:\n\n```python\ndef rock_paper_scissors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate a Rock, Paper, Scissors game between two players.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding indices\n    choices = {\n        \"rock\": 0,\n        \"paper\": 1,\n        \"scissors\": 2\n    }\n\n    # Get the choices of both players\n    player1_choice = input(\"Player 1, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    player2_choice = input(\"Player 2, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n\n    # Check if the choices are valid\n    if player1_choice not in choices or player2_choice not in choices:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n        return rock_paper_scissors()\n\n    # Determine the winner based on the game's rules\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n    elif (player1_choice == \"rock\" and player2_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"paper\" and player2_choice == \"rock\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"scissors\" and player2_choice == \"paper\"):\n        print(\"Player 1 wins!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Player 2 wins!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    rock_paper_scissors()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Game Logic**: The game's logic is implemented using a simple if-else statement that checks for ties and winning conditions based on the game's rules.\n2. **Input Validation**: The program validates the inputs provided by the players to ensure they are one of the allowed choices (rock, paper, or scissors).\n3. **Recursion**: If an invalid choice is detected, the program calls itself recursively to prompt the players for their choices again.\n4. **User Interaction**: The program uses the built-in `input` function to get the choices from the players and prints the result to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* **Tie**: If both players choose the same option (e.g., rock), the program will print \"It's a tie!\".\n* **Player 1 Wins**: If Player 1 chooses rock and Player 2 chooses scissors, the program will print \"Player 1 wins!\".\n* **Player 2 Wins**: If Player 1 chooses rock and Player 2 chooses paper, the program will print \"Player 2 wins!\".",
