  "answer": "**Email Validation Function**\n================================\n\nThe following Python function validates an email address based on its format and characters. It uses a regular expression to check for the correct format and ensures that the email address does not contain any invalid characters.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a given email address based on its format and characters.\n\n    Args:\n        email (str): The email address to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Regular expression for validating an email address\n    email_regex = r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"\n\n    # Check if the email matches the regular expression\n    if re.match(email_regex, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\nemail1 = \"test@example.com\"\nemail2 = \"invalid_email\"\n\nprint(f\"Email '{email1}' is valid: {validate_email(email1)}\")\nprint(f\"Email '{email2}' is valid: {validate_email(email2)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   The `validate_email` function takes an email address as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the email is valid or not.\n*   The regular expression `email_regex` checks for the following rules:\n    *   `^` asserts the start of the line.\n    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens.\n    *   `@` matches the @ symbol.\n    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens.\n    *   `\\.` matches a dot.\n    *   `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches the domain extension (it must be at least 2 characters long).\n    *   `$` asserts the end of the line.\n*   The `re.match` function checks if the email address matches the regular expression. If it does, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\n**Email Format Rules**\n----------------------\n\n*   The local part of the email (before the @ symbol) can contain alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens.\n*   The domain name (after the @ symbol) can contain alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens.\n*   The domain extension (after the last dot) must be at least 2 characters long.\n\nBy following these rules and using the provided regular expression, you can effectively validate email addresses in your application.",
