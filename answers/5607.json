  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it, providing hints (e.g. 'too high', 'too low') until the user guesses correctly.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the player has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the player for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the player has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number to guess\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You've guessed the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n1. **Generate a Random Number**: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. **Initialize Tries**: The program initializes a variable `tries` to keep track of how many attempts the user has made to guess the number.\n3. **Game Loop**: The program enters a loop where it continuously asks the user for their guess until they either guess the number correctly or type 'quit' to exit the game.\n4. **Validate User Input**: The program checks if the user's input is a valid integer. If not, it prompts the user to enter a valid number.\n5. **Provide Hints**: If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program provides a corresponding hint.\n6. **Win Condition**: If the user guesses the number correctly, the program congratulates the user and ends the game, displaying the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.",
