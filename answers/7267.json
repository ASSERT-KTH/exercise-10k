  "prompt": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence common to both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, given the sequences 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA', the longest common subsequence is 'BCBA' and its length is 4. Your task is to write a function that takes two sequences as input and returns the length of their longest common subsequence.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through a solution to find the length of the longest subsequence common to two given sequences. This will involve creating a function that takes two sequences as input and returns the length of their longest common subsequence.\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n* Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences.\n* Iterate over the characters in both sequences, comparing each pair of characters and updating the 2D array accordingly.\n* Use the 2D array to determine the length of the longest common subsequence.\n* Return the length of the longest common subsequence as the result.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the length of the longest subsequence common to two sequences.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    seq1 (str): The first sequence.\n    seq2 (str): The second sequence.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    # The array has (len(seq1) + 1) rows and (len(seq2) + 1) columns\n    lengths = [[0] * (len(seq2) + 1) for _ in range(len(seq1) + 1)]\n\n    # Iterate over the rows of the array\n    for i in range(1, len(seq1) + 1):\n        # Iterate over the columns of the array\n        for j in range(1, len(seq2) + 1):\n            # If the current characters in the sequences are the same, \n            # the length of the common subsequence is one more than the length of the subsequence without these characters\n            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:\n                lengths[i][j] = lengths[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            # If the current characters are different, the length of the common subsequence is the maximum length of the subsequences without the current characters\n            else:\n                lengths[i][j] = max(lengths[i - 1][j], lengths[i][j - 1])\n\n    # The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the array\n    return lengths[-1][-1]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(longest_common_subsequence('ABCBDAB', 'BDCABA'))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nHere's a concise explanation of the code:\n* We create a 2D array `lengths` with dimensions `(len(seq1) + 1) x (len(seq2) + 1)` to store the lengths of common subsequences. The extra row and column are for handling edge cases where one of the sequences is empty.\n* We iterate over the characters in both sequences using nested loops. If the current characters `seq1[i - 1]` and `seq2[j - 1]` are the same, we increment the length of the common subsequence by 1. Otherwise, we take the maximum length of the subsequences without the current characters.\n* The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the `lengths` array, which is returned as the result.\n* The function is tested with the example sequences 'ABCBDAB' and 'BDCABA', and it correctly returns the length of their longest common subsequence, which is 4.",
