  "answer": "**Chatbot Program**\n======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program creates a simple chatbot that responds to user input with pre-defined responses. The chatbot uses a dictionary to store the responses, where each key is a user input and the corresponding value is the chatbot's response.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with pre-defined responses\nresponses = {\n    \"hello\": [\"Hi, how are you?\", \"Hello! How can I assist you?\", \"Hi, what's up?\"],\n    \"how are you\": [\"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\", \"I'm good, thanks!\", \"I'm just a chatbot, I don't have feelings.\"],\n    \"what is your name\": [\"My name is Chatbot\", \"I'm an AI chatbot\", \"You can call me CB\"],\n    \"default\": [\"I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?\", \"Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.\", \"Can you please provide more context?\"]\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a response based on the user's input.\n\n    Args:\n    user_input (str): The user's input.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The chatbot's response.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the user's input to lowercase\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n\n    # Check if the user's input is in the responses dictionary\n    if user_input in responses:\n        # Return a random response from the list of responses\n        return random.choice(responses[user_input])\n    else:\n        # Return a default response if the user's input is not recognized\n        return random.choice(responses[\"default\"])\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.\")\n    while True:\n        # Get the user's input\n        user_input = input(\"User: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_input.lower() == \"quit\":\n            break\n\n        # Get the chatbot's response\n        response = get_response(user_input)\n\n        # Print the chatbot's response\n        print(\"Chatbot:\", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* User: `hello`\nChatbot: `Hi, how are you?`\n* User: `how are you`\nChatbot: `I'm doing great, thanks for asking!`\n* User: `what is your name`\nChatbot: `My name is Chatbot`\n* User: `foo`\nChatbot: `I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?`\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can add more responses to the `responses` dictionary to make the chatbot more conversational.\n* You can use natural language processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy to improve the chatbot's understanding of user input.\n* You can integrate the chatbot with other services, such as databases or APIs, to provide more accurate and helpful responses.",
