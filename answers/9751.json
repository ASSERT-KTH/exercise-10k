  "answer": "**Deposit Interest Calculator**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the interest earned on a deposit based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\ndef calculate_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the interest earned on a deposit.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial deposit amount.\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04).\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The interest earned.\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Deposit Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display interest\n    interest = calculate_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    print(f\"Interest earned: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total amount after {time} years: ${principal + interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program defines a function `calculate_interest` that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as arguments.\n2. The function calculates the interest earned using the formula: `interest = principal * rate * time`.\n3. In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to input the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n4. The program then calls the `calculate_interest` function with the user-input values and displays the interest earned and the total amount after the specified time period.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n* Run the program and enter the following values:\n\t+ Principal amount: $1000\n\t+ Annual interest rate: 4%\n\t+ Time period: 5 years\n* The program will display the interest earned and the total amount after 5 years:\n\t+ Interest earned: $200.00\n\t+ Total amount after 5 years: $1200.00",
