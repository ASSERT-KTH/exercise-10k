  "answer": "**Checking if Two Strings are Permutations of Each Other**\n\nTo check if two strings are permutations of each other, we can use the following approach:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check if both strings have the same length**: If they don't, they cannot be permutations of each other.\n2. **Sort both strings**: If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings are permutations of each other.\n\n### Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef are_permutations(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two strings are permutations of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are permutations of each other, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort both strings and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(are_permutations(\"listen\", \"silent\"))  # True\nprint(are_permutations(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the strings.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nWe can also use a hash table to count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the resulting dictionaries. This approach has a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Code (Python) - Alternative Approach\n\n```python\ndef are_permutations(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two strings are permutations of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are permutations of each other, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Create dictionaries to count character frequencies\n    count1 = {}\n    count2 = {}\n\n    # Count character frequencies\n    for char in str1:\n        count1[char] = count1.get(char, 0) + 1\n    for char in str2:\n        count2[char] = count2.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    # Compare dictionaries\n    return count1 == count2\n\n# Example usage\nprint(are_permutations(\"listen\", \"silent\"))  # True\nprint(are_permutations(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Using Python's Built-in `Counter` Class\n\nWe can also use Python's built-in `Counter` class from the `collections` module to simplify the code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef are_permutations(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two strings are permutations of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are permutations of each other, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Compare character frequencies using Counter\n    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(are_permutations(\"listen\", \"silent\"))  # True\nprint(are_permutations(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # False\n```",
