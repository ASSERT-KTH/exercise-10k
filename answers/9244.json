  "answer": "**Example Program: Calculating the Area of a Rectangle**\n\n### Description\nThis program defines a function `calculate_area` that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area. The function is then called with example values to demonstrate its usage.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define the function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n# Main program\ndef main():\n    # Define example values\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n\n    # Call the function and store the result\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area:.2f} square units\")\n\n# Run the main program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns their product.\n2. The `main` function defines example values for the length and width of a rectangle.\n3. The `calculate_area` function is called with these example values, and the result is stored in the `area` variable.\n4. The result is then printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Program\nSave this code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rectangle_area.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python rectangle_area.py`). The program will output the area of the rectangle with the given dimensions.",
