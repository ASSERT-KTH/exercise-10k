  "prompt": "Write a function to reverse the order of elements in an array. The function should take an array as input and return the reversed array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef reverse_elements(arr):\n    arr = arr[::-1]\n    return arr\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(reverse_elements(arr))\n```\nThis code defines a function `reverse_elements` that takes an array as input, reverses its order using slicing, and returns the reversed array. The example usage at the end creates an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, passes it to the `reverse_elements` function, and prints the result, which is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.",
