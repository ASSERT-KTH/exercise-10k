  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among all the strings.\n\n**Algorithm**\n-------------\n\nThe algorithm works by comparing the characters at the same position in each string. If all characters at the current position are the same, it adds the character to the common prefix. If not, it stops and returns the common prefix found so far.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix among a given list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"hello world\", \"hello python\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"hello\"\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty string.\n2. We find the shortest string in the list, because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. We iterate over each character in the shortest string.\n4. For each character, we check if the character at the same position in all other strings is the same. If it's not, we return the common prefix found so far.\n5. If we reach the end of the shortest string without finding a mismatch, we return the entire shortest string as the common prefix.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the input list. This is because we iterate over each character in the shortest string and compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.",
