  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the code.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you to guess it.\n3. Type your guess and press Enter.\n4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `random.randint(a, b)` function generates a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`.\n* The `input()` function returns a string, so we need to use `int()` to convert the user's guess to an integer.\n* The `try`/`except` block is used to catch any `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `number_guessing_game()` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.",
