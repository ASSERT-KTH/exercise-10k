  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a function written in Python that checks if a given number is prime.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a prime number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"Is {num} a prime number? {is_prime(num)}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2.  If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number, so the function returns `False`.\n3.  The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`.\n4.  If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.\n\n**Optimization:**\n\n*   The loop only goes up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.\n*   This optimization significantly reduces the number of iterations for larger numbers.",
