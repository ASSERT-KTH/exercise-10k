  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade of a student from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for grade in grades:\n        total += grade\n    return total / len(grades)\n\n\ndef main():\n    grades = [90, 80, 70, 95, 85]\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    print(f\"The average grade is: {average_grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `calculate_average_grade` function takes a list of grades as input, initializes a variable `total` to 0, and then uses a for loop to iterate over the list of grades, adding each grade to the `total`. Finally, it returns the average grade by dividing the `total` by the number of grades.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_grade` function by passing a list of grades to it and printing the result.\n\nYou can replace the list of grades in the `main` function with your own list of grades to calculate the average grade.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the list of grades is not empty. If the list is empty, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. You may want to add error handling to handle this case. For example:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    if not grades:\n        return None\n    total = 0\n    for grade in grades:\n        total += grade\n    return total / len(grades)\n```",
