  "answer": "**Calculating Distance Between Two Points**\n==============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space. It takes the coordinates of the two points as input and returns the distance between them.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x, y) or (x, y, z)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x, y) or (x, y, z)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both points have the same number of coordinates\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of coordinates\")\n\n    # Calculate the squared differences between corresponding coordinates\n    squared_differences = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n\n    # Calculate the Euclidean distance using the Pythagorean theorem\n    distance = math.sqrt(sum(squared_differences))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {calculate_distance(point1, point2)}\")\n\n    point3 = (1, 2, 3)\n    point4 = (4, 5, 6)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point3} and {point4} is {calculate_distance(point3, point4)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, as input, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It checks if both points have the same number of coordinates and raises a `ValueError` if they do not.\n3. It calculates the squared differences between corresponding coordinates using a list comprehension.\n4. It calculates the Euclidean distance using the Pythagorean theorem, which is the square root of the sum of the squared differences.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function to calculate the distance between two points in 2D and 3D space.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the input coordinates are valid numbers.\n* The `calculate_distance` function can handle points with any number of coordinates, as long as both points have the same number of coordinates.",
