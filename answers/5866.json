  "answer": "**Finding the Index of an Element in a List**\n\nYou can use the `index()` method in Python to find the index of a specific element in a given list.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a specific element in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search in.\n        element: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(element)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nelement = 3\nindex = find_index(my_list, element)\n\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"The element {element} is at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The element {element} is not in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Define a function `find_index()` that takes a list `lst` and an element as arguments.\n2. Use the `index()` method to find the index of the element in the list.\n3. If the element is found, return its index.\n4. If the element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised. Catch this exception and return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n\n### Note\n\n* The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the list. If the element appears multiple times in the list, you may need to use a different approach to find all occurrences.\n* This code assumes that the list does not contain duplicate elements. If the list can contain duplicates, you may need to use a different approach to find all occurrences of the element.",
