  "prompt": "Create a program that prints out a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, where n is provided by the user. The program should use a loop to print out the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nusing System;\n\nclass PrintNumberSequence\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `System` namespace, defines a `PrintNumberSequence` class with a `Main` method, reads an integer `n` from the console, and uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to `n`.",
