We initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of each array.\n2. We compare the elements at the current positions of `arr1` and `arr2`. If `arr1[i]` is smaller, we append it to the `result` array and increment `i`. Otherwise, we append `arr2[j]` and increment `j`.\n3. We repeat this process until we reach the end of one of the arrays.\n4. Finally, we append any remaining elements from the other array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because we are scanning each array exactly once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because we are storing all elements from both arrays in the `result` array.",
