  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it prints whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(f\"The number was {number_to_guess}. Better luck next time!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess, and the program will tell you if it's higher or lower than the actual number.\n4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n5. To quit the game, type \"quit\" at any time.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or choose to quit. It also includes input validation to ensure that the user's guess is a valid integer between 1 and 100.",
