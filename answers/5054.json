  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\nThis program checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks whether a given number is prime or not.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's prime, `False` otherwise.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n3. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`, so we use a loop that iterates from 2 to `sqrt(n)`.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime, so we return `False`.\n5. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, so we return `True`.\n6. In the `main` function, we ask the user to input a number and then call `is_prime` to check if it's prime.\n7. We print out the result, indicating whether the number is prime or not.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Input: `25`\n  Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23`\n  Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `1`\n  Output: `1 is not a prime number.`\n\nNote: This program uses a trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized numbers. For larger numbers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.",
