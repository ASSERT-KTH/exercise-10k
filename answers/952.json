This ensures that the product is calculated correctly.\n*   We use a `while` loop to iterate through the list of numbers. The loop continues as long as the `index` is less than the length of the list.\n*   Inside the loop, we multiply the current `product` by the current number at the `index` position in the list.\n*   After each iteration, we increment the `index` to move to the next number in the list.\n*   Once the loop completes, we return the final `product`, which is the result of multiplying all the numbers in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we iterate through the list once using the `while` loop.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input list, making it efficient for large lists.",
