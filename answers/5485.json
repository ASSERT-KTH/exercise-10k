  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the average grade of a student given their grades in different subjects:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of a student given their grades in different subjects.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n    average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n    return average_grade\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of subjects\n    num_subjects = int(input(\"Enter the number of subjects: \"))\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the grades\n    grades = {}\n\n    # Get the grades for each subject\n    for i in range(num_subjects):\n        subject = input(f\"Enter the name of subject {i+1}: \")\n        grade = float(input(f\"Enter the grade for {subject}: \"))\n        grades[subject] = grade\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n\n    # Print the average grade\n    print(f\"The average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function takes a dictionary of grades as input, where the keys are the subject names and the values are the grades.\n2. It calculates the total grade by summing up all the values in the dictionary using the `sum` function.\n3. It calculates the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of subjects, which is obtained using the `len` function.\n4. The `main` function asks the user to enter the number of subjects and the grades for each subject.\n5. It stores the grades in a dictionary and passes it to the `calculate_average_grade` function to calculate the average grade.\n6. Finally, it prints the average grade with two decimal places using the `print` function with a format specifier.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If a student has grades of 80 in Math, 90 in Science, and 70 in English, the program will calculate the average grade as (80 + 90 + 70) / 3 = 80.0.\n* If a student has grades of 95 in History, 85 in Geography, and 75 in Language, the program will calculate the average grade as (95 + 85 + 75) / 3 = 85.0.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the grades are numerical values between 0 and 100. If the grades are letter grades (e.g., A, B, C), you will need to modify the program to handle them accordingly.",
