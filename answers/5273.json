  "answer": "**Password Validation Program**\n================================\n\nThis program validates a password based on its length and content. It checks if the password meets the following criteria:\n\n* Length: at least 8 characters\n* Content: contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a password based on its length and content.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the password length is at least 8 characters\n    if len(password) < 8:\n        print(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one digit\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one digit.\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the password contains at least one special character\n    if not re.search(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password):\n        print(\"Password must contain at least one special character.\")\n        return False\n\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    validate_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Valid password**: Enter a password that meets all the criteria, such as \"P@ssw0rd123\".\n2. **Invalid password (length)**: Enter a password that is less than 8 characters long, such as \"P@ssw0rd\".\n3. **Invalid password (uppercase letter)**: Enter a password that does not contain an uppercase letter, such as \"p@ssw0rd123\".\n4. **Invalid password (lowercase letter)**: Enter a password that does not contain a lowercase letter, such as \"P@SSW0RD123\".\n5. **Invalid password (digit)**: Enter a password that does not contain a digit, such as \"P@ssword\".\n6. **Invalid password (special character)**: Enter a password that does not contain a special character, such as \"Password123\".\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n* Always use a secure password that meets the criteria mentioned above.\n* Use a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account.\n* Avoid using easily guessable information, such as your name, birthdate, or common words, in your password.\n* Consider using a passphrase, which is a sequence of words that is easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.",
