  "prompt": "Write a program that declares a set 'numbers' and assigns it the values {1, 2, 3}. Then, print the set to the console.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Declare a set 'numbers' and assign it the values {1, 2, 3}\nnumbers = {1, 2, 3}\n\n# Print the set to the console\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output: `{1, 2, 3}`. \n\nNote: Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, so the order of the numbers may not always be the same when printed. However, the output will always contain the numbers 1, 2, and 3.",
