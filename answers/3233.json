  "answer": "**Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array**\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses a two-pointer approach to remove duplicates from a sorted array.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The input list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(arr) == 0:\n        return arr\n\n    write_index = 1\n    for read_index in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[read_index] != arr[read_index - 1]:\n            arr[write_index] = arr[read_index]\n            write_index += 1\n\n    return arr[:write_index]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    print(\"Array without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(arr))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `remove_duplicates` function takes a sorted list `arr` as input.\n2. If the input list is empty, the function returns the list immediately.\n3. We initialize two pointers: `write_index` and `read_index`. `write_index` is used to keep track of the position where the next non-duplicate element should be written, and `read_index` is used to iterate through the list.\n4. We iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 1).\n5. If the current element is different from the previous one, we write it to the position pointed by `write_index` and increment `write_index`.\n6. Finally, we return the list sliced up to `write_index`, which contains the list without duplicates.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we only iterate through the list once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and do not allocate any additional space that scales with the input size.",
