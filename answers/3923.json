  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the division and the remainder.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs the requested operation:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return quotient, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient and remainder. It uses the `//` operator for integer division and the `%` operator to calculate the remainder.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers, calls `divide_numbers` with these inputs, and prints the result. If the user attempts to divide by zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` exception and prints an error message.\n\nPlease note that this program performs integer division, which means it truncates the decimal part of the result. If you want to perform floating-point division, you can use the `/` operator instead.",
