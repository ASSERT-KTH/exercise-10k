  "answer": "**Square Numbers Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input, squares each number, and returns a new list containing the squared values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the squares of each number in the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the squared values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num ** 2 for num in numbers]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)\n    print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the squared values.\n*   The `**` operator is used to square each number.\n*   The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list, leaving the original list unchanged.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This function assumes that the input list only contains numbers. If the input list may contain non-numeric values, you should add error checking code to handle this situation.\n*   You can use this function as a starting point and modify it to fit your specific needs. For example, you could add a check to ensure that the input is a list, or you could use a different method to square the numbers (e.g., using a `for` loop instead of a list comprehension).",
