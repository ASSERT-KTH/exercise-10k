  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a year is a leap year. If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a year is a leap year based on the given conditions:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, \n    or if the year is divisible by 400.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the year is divisible by 4\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        # Check if the year is not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400\n        if year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `is_leap_year` function checks whether a given year is a leap year based on the provided conditions.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `is_leap_year` function with user input.\n*   The program will prompt the user to enter a year and then display whether the entered year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Enter a year when prompted.\n3.  The program will display whether the entered year is a leap year or not.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nHere's a more concise version of the `is_leap_year` function:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, \n    or if the year is divisible by 400.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n```\n\nThis version uses logical operators to combine the conditions into a single expression, making the function more concise.",
