  "answer": "**Writing User Input to a File**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that takes input from the user and writes it to a file.\n\n```python\ndef write_to_file(file_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes user input to a specified file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_name (str): The name of the file to write to.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get user input\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter some text: \")\n\n    try:\n        # Open the file in write mode\n        with open(file_name, \"w\") as file:\n            # Write the user input to the file\n            file.write(user_input)\n        print(f\"Text successfully written to {file_name}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Specify the file name\n    file_name = input(\"Please enter the file name: \")\n\n    # Check if the file name has a .txt extension, if not, add it\n    if not file_name.endswith(\".txt\"):\n        file_name += \".txt\"\n\n    # Call the function to write to the file\n    write_to_file(file_name)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n---------------------------\n\n1. The `write_to_file` function takes a `file_name` parameter, which specifies the name of the file to write to.\n2. The function uses the built-in `input` function to get some text from the user.\n3. It then attempts to open the specified file in write mode (`\"w\"`).\n4. If the file is successfully opened, the function writes the user's input to the file using the `write` method.\n5. If any errors occur during this process, the function catches the exception and prints an error message.\n6. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a file name.\n7. If the file name does not have a `.txt` extension, it is automatically added.\n8. The `write_to_file` function is then called with the specified file name.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a file name (e.g., \"example\").\n3. When prompted again, enter some text (e.g., \"Hello, world!\").\n4. The program will write the text to a file named \"example.txt\" in the same directory as the script.\n\nNote: This program will overwrite any existing file with the same name. If you want to append to an existing file instead, change the `\"w\"` mode to `\"a\"` in the `open` function.",
