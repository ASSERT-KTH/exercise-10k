  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of pairs, where each pair contains one element from each list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two lists into pairs, where each pair contains one element from each list. This function will help you achieve the desired output efficiently. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef pair_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input and returns a list of pairs.\n    Each pair contains one element from each list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of pairs, where each pair contains one element from each list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Calculate the minimum length between the two lists\n    # This is to avoid index out of range error when one list is longer than the other\n    min_length = min(len(list1), len(list2))\n\n    # Iterate over the range of the minimum length\n    for i in range(min_length):\n        # For each iteration, create a pair with one element from each list\n        pair = (list1[i], list2[i])\n        \n        # Append the pair to the pairs list\n        pairs.append(pair)\n\n    # Return the list of pairs\n    return pairs\n\n# Test the function\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nprint(pair_lists(list1, list2))  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `pair_lists` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and initializes an empty list `pairs` to store the resulting pairs.\n*   It calculates the minimum length between `list1` and `list2` using the `min` function to avoid index out of range errors when one list is longer than the other.\n*   The function then iterates over the range of the minimum length, creating pairs with one element from each list using tuple notation `(list1[i], list2[i])`, and appends these pairs to the `pairs` list.\n*   Finally, it returns the `pairs` list containing the combined pairs from both input lists.",
