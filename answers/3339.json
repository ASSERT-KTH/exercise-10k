  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy a given condition, using a lambda function.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\neven_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]))\nprint(even_numbers)\n```\nThis code creates a list `even_numbers` by filtering the list of numbers from 1 to 15 using a lambda function that checks if a number is even (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). The resulting list of even numbers is then printed to the console.",
