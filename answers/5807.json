  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Using While Loop**\n\nBelow is an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` because prime numbers are greater than 1.\n3. It then initializes a counter `i` to 2, which is the smallest prime number.\n4. The `while` loop checks if `i` squared is less than or equal to `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n5. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` by checking if the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is 0. If it is, `n` is not a prime number, so it returns `False`.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is a prime number, so it returns `True`.\n7. The `main` function asks the user to input a number, checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a number, such as 25.\n* The program will output: \"25 is not a prime number.\"\n* Run the program again and enter a prime number, such as 23.\n* The program will output: \"23 is a prime number.\"",
