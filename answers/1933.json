  "prompt": "Write a program that declares a complex number variable and prints its real and imaginary parts.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that declares a complex number variable and prints its real and imaginary parts:\n\n```python\n# Declare a complex number variable\ncomplex_number = 3 + 4j\n\n# Print the complex number\nprint(\"Complex Number: \", complex_number)\n\n# Print the real part of the complex number\nprint(\"Real Part: \", complex_number.real)\n\n# Print the imaginary part of the complex number\nprint(\"Imaginary Part: \", complex_number.imag)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We declare a complex number variable `complex_number` with the value `3 + 4j`, where `3` is the real part and `4j` is the imaginary part.\n*   We print the complex number using `print(\"Complex Number: \", complex_number)`.\n*   We access the real part of the complex number using the `.real` attribute and print it using `print(\"Real Part: \", complex_number.real)`.\n*   We access the imaginary part of the complex number using the `.imag` attribute and print it using `print(\"Imaginary Part: \", complex_number.imag)`.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the complex number and its real and imaginary parts. The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nComplex Number:  (3+4j)\nReal Part:  3.0\nImaginary Part:  4.0\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   This program can be used as a starting point for more complex mathematical operations involving complex numbers, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing complex numbers.\n*   It can also be used to demonstrate the basics of complex numbers in a mathematical or educational context.",
