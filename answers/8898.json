  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Program**\n======================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two input numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD using the math module\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for two numbers\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The least common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter two numbers when prompted.\n2. The program will calculate and print the LCM of the input numbers.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the first number: 12\nEnter the second number: 15\nThe least common multiple of 12 and 15 is: 60\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the GCD of two numbers, which is then used to calculate the LCM.\n* The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.\n* The `abs` function is used to handle cases where the input numbers are negative.",
