  "prompt": "Create a function that performs a binary search on a sorted list. The function takes in a target value and returns the index of the value in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python function that performs a binary search on a sorted list:\n```\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a binary search on a sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of values.\n        target: The value to search for in the list.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target value in the list. If the target value is not found, returns -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n```\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialize the search range**: We start by setting `low` to 0 (the first index of the list) and `high` to the last index of the list.\n2. **Loop until the search range is empty**: We continue to loop until `low` is greater than `high`.\n3. **Calculate the midpoint**: We calculate the midpoint of the search range using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n4. **Compare the midpoint value to the target**: We compare the value at the midpoint index to the target value.\n\t* If they are equal, we return the midpoint index.\n\t* If the midpoint value is less than the target, we adjust the search range to start at `mid + 1`.\n\t* If the midpoint value is greater than the target, we adjust the search range to end at `mid - 1`.\n5. **Return -1 if the target is not found**: If the loop ends without finding the target, we return -1 to indicate that the target value is not in the list.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```python\n# Create a sorted list\nsorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]\n\n# Search for a value in the list\ntarget = 9\nindex = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n# Print the result\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Target {target} found at index {index}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Target {target} not found in the list\")\n```\nThis code creates a sorted list and searches for the value 9 using the `binary_search` function. The result is then printed to the console.",
