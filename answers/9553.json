  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take two numbers and an operation as input, and then use a function to calculate and return the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations using functions:\n\n```python\n# Define a function for addition\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Define a function for subtraction\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Define a function for multiplication\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\n# Define a function for division\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the quotient of two numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\n# Define a function to get user input for the operation\ndef get_operation():\n    \"\"\"Return the operation chosen by the user.\"\"\"\n    operations = {\n        \"1\": \"Addition\",\n        \"2\": \"Subtraction\",\n        \"3\": \"Multiplication\",\n        \"4\": \"Division\"\n    }\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    for key, value in operations.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter the number of your chosen operation: \")\n        if choice in operations:\n            return choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n# Define a function to get user input for numbers\ndef get_numbers():\n    \"\"\"Return two numbers entered by the user.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            return num1, num2\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n# Define a function to perform the chosen operation\ndef perform_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"Return the result of the chosen operation.\"\"\"\n    operations = {\n        \"1\": add,\n        \"2\": subtract,\n        \"3\": multiply,\n        \"4\": divide\n    }\n    if operation == \"4\" and num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return operations[operation](num1, num2)\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    num1, num2 = get_numbers()\n    operation = get_operation()\n    try:\n        result = perform_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n*   We start by defining four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n*   We then define a function `get_operation` to get the user's chosen operation. This function displays a menu of available operations and asks the user to enter the number of their chosen operation.\n*   Next, we define a function `get_numbers` to get two numbers from the user. This function uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid input and ensures that the user enters valid numbers.\n*   The `perform_operation` function takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the chosen operation. It uses a dictionary to map the operation numbers to their corresponding functions.\n*   Finally, we define the `main` function, which coordinates the entire process. It calls `get_numbers` and `get_operation` to get the user's input, then calls `perform_operation` to calculate and display the result. If the user chooses division and the second number is zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and displays an error message.\n*   We use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.",
