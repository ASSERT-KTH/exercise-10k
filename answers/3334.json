  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the product of all the elements in the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef product_of_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the product of all elements in a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The product of all elements in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"Product of array elements:\", product_of_array(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all elements in the array.\n*   We then iterate over each element `num` in the input array `arr`.\n*   Inside the loop, we multiply the current `product` by the current number `num` and update the `product` variable with the result.\n*   After iterating over all elements, we return the final `product`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we are iterating over the array once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array. We are using a constant amount of space to store the `product` variable.",
