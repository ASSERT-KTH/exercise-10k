Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  **User Input**: The `get_user_input` function is responsible for retrieving two numbers and an operator from the user. It uses `while` loops to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and a supported operator.\n2.  **Arithmetic Operation**: The `perform_arithmetic_operation` function takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. It handles division by zero errors by raising a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n3.  **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the program's execution. It calls `get_user_input` to retrieve user input, performs the arithmetic operation using `perform_arithmetic_operation`, and prints the result. If a division by zero error occurs, it catches the exception and displays an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Valid Input**: Enter two numbers and a supported operator, such as `10`, `5`, and `+`. The program will output the result of the arithmetic operation, which in this case would be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   **Invalid Input**: Enter a non-numeric value for a number or an unsupported operator. The program will display an error message and prompt the user to re-enter the input.\n*   **Division by Zero**: Enter two numbers and the `/` or `%` operator, where the second number is zero. The program will catch the division by zero error and display an error message.",
