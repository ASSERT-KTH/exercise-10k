  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's grade as input and outputs whether the student passed or failed. The passing grade is 60. If the grade is 90 or above, the program should also output 'Excellent'. If the grade is between 80 and 89, the program should output 'Good'. If the grade is between 70 and 79, the program should output 'Fair'. If the grade is between 60 and 69, the program should output 'Pass'. If the grade is below 60, the program should output 'Fail'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n```\ndef evaluate_grade(grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates a student's grade and outputs whether the student passed or failed.\n    Also outputs a descriptive message based on the grade.\n\n    Args:\n        grade (int): The student's grade.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if grade >= 90:\n        print(\"Passed\")\n        print(\"Excellent\")\n    elif grade >= 80:\n        print(\"Passed\")\n        print(\"Good\")\n    elif grade >= 70:\n        print(\"Passed\")\n        print(\"Fair\")\n    elif grade >= 60:\n        print(\"Passed\")\n        print(\"Pass\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed\")\n        print(\"Fail\")\n\n# Example usage\ngrade = int(input(\"Enter the student's grade: \"))\nevaluate_grade(grade)\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n*   The `evaluate_grade` function takes an integer `grade` as input and uses if-elif-else statements to determine the output based on the grade.\n*   If the grade is 90 or above, the function prints \"Passed\" and \"Excellent\".\n*   If the grade is between 80 and 89, the function prints \"Passed\" and \"Good\".\n*   If the grade is between 70 and 79, the function prints \"Passed\" and \"Fair\".\n*   If the grade is between 60 and 69, the function prints \"Passed\" and \"Pass\".\n*   If the grade is below 60, the function prints \"Failed\" and \"Fail\".\n*   The example usage section prompts the user to enter a grade, converts it to an integer using `int(input(...))`, and then calls the `evaluate_grade` function with the entered grade.\n\nYou can run this code, enter a grade when prompted, and it will output whether the student passed or failed along with a descriptive message based on the grade.",
