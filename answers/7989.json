  "answer": "**Removing Duplicates from a List of Numbers**\n=====================================================\n\nHere's an example program in Python that removes duplicates from a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(num_list))\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]\nunique_numbers = remove_duplicates(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nprint(\"List without Duplicates:\", unique_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `remove_duplicates` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `set` function to convert the list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n3. The `list` function is then used to convert the set back into a list.\n4. The resulting list of unique numbers is returned.\n\n**Note:** This approach does not preserve the original order of the numbers. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_ordered(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a given list of numbers while preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list with duplicates removed and original order preserved.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in num_list if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]\nunique_numbers = remove_duplicates_ordered(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Original List:\", numbers)\nprint(\"List without Duplicates (ordered):\", unique_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation (ordered):**\n\n1. The `remove_duplicates_ordered` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers that have already been added to the result.\n3. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and add each number to the result list only if it has not been seen before.\n4. The `seen.add(x)` expression adds the current number to the `seen` set and returns `None`, which is treated as `False` in the `or` expression. This allows the list comprehension to add the number to the result list and mark it as seen in a single operation.",
