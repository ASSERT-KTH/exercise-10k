  "answer": "### Creating a Dictionary Copy\n#### Function Overview\n\nThe function `create_dict_copy` creates a copy of a given dictionary. This function utilizes Python's built-in dictionary method `copy()` to ensure a shallow copy of the dictionary is created.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef create_dict_copy(original_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a shallow copy of a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        original_dict (dict): The dictionary to be copied.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A shallow copy of the original dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return original_dict.copy()\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    original = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}\n    copied_dict = create_dict_copy(original)\n\n    print(\"Original Dictionary:\", original)\n    print(\"Copied Dictionary:\", copied_dict)\n\n    # To demonstrate that the copy is indeed separate\n    copied_dict[\"key3\"] = \"value3\"\n    print(\"After modification:\")\n    print(\"Original Dictionary:\", original)\n    print(\"Copied Dictionary:\", copied_dict)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- The `create_dict_copy` function takes one argument, `original_dict`, which is the dictionary you want to copy.\n- It uses the `copy()` method of the dictionary to create a new dictionary that is a copy of the original.\n- The function returns this copied dictionary.\n- In the example usage, we demonstrate the function's functionality by creating a copy of a dictionary, modifying the copy, and then printing both the original and the copied dictionaries to show that they are indeed separate entities.\n\n#### Important Note\n\nThis function creates a **shallow copy** of the dictionary. This means that if the dictionary contains mutable objects (like lists or other dictionaries) and you modify those objects in the copied dictionary, the same modification will be reflected in the original dictionary because both dictionaries reference the same objects. If you need a **deep copy** where even the mutable objects are copied, you would need to use the `deepcopy` function from the `copy` module.",
