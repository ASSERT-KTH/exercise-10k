  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a given list of numbers. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers, mean):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return variance\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(variance):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation from the variance.\"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers, mean)\n    standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(variance)\n    return standard_deviation\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nstandard_deviation = main(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count.\n2. The `calculate_variance` function calculates the variance of a list of numbers by summing the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the total count.\n3. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation from the variance by taking the square root.\n4. The `main` function ties everything together by calculating the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to pass a list of numbers to the `main` function.\n* The standard deviation is sensitive to outliers, so be cautious when interpreting the results.\n* This program uses a population-based standard deviation calculation. If you need to calculate the sample standard deviation, replace the division by `len(numbers)` with `len(numbers) - 1` in the `calculate_variance` function.",
