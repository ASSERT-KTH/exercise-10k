  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a function as input, and returns the result of applying the function to all elements of the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef applyToAll(lst, f):\n    return [f(i) for i in lst]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(applyToAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lambda x: x**2))\n```\nThis code defines the `applyToAll` function, which takes a list `lst` and a function `f` as input. It uses a list comprehension to apply the function `f` to each element `i` in the list `lst`, and returns the resulting list of transformed elements.\n\nThe test case applies the function `lambda x: x**2` to the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which squares each number in the list. The resulting list is `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`, which is printed to the console.\n\nNote that I used a list comprehension to implement the function, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new list by applying a transformation to each element of an existing list.",
