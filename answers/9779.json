  "prompt": "Write a program that interacts with the user, asking for input and providing feedback based on the input provided.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple example of an interactive program written in Python that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color, and then provides feedback based on the input provided.\n\n```python\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user input and provide feedback.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to our interactive program!\")\n    \n    # Ask for user's name\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    \n    # Ask for user's age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            if age < 0:\n                print(\"Age cannot be negative. Please enter a valid age.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n    \n    # Ask for user's favorite color\n    favorite_color = input(\"Please enter your favorite color: \")\n    print(f\"Your favorite color is {favorite_color}.\")\n    \n    # Provide feedback based on age\n    if age < 18:\n        print(f\"{name}, you are still young and have your whole life ahead of you!\")\n    elif age < 65:\n        print(f\"{name}, you are in the prime of your life! Enjoy every moment.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{name}, you have gained a lot of experience and wisdom. Keep sharing it with others.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function.\"\"\"\n    get_user_input()\n    print(\"Thank you for interacting with our program!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The user enters a valid name, age, and favorite color, and the program provides feedback based on the age.\n* The user enters an invalid age (e.g., a string or a negative number), and the program asks for a valid age.\n* The user enters a valid age but does not enter a favorite color, and the program still provides feedback based on the age.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `get_user_input()` that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color.\n2. The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters a valid age.\n3. The program provides feedback based on the user's age using `if-elif-else` statements.\n4. The `main()` function calls `get_user_input()` and prints a thank-you message.\n5. The program uses a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n### Note\n\n* This program does not handle all possible edge cases, such as the user pressing `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the program.\n* This program does not store the user's input in a database or file; it only provides feedback based on the input provided.\n* This program uses simple `if-elif-else` statements to provide feedback based on the user's age; more complex logic could be used to provide more personalized feedback.",
