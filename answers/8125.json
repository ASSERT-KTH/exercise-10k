  "prompt": "Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python using if/else statements.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_game():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        possible_choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(possible_choices)\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\n### How the program works:\n1. **Game Loop**: The program uses a `while True` loop to keep playing the game until the user chooses to quit.\n2. **User Input**: The user is asked to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The input is validated to ensure it's one of the three options.\n3. **Computer's Choice**: The computer's choice is selected randomly from a list of the three options.\n4. **Game Logic**: The program uses if/else statements to determine the winner based on the game's rules:\n   - If the user's choice is the same as the computer's choice, it's a tie.\n   - If the user's choice beats the computer's choice (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper), the user wins.\n   - If the user's choice loses to the computer's choice, the user loses.\n5. **Play Again**: After each game, the user is asked if they want to play again. If they choose to quit, the program ends.",
