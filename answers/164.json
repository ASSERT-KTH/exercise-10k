  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that performs basic boolean operations on two boolean variables:\n\n```python\n# Define two boolean variables\nbool1 = True\nbool2 = False\n\n# Perform AND operation\nand_result = bool1 and bool2\n\n# Perform OR operation\nor_result = bool1 or bool2\n\n# Perform NOT operation on bool1 and bool2\nnot_bool1 = not bool1\nnot_bool2 = not bool2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Boolean 1: {bool1}\")\nprint(f\"Boolean 2: {bool2}\")\nprint(f\"AND operation: {bool1} AND {bool2} = {and_result}\")\nprint(f\"OR operation: {bool1} OR {bool2} = {or_result}\")\nprint(f\"NOT operation on Boolean 1: NOT {bool1} = {not_bool1}\")\nprint(f\"NOT operation on Boolean 2: NOT {bool2} = {not_bool2}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define two boolean variables, `bool1` and `bool2`, with values `True` and `False`, respectively.\n*   We use the `and` operator to perform the AND operation, which returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.\n*   We use the `or` operator to perform the OR operation, which returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.\n*   We use the `not` operator to perform the NOT operation, which returns the opposite of the given boolean value.\n*   Finally, we print the results of each operation to demonstrate the output.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   You can replace the values of `bool1` and `bool2` with any boolean values to test different scenarios.\n*   You can also use this code as a starting point for more complex boolean operations or conditional statements.\n*   This code can be used in various applications, such as:\n    *   Logical operations in programming\n    *   Digital electronics and circuit design\n    *   Mathematical logic and proof systems\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define the boolean variables `bool1` and `bool2` with the desired values.\n2.  Perform the AND operation using the `and` operator and store the result in `and_result`.\n3.  Perform the OR operation using the `or` operator and store the result in `or_result`.\n4.  Perform the NOT operation on `bool1` and `bool2` using the `not` operator and store the results in `not_bool1` and `not_bool2`, respectively.\n5.  Print the results of each operation to verify the output.\n\nThis code provides a basic example of performing boolean operations on two boolean variables. You can extend it to handle more complex scenarios or use it as a building block for larger programs.",
