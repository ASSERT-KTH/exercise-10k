  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation as input and returns the result. The operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    if operation == \"addition\":\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"subtraction\":\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"multiplication\":\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"division\":\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n    else:\n        return \"Error: Invalid operation. Please choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\"\n\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Take user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division): \")\n\n    # Perform the operation and print the result\n    result = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, operation)\n    print(f\"The result of {operation} is: {result}\")\n\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `arithmetic_operation` function takes in two numbers and an operation as input.\n2. It checks the operation type and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n3. For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n4. The `main` function takes user input for the two numbers and the operation.\n5. It calls the `arithmetic_operation` function with the user input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n- Addition: Input `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `addition` as the operation. The output will be `15.0`.\n- Subtraction: Input `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `subtraction` as the operation. The output will be `5.0`.\n- Multiplication: Input `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `multiplication` as the operation. The output will be `50.0`.\n- Division: Input `10` as the first number, `2` as the second number, and `division` as the operation. The output will be `5.0`. If you input `0` as the second number, the output will be `Error: Division by zero is not allowed`.",
