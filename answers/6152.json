  "answer": "### Counting Substring Occurrences\n\nHere's a Python function that counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef count_substring(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The main string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the substring in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = start = 0\n    while start < len(string):\n        pos = string.find(substring, start)\n        if pos != -1:\n            start = pos + 1\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_string = \"Hello, world. Hello again.\"\n    sub_string = \"Hello\"\n    occurrences = count_substring(main_string, sub_string)\n    print(f\"'{sub_string}' occurs {occurrences} times in '{main_string}'\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `count_substring(string, substring)` takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`.\n2. It uses a `while` loop to search for the `substring` in the `string`, starting from the beginning of the `string`.\n3. If the `substring` is found, it increments the `start` index to continue searching after the found occurrence and increments the `count` variable to keep track of the occurrences.\n4. The loop continues until the `substring` is not found, at which point it breaks the loop and returns the `count`.\n5. In the example usage, the function is called with a `main_string` and a `sub_string`, and the result is printed to the console.",
