  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input and outputs a greeting message with the user's name and their age in a specific format. The program should also include input validation to ensure the user's age is within a valid range (1-120 years). If the age is not valid, the program should prompt the user to re-enter their age until a valid age is provided.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that matches the provided specifications:\n\n```python\n# Import Modules\nimport sys\n\n# Define Variables\nname = \"\"\nage = \"\"\n\n# Get User's Name\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\n# Get User's Age\nwhile True:\n    age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n    if age.isdigit() and 1 <= int(age) <= 120:\n        age = int(age)\n        break\n    print(\"Invalid age. Please enter an integer between 1 and 120.\")\n\n# Create Greeting Message\ngreeting_message = \"Hello {}! You are {} years old.\".format(name, age)\n\n# Print Greeting Message\nprint(greeting_message)\n\n# Exit Program\nsys.exit()\n```\n\nThis code follows the provided specifications exactly, importing the `sys` module, defining `name` and `age` variables, getting user input, validating the age, creating a greeting message, printing the greeting message, and exiting the program using `sys.exit()`.",
