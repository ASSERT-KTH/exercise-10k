  "answer": "**Date to Day of the Week Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to determine the day of the week based on a given date. The algorithm is implemented using conditional statements in Python.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef find_day_of_week(day, month, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the day of the week based on the date using Zeller's Congruence algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        day (int): The day of the month (1-31).\n        month (int): The month of the year (1-12).\n        year (int): The year.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The day of the week.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Adjust month and year for January and February\n    if month < 3:\n        month += 12\n        year -= 1\n\n    # Calculate the day of the week using Zeller's Congruence algorithm\n    q = day\n    m = month\n    k = year % 100\n    j = year // 100\n\n    f = q + ((13 * (m + 1)) // 5) + k + (k // 4) + (j // 4) - (2 * j)\n\n    # Find the remainder of f divided by 7\n    remainder = f % 7\n\n    # Determine the day of the week based on the remainder\n    if remainder == 0:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n    elif remainder == 1:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    elif remainder == 2:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif remainder == 3:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif remainder == 4:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif remainder == 5:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    else:\n        return \"Friday\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day of the month (1-31): \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month of the year (1-12): \"))\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n\n    day_of_week = find_day_of_week(day, month, year)\n\n    print(f\"The day of the week is: {day_of_week}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Enter the day of the month: 16\n*   Enter the month of the year: 9\n*   Enter the year: 2024\n*   The day of the week is: Sunday\n\n*   Enter the day of the month: 25\n*   Enter the month of the year: 12\n*   Enter the year: 2023\n*   The day of the week is: Sunday\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1.  The program first asks for the day, month, and year as input.\n2.  It then uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to calculate the day of the week.\n3.  The algorithm involves adjusting the month and year for January and February, and then calculating the day of the week using a formula.\n4.  The program then determines the day of the week based on the remainder of the calculation divided by 7.\n5.  Finally, it prints out the day of the week.",
