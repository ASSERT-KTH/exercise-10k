  "answer": "**Swapping Variables without a Temporary Variable**\n====================================================\n\nYou can swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable by utilizing arithmetic operations or bitwise XOR. Here are examples in Python:\n\n### Method 1: Arithmetic Operations\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using arithmetic operations.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = a + b  # Store the sum of a and b in a\n    b = a - b  # Store the difference between the sum and b in b (which is the original value of a)\n    a = a - b  # Store the difference between the sum and the new b in a (which is the original value of b)\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage\na = 5\nb = 10\nprint(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\na, b = swap_variables_arithmetic(a, b)\nprint(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Bitwise XOR\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_xor(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using bitwise XOR.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of a and b in a\n    b = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of the new a and b in b (which is the original value of a)\n    a = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of the new a and the new b in a (which is the original value of b)\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage\na = 5\nb = 10\nprint(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\na, b = swap_variables_xor(a, b)\nprint(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Tuple Packing and Unpacking (Python-specific)\n\n```python\ndef swap_variables_tuple(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using tuple packing and unpacking.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return b, a\n\n# Example usage\na = 5\nb = 10\nprint(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\na, b = swap_variables_tuple(a, b)\nprint(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n```\n\nNote that the tuple packing and unpacking method is specific to Python and is generally considered the most Pythonic way to swap variables. The arithmetic operations and bitwise XOR methods can be applied in other programming languages as well.",
