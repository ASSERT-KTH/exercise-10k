  "answer": "**Subsequence Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if the first input string is a subsequence of the second input string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if str1 is a subsequence of str2.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The potential subsequence string.\n        str2 (str): The parent string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if str1 is a subsequence of str2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0  # Index for str1\n    j = 0  # Index for str2\n\n    while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):\n        if str1[i] == str2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        j += 1\n\n    return i == len(str1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get input strings from user\n    str1 = input(\"Enter the first string: \")\n    str2 = input(\"Enter the second string: \")\n\n    # Check if str1 is a subsequence of str2\n    if is_subsequence(str1, str2):\n        print(f\"'{str1}' is a subsequence of '{str2}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"'{str1}' is not a subsequence of '{str2}'.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_subsequence` function takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the first string is a subsequence of the second.\n2. It uses two indices, `i` and `j`, to traverse `str1` and `str2`, respectively.\n3. If the characters at the current indices match, `i` is incremented to move to the next character in `str1`.\n4. `j` is always incremented to move to the next character in `str2`.\n5. If `i` reaches the end of `str1`, it means all characters in `str1` have been found in `str2` in the correct order, so the function returns `True`.\n6. The `main` function gets two input strings from the user and calls `is_subsequence` to check if the first string is a subsequence of the second.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `str1 = \"abc\", str2 = \"ahbgdc\"` -> Output: `'abc' is a subsequence of 'ahbgdc'.`\n* Input: `str1 = \"axc\", str2 = \"ahbgdc\"` -> Output: `'axc' is not a subsequence of 'ahbgdc'.`",
