  "answer": "**Student Information Storage and Printing**\n==============================================\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that declares variables to store a student's name and age, then prints them out.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables to store student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out the name and age\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\nThis code can be run in a Python environment to store and print student information. You can replace `\"John Doe\"` and `20` with the actual name and age of the student you want to store. \n\n**Alternative Approach Using a Dictionary:**\nIf you need to store more student information or want a more structured approach, consider using a dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Declare a dictionary to store student information\nstudent_info = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 20\n}\n\n# Print out the name and age\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_info[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_info[\"age\"])\n```\n\nThis approach allows for easy extension to store additional student details.",
