  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides a hint to help the user narrow down the range.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will provide a hint to help the user narrow down the range.\n5. Keep guessing until the correct number is found or type \"quit\" to give up.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until the correct number is found or the user chooses to quit. The `random.randint` function is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100. The `input` function is used to get the user's guess, and the `int` function is used to convert the user's guess to an integer. The program also includes error handling to ensure that the user's input is valid.",
