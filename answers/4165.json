  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's name and 3 grades as input and prints the average grade.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate average grade\ndef calculate_average_grade(name, grade1, grade2, grade3):\n    average_grade = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / 3\n    return average_grade\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get student's name and grades\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    grade1 = float(input(\"Enter the student's first grade: \"))\n    grade2 = float(input(\"Enter the student's second grade: \"))\n    grade3 = float(input(\"Enter the student's third grade: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(name, grade1, grade2, grade3)\n    print(f\"{name}'s average grade is {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `calculate_average_grade` function calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and then dividing by the total number of grades.\n2. In the `main` function, we first get the student's name and three grades as input from the user using the `input` function.\n3. We then call the `calculate_average_grade` function with the user's input and store the result in the `average_grade` variable.\n4. Finally, we print out the student's name and their average grade, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the student's name and three grades. After entering the information, it will print out the student's average grade.\n\n```\nEnter the student's name: John Doe\nEnter the student's first grade: 85\nEnter the student's second grade: 90\nEnter the student's third grade: 78\nJohn Doe's average grade is 84.33\n```",
