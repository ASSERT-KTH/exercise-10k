  "answer": "**Word Scramble Program**\n=========================\n\nThis program scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it. After each guess, it prints out a message indicating if the guess is correct or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble the letters of a word\"\"\"\n    letters = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(letters)\n    return ''.join(letters)\n\ndef main():\n    # List of words to choose from\n    words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']\n\n    # Choose a random word\n    word = random.choice(words)\n\n    # Scramble the word\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n\n    print(\"Unscramble the word: \", scrambled_word)\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the guess is correct\n        if guess.lower() == word:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You unscrambled the word correctly.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Sorry, that's not correct. Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input, converts it into a list of letters, shuffles the list using `random.shuffle`, and then joins the letters back into a string.\n2. The `main` function chooses a random word from a list of words, scrambles it using the `scramble_word` function, and then asks the user to unscramble it.\n3. The program continues to ask the user for their guess until they correctly unscramble the word.\n4. After each guess, the program prints out a message indicating if the guess is correct or not.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```\nUnscramble the word:  elppa\nEnter your guess: apple\nCongratulations! You unscrambled the word correctly.\n```",
