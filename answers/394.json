  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers using the following formula:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a[(\u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)^2) / (n - 1)]\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation\n- x_i is each value in the dataset\n- \u03bc is the mean of the dataset\n- n is the number of values in the dataset\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers\"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n    \n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_mean` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count.\n2. The `calculate_standard_deviation` function calculates the standard deviation using the formula above. It first calculates the mean, then calculates the variance by summing the squared differences from the mean and dividing by the total count minus one. Finally, it takes the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n3. In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the program by calculating the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* This program uses the sample standard deviation formula, which divides by `n - 1` instead of `n`. This is because we are estimating the population standard deviation from a sample of the population.\n* If you want to calculate the population standard deviation, you can modify the `calculate_standard_deviation` function to divide by `n` instead of `n - 1`.",
