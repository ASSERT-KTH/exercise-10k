  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that inserts a new element at a specified index in a list. This function will take a list, an index, and a new element as input and return the modified list. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef insert_element(lst, index, new_element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts a new element at a specified index in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The original list.\n        index (int): The index where the new element will be inserted.\n        new_element: The new element to be inserted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The modified list with the new element inserted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the index is within the bounds of the list. \n    # If it's not, we'll raise an IndexError with a descriptive message.\n    if index < 0 or index > len(lst):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n    # Now, we can use list slicing to split the list into two parts at the specified index.\n    # The part before the index will be stored in 'before', and the part after the index will be stored in 'after'.\n    # This is done to make room for the new element at the specified index.\n    before = lst[:index]  \n    # The 'after' part starts from the index to the end of the list.\n    after = lst[index:]  \n\n    # Now, we can combine the 'before' part, the new element, and the 'after' part to form the modified list.\n    # We use the '+' operator to concatenate these parts into a single list.\n    modified_list = before + [new_element] + after  \n\n    # Finally, we return the modified list.\n    return modified_list\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 5]\nprint(insert_element(my_list, 3, 4))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `insert_element` first checks if the provided `index` is within the bounds of the list `lst`. If it's not, an `IndexError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* The function then uses list slicing to split the list into two parts at the specified `index`: `before` and `after`. This is done to make room for the `new_element` at the specified `index`.\n* The `before` part, the `new_element`, and the `after` part are then combined using the `+` operator to form the `modified_list`.\n* Finally, the function returns the `modified_list`.",
