  "answer": "**Problem Statement**\nFind the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n**Solution**\n\nWe can solve this problem by using a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string. Then, we iterate through the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character. If no such character exists, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_frequency = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_frequency:\n            char_frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_frequency[char] = 1\n    \n    # Find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_frequency[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    # If no non-repeating character exists, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"aabbc\"\nresult = first_non_repeating_char(s)\nif result:\n    print(f\"The first non-repeating character is: {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No non-repeating character exists.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Create a dictionary `char_frequency` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  Iterate through the string to count the frequency of each character.\n3.  Iterate through the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.\n4.  If such a character exists, return it. Otherwise, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string twice: once to count the frequency of each character and again to find the first non-repeating character.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we need to store the frequency of each character in the dictionary.",
