  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial investment amount.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        time_period (int): The time period of the investment in years.\n        compounding_frequency (int): The number of times interest is compounded per year.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount after the given time period, including interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate / compounding_frequency) ** (compounding_frequency * time_period)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time_period = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    compounding_frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (per year): \"))\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, time_period, compounding_frequency)\n    interest = amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Amount: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound Interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {interest_rate * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Time Period: {time_period} years\")\n    print(f\"Compounding Frequency: {compounding_frequency} times per year\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n---------------------\n\n1. Run the program and enter the following values:\n\t* Principal amount: $1000\n\t* Annual interest rate: 5%\n\t* Time period: 5 years\n\t* Compounding frequency: 12 times per year (monthly)\n2. The program will calculate and display the total amount, compound interest, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThe program uses the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = total amount\nP = principal amount\nr = annual interest rate\nn = compounding frequency per year\nt = time period in years\n\nThe `calculate_compound_interest` function takes the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency as input and returns the total amount after the given time period, including interest.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to input the necessary values, calls the `calculate_compound_interest` function, and displays the results.",
