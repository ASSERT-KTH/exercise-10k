  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10 using a For Loop**\n\nHere's a simple Python program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Define the range of numbers\nstart = 1\nend = 10\n\n# Use a for loop to print the numbers\nfor i in range(start, end + 1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. We define the `start` and `end` variables to specify the range of numbers.\n2. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from `start` to `end - 1`. We add 1 to `end` to include it in the range.\n3. The `for` loop iterates over the generated sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n4. Inside the loop, we print the current number `i`.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `print_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python print_numbers.py`) to see the output.",
