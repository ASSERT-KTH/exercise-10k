  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with 'Fizz' and multiples of 5 with 'Buzz'. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz(n):\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print('FizzBuzz')\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print('Fizz')\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print('Buzz')\n        else:\n            print(i)\n\nfizzbuzz(20)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function then iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks the current number `i` to see if it is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. If `i` is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints 'FizzBuzz'. If `i` is only a multiple of 3, it prints 'Fizz'. If `i` is only a multiple of 5, it prints 'Buzz'. If `i` is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, it simply prints the number `i`.\n\nFinally, the code calls the `fizzbuzz` function with the argument `20`, which prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to 20.",
