  "answer": "**Calculating the Sum of Cubed Numbers in a List**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThis function calculates the sum of cubed numbers in a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_cubes(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of cubed numbers in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of cubed numbers in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"List must contain only numeric values\")\n\n    return sum(num ** 3 for num in numbers)\n\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_cubes(numbers)\nprint(f\"The sum of cubed numbers is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `sum_of_cubes` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It checks if the input is a list and if the list contains only numeric values.\n3. It uses a generator expression to calculate the cube of each number in the list and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the sum of cubed numbers in a list of integers: `sum_of_cubes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`\n* Calculate the sum of cubed numbers in a list of floating-point numbers: `sum_of_cubes([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5])`",
