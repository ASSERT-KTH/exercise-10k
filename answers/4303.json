  "prompt": "Create two functions, one that doubles a number and another that triples a number, and use them to create a new function that sextuples a number",
  "answer": "### Doubling and Tripling Functions\n\nBelow is a Python solution that defines two helper functions, `double` and `triple`, and then uses these to create a `sextuple` function.\n\n```python\ndef double(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Doubles a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int or float): The number to double.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The doubled number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * 2\n\n\ndef triple(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Triples a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int or float): The number to triple.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The tripled number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * 3\n\n\ndef sextuple(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sextuples a given number by tripling it and then doubling the result.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int or float): The number to sextuple.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The sextupled number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # First, triple the number\n    tripled = triple(n)\n    # Then, double the tripled number\n    sextupled = double(tripled)\n    return sextupled\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number = 5\n    print(f\"Sextupling {number} gives: {sextuple(number)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define Helper Functions**: We start by defining two helper functions, `double(n)` and `triple(n)`, each taking a number `n` as input and returning its double and triple, respectively.\n2. **Create Sextuple Function**: The `sextuple(n)` function utilizes the helper functions to first triple the input number `n`, and then doubles this tripled value to achieve sextupling.\n3. **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, we demonstrate how to use the `sextuple` function with an example number, `5`, and print the result.\n\nThis approach not only provides a clear, step-by-step method for sextupling a number but also demonstrates how smaller, reusable functions can be combined to create more complex operations.",
