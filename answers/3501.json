  "prompt": "Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively. Then print their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\n# Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.\nx = 10\ny = 20\n\n# Print their sum.\nprint(\"The sum of x and y is: \", x + y)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `The sum of x and y is:  30` \n\nThis code does the following:\n- Declares two integer variables, `x` and `y`.\n- Assigns `x` the value `10` and `y` the value `20`.\n- Prints the sum of `x` and `y` to the console. \n\nYou can also use this code in other programming languages with slight modifications. Here's how you can do it in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.\n        int x = 10;\n        int y = 20;\n\n        // Print their sum.\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of x and y is: \" + (x + y));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's the equivalent code in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare two integer variables, x and y, and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively.\n    int x = 10;\n    int y = 20;\n\n    // Print their sum.\n    std::cout << \"The sum of x and y is: \" << (x + y) << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```",
