  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two integers as input and outputs their quotient.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes that:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend / divisor\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        num1 = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n        num2 = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n        quotient = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n        print(f\"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is: {quotient}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two integers as input and returns their quotient. It also includes error checking to prevent division by zero and to ensure that the inputs are valid integers.\n\nIn the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter two integers, attempts to divide them, and then prints the result. If the user enters something that is not an integer, or if they attempt to divide by zero, the program catches the resulting exception and prints an error message.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `division_program.py`) and then run it using Python (for example, `python division_program.py`).",
