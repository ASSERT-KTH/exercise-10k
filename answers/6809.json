  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and checks if it is within a certain range. If the score is 90 or above, print 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, print 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, print 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, print 'D'. If the score is below 60, print 'F'. Use conditional statements (if/else) to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the grade checking system according to the provided specifications:\n```python\n# Get user input\npontos = int(input(\"Digite sua nota: \"))\n\n# Check if pontos is within the valid range\nif pontos < 0 or pontos > 100:\n    print(\"Nota inv\u00e1lida!\")\nelse:\n    # Evaluate pontos and print the corresponding grade\n    if pontos >= 90:\n        print(\"A\")\n    elif pontos >= 80:\n        print(\"B\")\n    elif pontos >= 70:\n        print(\"C\")\n    elif pontos >= 60:\n        print(\"D\")\n    else:\n        print(\"F\")\n\n# Wait for user input before exiting\ninput()\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement, including getting user input, checking if the input is within the valid range, evaluating the input value, and waiting for user input before exiting.",
