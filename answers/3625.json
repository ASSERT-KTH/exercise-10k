  "answer": "**First Duplicate Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate in a given list of integers. It iterates over the list and checks if each element has been seen before. If an element has been seen before, it is considered a duplicate and the program returns it.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in a given list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate in the list. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(nums)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_first_duplicate` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It creates an empty set `seen` to keep track of the elements it has seen so far.\n3. It iterates over the input list, and for each element, it checks if it is already in the `seen` set.\n4. If an element is found in the `seen` set, it means it is a duplicate, and the function returns it immediately.\n5. If an element is not in the `seen` set, it is added to the set.\n6. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it makes a single pass over the list. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, it needs to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
