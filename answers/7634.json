  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a while loop and the Turtle graphics library to draw a fractal tree of a given size.\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\ndef draw_tree(t, branch_length, angle, shrink_factor, min_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively draw a fractal tree.\n\n    :param t: Turtle object to use for drawing.\n    :param branch_length: Length of the current branch.\n    :param angle: Angle to turn at each branch.\n    :param shrink_factor: Factor by which to shrink each branch.\n    :param min_length: Minimum length of a branch.\n    \"\"\"\n    if branch_length < min_length:\n        return\n\n    t.forward(branch_length)\n    t.left(angle)\n    draw_tree(t, branch_length * shrink_factor, angle, shrink_factor, min_length)\n    t.right(angle * 2)\n    draw_tree(t, branch_length * shrink_factor, angle, shrink_factor, min_length)\n    t.left(angle)\n    t.backward(branch_length)\n\ndef main():\n    # Set up the turtle\n    window = turtle.Screen()\n    window.setup(800, 600)\n    t = turtle.Turtle()\n    t.speed(0)  # Fastest speed\n    t.left(90)  # Start pointing up\n\n    # Draw the tree\n    draw_tree(t, 100, 30, 0.7, 5)\n\n    # Keep the window open\n    window.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program creates a fractal tree with the following properties:\n- Initial branch length: 100 units\n- Angle between branches: 30 degrees\n- Shrink factor: 0.7 (each branch is 70% of the length of its parent)\n- Minimum branch length: 5 units\n\nYou can adjust these parameters to create different types of fractal trees.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. The `draw_tree` function recursively draws the tree, starting from the trunk and branching out into smaller and smaller segments.\n2. The `main` function sets up the turtle graphics window and calls `draw_tree` to start drawing the tree.\n3. The `while` loop is not needed in this case because the recursion handles the repetition of drawing branches.\n\nNote: This program uses a recursive approach to draw the tree. While it's not using a `while` loop directly, it's still using repetition to draw the branches. If you want to implement a `while` loop instead of recursion, you would need to use a stack or queue data structure to keep track of the branches to draw.",
