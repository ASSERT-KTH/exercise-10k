  "answer": "**Checking if a String is a Subsequence of Another**\n====================================================\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\" while \"aec\" is not).\n\n### Algorithm\n\nTo check if a string `s1` is a subsequence of another string `s2`, we can use a two-pointer technique:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of `s1` and `s2` respectively.\n2. Iterate through `s2`. If the character at the current position `j` in `s2` is equal to the character at the current position `i` in `s1`, increment `i`.\n3. If `i` reaches the end of `s1`, it means we have found all characters of `s1` in `s2` in the correct order, so return `True`.\n4. If we finish iterating through `s2` without finding all characters of `s1`, return `False`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subsequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if s1 is a subsequence of s2.\n\n    Args:\n        s1 (str): The potential subsequence.\n        s2 (str): The string to check against.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if s1 is a subsequence of s2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0  # Pointer for s1\n    for j in range(len(s2)):  # Iterate through s2\n        if i < len(s1) and s1[i] == s2[j]:  # If current characters match\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character in s1\n    return i == len(s1)  # Return True if we've found all characters of s1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(is_subsequence(\"ace\", \"abcde\"))  # True\n    print(is_subsequence(\"aec\", \"abcde\"))  # False\n    print(is_subsequence(\"\", \"abcde\"))  # True\n    print(is_subsequence(\"abcde\", \"\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of `s2`, because we make a single pass through `s2`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the input strings.",
