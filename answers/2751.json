  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates a vehicle's fuel efficiency given its distance traveled and fuel consumed.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates a vehicle's fuel efficiency:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed, unit='kmpl'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled by the vehicle.\n        fuel_consumed (float): The amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle.\n        unit (str, optional): The unit of fuel efficiency. Defaults to 'kmpl'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the distance or fuel consumed is zero\n    if distance == 0 or fuel_consumed == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Calculate the fuel efficiency\n    fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumed\n\n    # Convert the fuel efficiency to the desired unit\n    if unit == 'kmpl':\n        fuel_efficiency = round(fuel_efficiency, 2)  # in km/l\n    elif unit == 'mpg':\n        fuel_efficiency = round(fuel_efficiency * 2.352, 2)  # in miles/gallon\n    elif unit == 'l/100km':\n        fuel_efficiency = round(100 / fuel_efficiency, 2)  # in l/100km\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid unit. Supported units are 'kmpl', 'mpg', and 'l/100km'.\")\n\n    return fuel_efficiency\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled (in km): \"))\n    fuel_consumed = float(input(\"Enter the amount of fuel consumed (in liters): \"))\n\n    print(f\"The fuel efficiency of the vehicle is {calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed)} kmpl.\")\n\n    # Ask the user if they want to convert the fuel efficiency to a different unit\n    convert_unit = input(\"Do you want to convert the fuel efficiency to a different unit? (yes/no): \")\n    if convert_unit.lower() == 'yes':\n        unit = input(\"Enter the unit you want to convert to (kmpl, mpg, or l/100km): \")\n        print(f\"The fuel efficiency of the vehicle is {calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumed, unit)} {unit}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it as a Python file (e.g., `fuel_efficiency.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python fuel_efficiency.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function takes three arguments: `distance`, `fuel_consumed`, and `unit`. It calculates the fuel efficiency by dividing the distance traveled by the fuel consumed.\n2. The function checks if the distance or fuel consumed is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. The function converts the fuel efficiency to the desired unit (kmpl, mpg, or l/100km) based on the `unit` argument.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the distance traveled and fuel consumed, calculates the fuel efficiency using the `calculate_fuel_efficiency` function, and prints the result.\n5. The program asks the user if they want to convert the fuel efficiency to a different unit and performs the conversion if requested.",
