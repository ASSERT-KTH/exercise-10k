  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a name as input from the user and prints out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Get the user's name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Print out a greeting message\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"! Welcome!\")\n```\n\nYou can also use string formatting to make the code cleaner:\n\n```python\n# Get the user's name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Print out a greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome!\")\n```\n\nBoth of these programs will do the same thing: they will ask the user for their name, and then print out a greeting message with the user's name in it. \n\nIf you want to make this program more robust, you could add some error checking to make sure the user enters a name:\n\n```python\n# Get the user's name\nwhile True:\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    if name.strip():\n        break\n    print(\"You didn't enter a name. Please try again.\")\n\n# Print out a greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome!\")\n```\n\nThis version of the program will keep asking the user for their name until they enter something. The `strip()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace, so this program will consider a name to be valid as long as it's not just spaces or nothing.",
