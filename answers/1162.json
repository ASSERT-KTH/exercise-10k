  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Solution**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven an array of strings, find the longest common prefix among all the strings.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem by comparing each character at the same position in all the strings. If all characters at the current position are the same, we add the character to the prefix. If not, we break the loop and return the prefix.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common prefix among all the strings in the input array.\n\n    Args:\n    strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = \"\"\n    for chars in zip(*strs):\n        if len(set(chars)) == 1:\n            prefix += chars[0]\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return prefix\n\n# Example usage\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"dog\", \"racecar\", \"car\"]))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"\", \"\"]))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"a\"]))  # Output: \"a\"\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input array is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Initialize an empty string `prefix` to store the longest common prefix.\n3. Use the `zip` function to iterate over the characters at the same position in all the strings.\n4. For each position, check if all characters are the same by converting the characters to a set and checking if the set has only one element. If all characters are the same, add the character to the `prefix`.\n5. If not all characters are the same, break the loop and return the `prefix`.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings. This is because we only need to iterate over the characters at the same position in all the strings until we find a mismatch or reach the end of the shortest string.",
