  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. The program should calculate the average grade of all students and then print out the names of students who have a grade above the average.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade of all students.\n\n    Args:\n    grades (dict): A dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average grade of all students.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n\n\ndef get_students_above_average(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the names of students who have a grade above the average.\n\n    Args:\n    grades (dict): A dictionary of student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of student names who have a grade above the average.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    return [name for name, grade in grades.items() if grade > average_grade]\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    grades = {\n        \"John\": 85,\n        \"Alice\": 92,\n        \"Bob\": 78,\n        \"Charlie\": 95,\n        \"David\": 88\n    }\n\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    students_above_average = get_students_above_average(grades)\n\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n    print(\"Students with grade above average:\")\n    for student in students_above_average:\n        print(student)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **`calculate_average_grade` function**: This function calculates the average grade of all students by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of students.\n2.  **`get_students_above_average` function**: This function uses the `calculate_average_grade` function to get the average grade and then returns a list of student names who have a grade above the average.\n3.  **`main` function**: This function demonstrates the usage of the above functions with an example dictionary of student grades. It calculates the average grade, gets the list of students with grades above average, and prints the results.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to handle potential edge cases, such as an empty dictionary of grades or non-numeric grade values.\n*   Consider adding input validation to ensure that the grades are within a valid range (e.g., 0-100).\n*   You can extend this program to include more features, such as calculating the median or standard deviation of grades, or generating a histogram of grade distribution.",
