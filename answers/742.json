  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and calculates its area",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Take input from the user\nlength = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nwidth = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n# Calculate and print the area\narea = calculate_area(length, width)\nprint(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {area} square units\")\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:\n\n1. **Define the function**: We start by defining a function called `calculate_area` that takes two arguments: `length` and `width`. This function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width.\n2. **Take input from the user**: We use the `input` function to prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle. The input values are stored in the `length` and `width` variables as floating-point numbers.\n3. **Call the function and print the result**: We call the `calculate_area` function with the user-input values and store the result in the `area` variable. Finally, we print the calculated area to the console.\n\nTo run the program, simply save it to a file (e.g., `rectangle_area.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python rectangle_area.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and the program will display the calculated area.",
