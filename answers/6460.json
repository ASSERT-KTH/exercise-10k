  "answer": "**Cylinder Surface Area Calculator**\n======================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height. The surface area of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\n`A = 2 * \u03c0 * r * (r + h)`\n\nwhere:\n- `A` is the surface area of the cylinder\n- `\u03c0` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n- `r` is the radius of the cylinder\n- `h` is the height of the cylinder\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cylinder.\n        height (float): The height of the cylinder.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cylinder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height must be non-negative.\")\n\n    surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * (radius + height)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    radius = 5.0  # in units (e.g., meters, inches)\n    height = 10.0  # in units (e.g., meters, inches)\n\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cylinder_surface_area(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cylinder is {surface_area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Replace the `radius` and `height` variables in the `main` function with your desired values.\n3. The program will calculate and print the surface area of the cylinder.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This program uses the `math` module for the `\u03c0` constant.\n- The `calculate_cylinder_surface_area` function raises a `ValueError` if the radius or height is negative.\n- The `main` function demonstrates example usage and handles potential errors.",
