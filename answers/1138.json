  "answer": "**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns to mark a cell. The game ends when one player has three in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Tic-Tac-Toe game program\n\n# Import required modules\nimport os\n\n# Function to print the game board\ndef print_board(board):\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\n# Function to check if a player has won\ndef check_win(board, player):\n    winning_combinations = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combination in winning_combinations:\n        if board[combination[0]] == board[combination[1]] == board[combination[2]] == player:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Function to check if the game is a draw\ndef check_draw(board):\n    return \" \" not in board\n\n# Main game loop\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    current_player = \"X\"\n\n    while True:\n        os.system(\"cls\" if os.name == \"nt\" else \"clear\")\n        print_board(board)\n        print(f\"Player {current_player}, enter your move (1-9):\")\n        move = input()\n\n        # Validate the move\n        if not move.isdigit() or not 1 <= int(move) <= 9:\n            print(\"Invalid move. Please try again.\")\n            input(\"Press Enter to continue...\")\n            continue\n\n        move = int(move) - 1\n\n        # Check if the cell is already occupied\n        if board[move] != \" \":\n            print(\"Cell already occupied. Please try again.\")\n            input(\"Press Enter to continue...\")\n            continue\n\n        # Make the move\n        board[move] = current_player\n\n        # Check if the game is over\n        if check_win(board, current_player):\n            os.system(\"cls\" if os.name == \"nt\" else \"clear\")\n            print_board(board)\n            print(f\"Player {current_player} wins!\")\n            break\n        elif check_draw(board):\n            os.system(\"cls\" if os.name == \"nt\" else \"clear\")\n            print_board(board)\n            print(\"It's a draw!\")\n            break\n\n        # Switch to the other player\n        current_player = \"O\" if current_player == \"X\" else \"X\"\n\n# Run the game\nplay_game()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The game board will be displayed, and the current player will be prompted to enter their move.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 9 to mark the corresponding cell.\n4. The game will continue until one player has won or the game is a draw.\n5. To quit the game, press Ctrl+C or close the terminal window.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The game board is represented as a list of 9 cells, where each cell is a string (\"X\", \"O\", or \" \").\n* The `print_board` function prints the game board to the console.\n* The `check_win` function checks if a player has won by examining all possible winning combinations.\n* The `check_draw` function checks if the game is a draw by checking if all cells are occupied.\n* The `play_game` function implements the main game loop, where players take turns to make moves and the game checks for a win or draw after each move.",
