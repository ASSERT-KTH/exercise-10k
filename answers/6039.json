  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5. If the list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, raise a ValueError.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that calculates the sum of numbers in a list that are multiples of 3 or 5, while also handling invalid input. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sum_multiples(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of numbers in a list that are multiples of 3 or 5.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5\n        if num % 3 != 0 and num % 5 != 0:\n            # If it's not a multiple, raise a ValueError\n            raise ValueError(\"The list contains a number that is not a multiple of either 3 or 5\")\n        \n        # Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5\n        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:\n            # If it's a multiple, add it to the sum\n            total_sum += num\n    \n    # Return the total sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sum_multiples` initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5.\n* It then iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`. If `num` is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* If `num` is a multiple of 3 or 5, it adds `num` to `total_sum`.\n* Finally, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of 3 or 5.",
