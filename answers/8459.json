  "answer": "**Calculating the Area of a Triangle**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be non-negative\")\n    area = (base * height) / 2\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n    area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n    print(f\"The area of the triangle is: {area:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle.\n2. It checks if the base and height are non-negative, and raises a `ValueError` if they are not.\n3. It calculates the area using the formula `Area = (base * height) / 2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_triangle_area` function by asking the user for the base and height, and then printing the calculated area.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units.\n* Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 8 units.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the base and height are given in the same units (e.g. both in meters or both in inches).\n* The area is calculated to two decimal places by default, but this can be adjusted by changing the `:.2f` format specifier in the `print` statement.",
