  "answer": "Here is a Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef divide_numbers(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input, \n    divides the first number by the second, \n    and returns the result and the remainder.\n    \n    Args:\n        dividend (float): The number being divided.\n        divisor (float): The number by which we are dividing.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the division result and the remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    \n    result = dividend / divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    \n    return result, remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the input from the user\n    dividend = float(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = float(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        result, remainder = divide_numbers(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {result} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their division result and remainder. The `main` function gets the input from the user, calls `divide_numbers`, and prints the result. It also handles the case where the divisor is zero, which would cause a division by zero error.",
