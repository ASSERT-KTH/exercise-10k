  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. The algorithm repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0.\n3. The GCD is the absolute value of the final value of `a`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_gcd` function with example numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18: `calculate_gcd(48, 18)` returns 6\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns 6\n\n### Notes\n\n* This implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD.\n* The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.",
