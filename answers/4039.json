  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Function**\n======================================\n\nThe following Python function implements dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence of two input strings.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common subsequence of two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Reconstruct the longest common subsequence\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    return \"\".join(reversed(lcs))\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    str1 = \"AGGTAB\"\n    str2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\n    print(\"Longest common subsequence:\", longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**: Create a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively. Initialize all elements to 0.\n2.  **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through the characters of both strings. If the current characters match, increment the value in the DP table by 1, considering the diagonal element (`dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`). If the characters do not match, take the maximum value from the cell above (`dp[i - 1][j]`) or the cell to the left (`dp[i][j - 1]`).\n3.  **Reconstruct the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Start from the bottom-right corner of the DP table and move diagonally up-left if the characters match, adding the character to the LCS. If the characters do not match, move up or left based on which cell has a higher value.\n4.  **Return the LCS**: Join the characters in the LCS list in reverse order to form the final longest common subsequence.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this function is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n*   The space complexity is also O(m \\* n) due to the 2D DP table.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Comparing two DNA sequences to find similarities.\n*   Identifying the longest common subsequence in two versions of a document to track changes.\n*   Analyzing two strings to determine their similarity in terms of common characters.",
