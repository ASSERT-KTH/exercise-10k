  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to sum all the even numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Sums all the even numbers from 1 to 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    result = sum_even_numbers()\n    print(\"The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function initializes a `total` variable to 0.\n2. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10.\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`).\n4. If the number is even, it adds it to the `total`.\n5. The function returns the `total` sum of even numbers.\n6. The `main` function calls `sum_even_numbers` and prints the result.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30\n```\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `even_sum.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python even_sum.py`).",
