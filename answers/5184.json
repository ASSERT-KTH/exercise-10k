  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a year and determines whether it is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that asks the user for a year and determines whether it is a leap year or not:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for a year\nyear = int(input(\"Please enter a year: \"))\n\n# Determine if it's a leap year\nif year % 4 == 0:\n    if year % 100 == 0:\n        if year % 400 == 0:\n            print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\nHere's how this program works:\n\n- The program asks the user to enter a year using the `input()` function.\n- It then checks whether the year is a leap year by checking the following conditions:\n  - If the year is divisible by 4, it might be a leap year.\n  - If it is also divisible by 100, it is only a leap year if it is also divisible by 400.\n- The program then prints out whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\nAlternatively, you can simplify the program like this:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for a year\nyear = int(input(\"Please enter a year: \"))\n\n# Determine if it's a leap year\nif (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\nThis version does the same thing, but combines all the conditions into a single `if` statement.",
