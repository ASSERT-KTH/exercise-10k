  "answer": "Here's a Python program that analyzes a given text and provides statistics such as word count, character count, and more.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given text and returns statistics.\n    \n    Args:\n    text (str): The text to analyze.\n    \n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the text statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    text = text.strip()\n    \n    # Calculate word count\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', text.lower())\n    word_count = len(words)\n    \n    # Calculate character count\n    character_count = len(text)\n    \n    # Calculate sentence count\n    sentence_count = len(re.findall(r'[.!?]', text))\n    \n    # Calculate average word length\n    average_word_length = sum(len(word) for word in words) / word_count if word_count > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Calculate most common words\n    most_common_words = Counter(words).most_common(5)\n    \n    # Calculate most common word length\n    word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]\n    most_common_word_length = Counter(word_lengths).most_common(1)[0][0]\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the statistics\n    statistics = {\n        \"word_count\": word_count,\n        \"character_count\": character_count,\n        \"sentence_count\": sentence_count,\n        \"average_word_length\": average_word_length,\n        \"most_common_words\": most_common_words,\n        \"most_common_word_length\": most_common_word_length\n    }\n    \n    return statistics\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the text from the user\n    text = input(\"Please enter the text to analyze: \")\n    \n    # Analyze the text\n    statistics = analyze_text(text)\n    \n    # Print the statistics\n    print(\"\\nText Statistics:\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    print(f\"Word Count: {statistics['word_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Character Count: {statistics['character_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Sentence Count: {statistics['sentence_count']}\")\n    print(f\"Average Word Length: {statistics['average_word_length']:.2f}\")\n    print(\"Most Common Words:\")\n    for word, count in statistics['most_common_words']:\n        print(f\"  {word}: {count}\")\n    print(f\"Most Common Word Length: {statistics['most_common_word_length']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program first imports the necessary modules, including `re` for regular expressions and `Counter` from the `collections` module for counting the most common words.\n*   The `analyze_text` function takes the text as input, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and calculates the word count, character count, sentence count, average word length, most common words, and most common word length.\n*   The `main` function gets the text from the user, calls the `analyze_text` function, and prints the statistics.\n*   The program uses regular expressions to find words and sentences in the text.\n*   The `Counter` class is used to count the most common words and word lengths.\n*   The program prints the statistics in a readable format.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1.  Run the program.\n2.  Enter a text when prompted, such as \"This is a sample text. It has multiple sentences.\"\n3.  The program will print the text statistics, including word count, character count, sentence count, average word length, most common words, and most common word length.\n\nNote: This program considers punctuation as part of a sentence and does not handle cases where a sentence ends with multiple punctuation marks. It also does not handle cases where a word is split across multiple lines. For a more robust text analysis program, you may need to use natural language processing techniques and libraries such as NLTK or spaCy.",
