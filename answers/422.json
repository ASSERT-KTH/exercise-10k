  "answer": "**Getting User Input and Printing a Greeting Message**\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that asks for the user's name and prints out a greeting message:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Ask the user for their name\"\"\"\n    user_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    return user_name\n\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"Print a greeting message\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome!\")\n\ndef main():\n    user_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(user_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `get_user_name` function uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for their name.\n2. The `print_greeting` function takes a name as an argument and prints out a greeting message using an f-string.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_user_name` to get the user's name and then calls `print_greeting` with the user's name.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name and press Enter, it will print out a greeting message with your name. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nHello, John! Welcome!\n```",
