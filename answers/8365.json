  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their modular sum (i.e., the remainder when their sum is divided by 10).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef modular_sum(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the modular sum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The modular sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a + b) % 10\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    result = modular_sum(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The modular sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `modular_sum` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their modular sum.\n*   The modular sum is calculated using the formula `(a + b) % 10`, where `%` is the modulus operator that returns the remainder of the division.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `modular_sum` function by taking two numbers as input from the user, calculating their modular sum, and printing the result.",
