  "prompt": "Given a dictionary with names of students as keys and their grades as values, write a program to check if a specific student is in the dictionary.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution to check if a specific student is in the dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef check_student(grades_dict, student_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a specific student is in the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): Dictionary with student names as keys and grades as values.\n        student_name (str): Name of the student to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the student is in the dictionary, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the student name is in the dictionary keys\n    return student_name in grades_dict\n\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades_dict = {\n    \"John Doe\": 85,\n    \"Jane Doe\": 90,\n    \"Bob Smith\": 78\n}\n\nstudent_to_check = \"Jane Doe\"\n\nif check_student(grades_dict, student_to_check):\n    print(f\"{student_to_check} is in the dictionary with a grade of {grades_dict[student_to_check]}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{student_to_check} is not in the dictionary\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define a function `check_student` that takes two arguments: `grades_dict` (the dictionary with student grades) and `student_name` (the name of the student to check).\n2. Inside the function, we use the `in` operator to check if the `student_name` is a key in the `grades_dict`.\n3. If the student is found, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n4. In the example usage, we create a sample dictionary `grades_dict` and set `student_to_check` to \"Jane Doe\".\n5. We call the `check_student` function and print a message indicating whether the student is in the dictionary or not. If they are, we also print their grade.",
