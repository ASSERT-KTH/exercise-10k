  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list and a condition as input, and returns two lists: one with the elements that satisfy the condition and one with the elements that do not.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that separates a list into two based on a given condition, and provide you with a clear understanding of how it works. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef separate_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and a condition as input, \n    and returns two lists: one with the elements that satisfy the condition \n    and one with the elements that do not.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list to be separated.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements that satisfy the condition, \n        and the second list contains elements that do not.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two empty lists to store the elements that satisfy the condition and those that do not\n    satisfied = []\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the elements that do not satisfy the condition\n    not_satisfied = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # Check if the condition is met for the current element\n        if condition(element):\n            # If the condition is met, append the element to the 'satisfied' list\n            satisfied.append(element)\n        else:\n            # If the condition is not met, append the element to the 'not_satisfied' list\n            not_satisfied.append(element)\n\n    # Return a tuple containing the 'satisfied' and 'not_satisfied' lists\n    return satisfied, not_satisfied\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\neven_numbers, odd_numbers = separate_list(numbers, is_even)\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `separate_list` takes two parameters: `input_list` and `condition`. It initializes two empty lists, `satisfied` and `not_satisfied`, to store elements that meet and don't meet the condition, respectively.\n*   It iterates over each element in `input_list`, applying the `condition` function to determine whether the element should be added to `satisfied` or `not_satisfied`.\n*   Finally, it returns a tuple containing the `satisfied` and `not_satisfied` lists, which can be unpacked into separate variables for further use, as shown in the example with `even_numbers` and `odd_numbers`.",
