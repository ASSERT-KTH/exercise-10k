  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that implements the grade calculation based on the score:\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade (A, B, C, D, or F).\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the student's grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes an integer `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade as a string.\n*   The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, calls `calculate_grade` to calculate the grade, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on the score.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n*   Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n*   Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n*   Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n*   Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `grade_calculator.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3.  Run the program using the command `python grade_calculator.py`.\n4.  Follow the prompt to enter the student's score, and the program will display the corresponding grade.",
