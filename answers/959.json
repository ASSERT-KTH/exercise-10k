  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints Pascal's triangle up to the 10th row using a for loop:\n```python\ndef print_pascal_triangle(n):\n    # Initialize the first row\n    row = [1]\n\n    # Print each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Print the current row\n        print(' ' * (n - i - 1) + ' '.join(str(num) for num in row))\n\n        # Calculate the next row\n        row = [x + y for x, y in zip([0] + row, row + [0])]\n\n# Print Pascal's triangle up to the 10th row\nprint_pascal_triangle(10)\n```\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1. The `print_pascal_triangle` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of rows to print.\n2. The first row of Pascal's triangle is initialized as `[1]`.\n3. The outer loop iterates `n` times, printing each row of the triangle.\n4. Inside the loop, the current row is printed using a string formatting trick: `' ' * (n - i - 1)` creates a string of spaces to indent the row, and `' '.join(str(num) for num in row)` converts the row's numbers to strings and joins them with spaces.\n5. To calculate the next row, we use a list comprehension: `[x + y for x, y in zip([0] + row, row + [0])]`. This works by:\n\t* Adding a `0` to the beginning and end of the current row using `[0] + row` and `row + [0]`.\n\t* Zipping the two lists together using `zip`.\n\t* Adding corresponding elements from the two lists together using `x + y`.\n6. The resulting list is assigned to `row`, which becomes the next row to print.\n\nRunning this code will print Pascal's triangle up to the 10th row:\n```\n         1 \n        1 1 \n       1 2 1 \n      1 3 3 1 \n     1 4 6 4 1 \n    1 5 10 10 5 1 \n   1 6 15 20 15 6 1 \n  1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1 \n 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 \n1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1 \n```",
