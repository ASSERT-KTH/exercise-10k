  "prompt": "Write a program that uses functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should take the length and width of the rectangle as input and then call two separate functions to calculate the area and perimeter. The results should then be printed out to the user.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int l, w;\n\n    printf(\"Enter length: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &l);\n\n    printf(\"Enter width: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &w);\n\n    int a = area(l, w);\n    int p = per(l, w);\n\n    printf(\"Area: %d\\n\", a);\n    printf(\"Perimeter: %d\\n\", p);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint area(int l, int w) {\n    return l * w;\n}\n\nint per(int l, int w) {\n    return 2 * (l + w);\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines the `area` and `per` functions, which calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, respectively. The `main` function prompts the user to input the length and width of the rectangle, calls the `area` and `per` functions, and then prints the results to the console.",
