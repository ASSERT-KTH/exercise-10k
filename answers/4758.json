  "answer": "**Minimum of Two Numbers Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns the minimum of the two.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the minimum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int or float): The first number.\n        num2 (int or float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The minimum of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return min(num1, num2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Find and print the minimum\n    minimum = find_minimum(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The minimum of {num1} and {num2} is {minimum}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `5` and `10`, Output: `The minimum of 5.0 and 10.0 is 5.0`\n* Input: `20` and `15`, Output: `The minimum of 20.0 and 15.0 is 15.0`\n* Input: `10.5` and `5.2`, Output: `The minimum of 10.5 and 5.2 is 5.2`\n\n### How to Run\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `minimum_program.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python minimum_program.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.\n5. The program will print the minimum of the two numbers.",
