  "answer": "**Library Management System**\n================================\n\nThis program uses a while loop to manage a library's collection of books. It allows users to add, remove, and search for books.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nclass Book:\n    def __init__(self, title, author, year):\n        self.title = title\n        self.author = author\n        self.year = year\n\nclass Library:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.books = []\n\n    def add_book(self, title, author, year):\n        new_book = Book(title, author, year)\n        self.books.append(new_book)\n        print(f\"Added '{title}' by {author} ({year})\")\n\n    def remove_book(self, title):\n        for book in self.books:\n            if book.title.lower() == title.lower():\n                self.books.remove(book)\n                print(f\"Removed '{title}'\")\n                return\n        print(f\"'{title}' not found in library\")\n\n    def search_book(self, title):\n        for book in self.books:\n            if book.title.lower() == title.lower():\n                print(f\"Found '{title}' by {book.author} ({book.year})\")\n                return\n        print(f\"'{title}' not found in library\")\n\n    def display_books(self):\n        if not self.books:\n            print(\"Library is empty\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Library Books:\")\n            for book in self.books:\n                print(f\"{book.title} by {book.author} ({book.year})\")\n\ndef main():\n    library = Library()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nLibrary Management System\")\n        print(\"1. Add Book\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Book\")\n        print(\"3. Search Book\")\n        print(\"4. Display Books\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            title = input(\"Enter book title: \")\n            author = input(\"Enter book author: \")\n            year = input(\"Enter book year: \")\n            library.add_book(title, author, year)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            title = input(\"Enter book title: \")\n            library.remove_book(title)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            title = input(\"Enter book title: \")\n            library.search_book(title)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            library.display_books()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Exiting library management system\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. Adding a book:\n\t* Enter your choice: 1\n\t* Enter book title: To Kill a Mockingbird\n\t* Enter book author: Harper Lee\n\t* Enter book year: 1960\n\t* Added 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee (1960)\n2. Removing a book:\n\t* Enter your choice: 2\n\t* Enter book title: To Kill a Mockingbird\n\t* Removed 'To Kill a Mockingbird'\n3. Searching for a book:\n\t* Enter your choice: 3\n\t* Enter book title: The Great Gatsby\n\t* Found 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)\n4. Displaying all books:\n\t* Enter your choice: 4\n\t* Library Books:\n\t\t+ The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)\n\t\t+ Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813)\n\nNote: This program uses a simple text-based interface and does not store data persistently. In a real-world application, you would want to use a database to store book information.",
