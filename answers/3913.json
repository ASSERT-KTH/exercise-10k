  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): The initial amount of money borrowed or invested.\n    - annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n    - years (int): The number of years the money is borrowed or invested for.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = principal * annual_interest_rate * years\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    annual_interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%): \"))\n    annual_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 100  # Convert to decimal\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: ${simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\n    # Calculate and display the total amount\n    total_amount = principal + simple_interest\n    print(f\"The total amount is: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n1. **Investment**: Calculate the simple interest earned on an investment of $1,000 with an annual interest rate of 5% over 2 years.\n2. **Loan**: Calculate the simple interest owed on a loan of $5,000 with an annual interest rate of 10% over 5 years.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `simple_interest_calculator.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program using the command `python simple_interest_calculator.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.\n5. The program will display the simple interest and total amount.",
