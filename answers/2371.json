  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the simple interest on a loan based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates simple interest on a loan.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount borrowed.\n        rate (float): The interest rate as a decimal.\n        time (int): The time period in years.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest on the loan.\n    \"\"\"\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate simple interest\n    simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The simple interest on the loan is: ${simple_interest:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The total amount to be paid is: ${principal + simple_interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The program will then calculate and display the simple interest on the loan and the total amount to be paid.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter the principal amount: $1000\nEnter the interest rate (in %): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nThe simple interest on the loan is: $100.00\nThe total amount to be paid is: $1100.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The interest rate is assumed to be a decimal value (e.g., 5% is entered as 0.05).\n* The time period is assumed to be in years.\n* The program uses the formula for simple interest: `I = P * r * t`, where `I` is the interest, `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.",
