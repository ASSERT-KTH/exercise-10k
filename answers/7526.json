  "prompt": "Create a function called math_operation that takes two numbers and an operation as input. The operation can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'. The function should then perform the specified mathematical operation on the two numbers and return the result.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic mathematical operations based on the input provided, ensuring it's well-structured and easy to understand. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef math_operation(num1, num2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs a specified mathematical operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operation (str): The mathematical operation to be performed. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the mathematical operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the four basic mathematical operations.\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the operation is division and the second number is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the operation is valid\n    if operation not in ['addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. It can be 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', or 'division'.\")\n\n    # Then, we perform the specified operation\n    if operation == 'addition':\n        # If the operation is addition, we simply add the two numbers\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == 'subtraction':\n        # If the operation is subtraction, we subtract the second number from the first\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == 'multiplication':\n        # If the operation is multiplication, we multiply the two numbers\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == 'division':\n        # If the operation is division, we divide the first number by the second\n        # We also check if the second number is zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    # Finally, we return the result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `math_operation` takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`, allowing it to perform calculations based on the specified operation.\n* It first checks if the `operation` is valid, raising a `ValueError` if it's not one of the four basic mathematical operations, ensuring the function is used correctly.\n* For each valid operation, it performs the corresponding mathematical calculation, handling the case for division where it checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `num2` is zero.\n* Finally, it returns the result of the mathematical operation, providing the outcome of the specified calculation.",
