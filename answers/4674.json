  "answer": "**Least Frequent Character Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program takes a string as input, counts the frequency of each character, and returns the character with the least frequency.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef least_frequent_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the least frequent character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The least frequent character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n\n    # Find the minimum frequency\n    min_freq = min(char_count.values())\n\n    # Find all characters with the minimum frequency\n    least_frequent_chars = [char for char, freq in char_count.items() if freq == min_freq]\n\n    # Return the first least frequent character\n    return least_frequent_chars[0]\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    least_frequent = least_frequent_char(input_str)\n    print(f\"The least frequent character in '{input_str}' is: {least_frequent}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. The `least_frequent_char` function takes a string `s` as input and removes any whitespace.\n2. It then converts the string to lowercase to ensure the character count is case-insensitive.\n3. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character in the string.\n4. The minimum frequency is found using the `min` function.\n5. A list comprehension is used to find all characters with the minimum frequency.\n6. The first least frequent character is returned.\n7. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated, where the least frequent character in the string \"Hello, World!\" is found and printed.",
