  "answer": "**Alternate Case Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string as input and returns a new string with alternating case for each character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef alternate_case(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Alternate the case of all characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with alternating case.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    upper = True  # Start with uppercase\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():  # Check if the character is a letter\n            if upper:\n                result += char.upper()\n            else:\n                result += char.lower()\n            upper = not upper  # Toggle the case\n        else:\n            result += char  # Non-letter characters are not changed\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(alternate_case(\"Hello World\"))  # Output: \"HeLlO wOrLd\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the output.\n2. Initialize a boolean `upper` to `True`, indicating that the first character should be uppercase.\n3. Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`.\n4. If `char` is a letter (checked using `isalpha()`), toggle its case based on the current value of `upper`.\n5. Add the character (with its new case) to the `result` string.\n6. Toggle the `upper` boolean for the next character.\n7. If `char` is not a letter, add it to the `result` string without changing its case.\n8. Return the `result` string.\n\nNote: This function considers non-letter characters (such as spaces, punctuation, and digits) as separators and does not change their case.",
