  "answer": "**Floating Point Precision Demo**\n=====================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the precision of floating-point numbers in programming. It highlights the limitations and potential issues that can arise when working with floating-point arithmetic.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef floating_point_precision_demo():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the precision of floating-point numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize two floating-point numbers\n    num1 = 0.1\n    num2 = 0.2\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers\n    sum_result = num1 + num2\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Sum: {sum_result}\")\n\n    # Check if the sum is equal to the expected result (0.3)\n    print(f\"Is sum equal to 0.3? {sum_result == 0.3}\")\n\n    # Initialize two floating-point numbers with a large difference in magnitude\n    num3 = 1e16\n    num4 = 1.0\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers\n    sum_result_large = num3 + num4\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Sum (large numbers): {sum_result_large}\")\n\n    # Check if the sum is equal to the expected result (1e16)\n    print(f\"Is sum (large numbers) equal to 1e16? {sum_result_large == 1e16}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    floating_point_precision_demo()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The program initializes two floating-point numbers `num1` and `num2` with values 0.1 and 0.2, respectively.\n2. It calculates the sum of these two numbers and stores the result in `sum_result`.\n3. The program then checks if the sum is equal to the expected result (0.3) using the `==` operator.\n4. The program also initializes two floating-point numbers `num3` and `num4` with values 1e16 and 1.0, respectively, to demonstrate the limitations of floating-point arithmetic when dealing with large differences in magnitude.\n5. It calculates the sum of these two numbers and stores the result in `sum_result_large`.\n6. The program then checks if the sum is equal to the expected result (1e16) using the `==` operator.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nSum: 0.30000000000000004\nIs sum equal to 0.3? False\nSum (large numbers): 1e+16\nIs sum (large numbers) equal to 1e16? True\n```\n\n**Note**\n-------\n\nThe output shows that the sum of `num1` and `num2` is not exactly equal to 0.3 due to the limitations of floating-point precision. However, the sum of `num3` and `num4` is equal to 1e16 because the difference in magnitude between the two numbers is so large that the addition of 1.0 does not affect the result. This demonstrates the importance of considering the precision and magnitude of floating-point numbers when working with arithmetic operations.",
