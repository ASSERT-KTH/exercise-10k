  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the sides of a triangle as input and returns its perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its sides:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.\n\n    Parameters:\n    a (float): The length of the first side.\n    b (float): The length of the second side.\n    c (float): The length of the third side.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The perimeter of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the sides can form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"The sides cannot form a valid triangle\")\n\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = a + b + c\n    return perimeter\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Take the sides of the triangle as input\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of the first side: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of the second side: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of the third side: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and print the perimeter\n        perimeter = calculate_perimeter(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The perimeter of the triangle is: {perimeter}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_perimeter` that takes the lengths of the sides of a triangle as input and returns the perimeter. It also checks if the sides can form a valid triangle. The `main` function takes the sides as input from the user, calculates the perimeter, and prints the result. If the sides cannot form a valid triangle, it prints an error message.",
