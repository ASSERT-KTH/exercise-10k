  "answer": "**Finding the Index of a Substring**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python function that uses the built-in `str.find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring_index(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The string to search in.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.find(substring)\n\n# Example usage:\nmain_string = \"Hello, world! Hello again!\"\nsubstring_to_find = \"Hello\"\nindex = find_substring_index(main_string, substring_to_find)\n\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"The substring '{substring_to_find}' was found at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The substring '{substring_to_find}' was not found.\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n*   The `find_substring_index` function takes two arguments: `string` and `substring`.\n*   It uses the `str.find()` method to search for the `substring` within the `string`.\n*   If the `substring` is found, the method returns the index of the first occurrence.\n*   If the `substring` is not found, the method returns -1.\n\n**Note**: This function is case-sensitive and considers the substring as a whole. If you need a case-insensitive search or want to find all occurrences, you may need to modify the function accordingly.",
