  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all the even numbers removed. The function should also return the count of even numbers removed.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a solution to create a function that takes a list of integers, removes the even numbers, and returns the updated list along with the count of even numbers removed. This will be achieved through a Python function that utilizes list comprehension and a counter variable. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_even_numbers(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of integers as input, removes all the even numbers from the list, \n    and returns a new list with only the odd numbers along with the count of even numbers removed.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the new list with only odd numbers and the count of even numbers removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of even numbers removed\n    even_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for num in input_list:\n        # Check if the number is even by using the modulus operator\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # If the number is even, increment the even count\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            # If the number is odd, add it to the odd_numbers list\n            odd_numbers.append(num)\n\n    # Return a tuple containing the list of odd numbers and the count of even numbers removed\n    return odd_numbers, even_count\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nodd_numbers, even_count = remove_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\nprint(\"Even numbers removed:\", even_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `remove_even_numbers` initializes an empty list `odd_numbers` to store the odd numbers from the input list and a counter `even_count` to track the number of even numbers removed.\n*   It iterates over each number `num` in the input list, checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`num % 2 == 0`), and updates the `even_count` or appends the number to `odd_numbers` accordingly.\n*   Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the list of odd numbers (`odd_numbers`) and the count of even numbers removed (`even_count`).\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `remove_even_numbers` function with a sample list of numbers and print the resulting list of odd numbers and the count of even numbers removed.",
