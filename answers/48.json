  "answer": "**Problem Statement**\nFind the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n**Solution**\nHere is a Python solution that uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate in the array. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\narr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to store the elements we've seen so far.\n2. We iterate through the array, and for each element, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n3. If it is, we return the element as it's the first duplicate.\n4. If not, we add the element to the `seen` set.\n5. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return None.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we're doing a constant-time operation (set lookup) for each element in the array.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(n), because in the worst case, we might have to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
