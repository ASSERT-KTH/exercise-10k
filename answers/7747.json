  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop, then prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code that satisfies the given specifications:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop\ni = 10\nwhile i >= 1:\n    print(i)\n    i -= 1\n```\n\nThis code first uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10. Then, it uses a `while` loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1. The `while` loop is initialized with the variable `i` set to 10 and continues to print the value of `i` and decrement it until `i` is less than 1. \n\nNote: I used `range(1, 11)` instead of `range(1, 10)` because the `range()` function in Python is exclusive of the end value, so `range(1, 10)` would only go up to 9.",
