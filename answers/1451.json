  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the total cost of a meal and a tip percentage as input and outputs the total amount to pay.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total amount to pay for a meal given the meal cost and tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        meal_cost (float): The total cost of the meal.\n        tip_percentage (float): The percentage of the meal cost to use as a tip.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount to pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the tip percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100\n    tip_decimal = tip_percentage / 100\n    \n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = meal_cost * tip_decimal\n    \n    # Calculate the total amount to pay\n    total_amount = meal_cost + tip_amount\n    \n    return total_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the meal cost and tip percentage from the user\n    meal_cost = float(input(\"Enter the total cost of the meal: $\"))\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the total amount to pay\n    total_amount = calculate_total_cost(meal_cost, tip_percentage)\n    print(f\"The total amount to pay is: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `calculate_total_cost` function takes two arguments: `meal_cost` and `tip_percentage`.\n2. The function converts the `tip_percentage` to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n3. It then calculates the `tip_amount` by multiplying the `meal_cost` by the `tip_decimal`.\n4. Finally, it calculates the `total_amount` by adding the `meal_cost` and `tip_amount`.\n5. In the `main` function, we get the `meal_cost` and `tip_percentage` from the user using the `input` function.\n6. We then call the `calculate_total_cost` function with these values and display the result using the `print` function.\n7. The `:.2f` in the `print` statement formats the `total_amount` to display two decimal places.",
