  "prompt": "Write a program to take a user's name as input and print out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a greeting message to the user.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The user's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the user's name\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n    # Print out the greeting message\n    print_greeting(name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter your name when prompted. The program will then print out a greeting message with your name.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the program works:\n\n1. The `print_greeting` function takes a `name` parameter and prints out a greeting message using an f-string.\n2. The `main` function gets the user's name using the built-in `input` function and then calls `print_greeting` with the user's name.\n3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only called when the program is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another program).",
