  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of numbers using loops. The pattern should consist of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input provided by the user. The pattern should be printed in the following format: 1, 2, 3, ..., n-2, n-1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 3, 2, 1",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n```\n# Import the sys module\nimport sys\n\n# Get the input from the user\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Check if the input is valid\nif n < 1:\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n    sys.exit()\n\n# Print the pattern\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    print(i, end=', ')\n\nfor i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    if i == 1:\n        print(i)\n    else:\n        print(i, end=', ')\n```\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification, including importing the sys module, getting user input, checking for valid input, printing the first half of the pattern, and printing the second half of the pattern.",
