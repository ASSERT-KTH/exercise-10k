  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True if it is odd and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that determines whether a given number is odd or not, and provide you with a clear understanding of how it works. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_odd(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given number is odd or not.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is odd, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is an integer. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n\n    # Now, we use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of the number by 2.\n    # If the remainder is 1, the number is odd. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.\n    remainder = n % 2\n    \n    # We then use a conditional statement to return True if the remainder is 1 and False otherwise.\n    # This is equivalent to saying: return remainder == 1.\n    return remainder == 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_odd(n)` first checks if the input `n` is an integer using `isinstance(n, int)`. If not, it raises a TypeError with a descriptive message.\n* It then calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 using the modulus operator `%`, storing the result in the variable `remainder`.\n* The function uses a conditional statement to return `True` if `remainder` is 1 (indicating an odd number) and `False` otherwise.\n* This logic is concisely captured in the return statement `return remainder == 1`, which directly evaluates to `True` or `False` based on the value of `remainder`.",
