  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n\nThe following code defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number and demonstrates its usage.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        # Base case: factorial of 0 and 1 is 1\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_number = 5\n    try:\n        result = factorial(input_number)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {input_number} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if the input number is negative and raises a `ValueError` if so, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1, as the factorial of both 0 and 1 is 1.\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`, effectively calculating `n! = n * (n-1)!`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function with an example input and prints the result.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly, but not when it's imported as a module.",
