  "answer": "**Quiz Program**\n================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that asks the user a series of quiz questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n```python\n# quiz_program.py\n\n# Define a dictionary to store quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"Who painted the Starry Night?\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\",\n    \"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?\": \"William Shakespeare\"\n}\n\ndef ask_question(question, answer):\n    \"\"\"Ask the user a question and check their response.\"\"\"\n    user_response = input(question + \" \")\n    if user_response.lower() == answer.lower():\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef run_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"Run the quiz and keep track of the user's score.\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, answer in questions.items():\n        if ask_question(question, answer):\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {answer}.\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz program!\")\n    score = run_quiz(quiz_questions)\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n---------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `quiz_program.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python quiz_program.py`).\n3. Answer the quiz questions when prompted.\n4. The program will display your score at the end.\n\n**Adding More Questions**\n----------------------\n\nTo add more questions to the quiz, simply add more key-value pairs to the `quiz_questions` dictionary. For example:\n\n```python\nquiz_questions = {\n    # ... existing questions ...\n    \"What is the smallest country in the world?\": \"Vatican City\",\n    \"Who wrote the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\": \"Harper Lee\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will add two new questions to the quiz. You can add as many questions as you like!",
