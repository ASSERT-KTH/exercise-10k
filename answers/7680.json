  "answer": "**Character Count Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_character(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the character in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.count(char)\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    count = count_character(string, char)\n    print(f\"The character '{char}' occurs {count} times in the string '{string}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `count_character` function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified character.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `count_character` function with an example string and character.\n*   The example usage prints the count of the specified character in the string.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to pass a single character as the second argument to the `count_character` function.\n*   This function is case-sensitive, so it treats uppercase and lowercase characters as distinct.\n*   If you need to count characters in a case-insensitive manner, convert both the string and the character to lowercase or uppercase before calling the `count_character` function.",
