  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\nV = s^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and s is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of the side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the calculated volume.\n2. The function checks if the side length is negative, and if so, raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The volume is calculated using the formula V = s^3, where s is the side length.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the side length of the cube.\n5. The `calculate_cube_volume` function is called with the user-input side length, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a side length of 5 to calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5 units.\n* Enter a side length of -3 to see an error message indicating that the side length cannot be negative.",
