  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time as input, and returns the simple interest.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the simple interest.\n\n    Args:\n    principal (float): The principal amount.\n    rate (float): The interest rate (in percent).\n    time (float): The time period (in years).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The simple interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the interest rate from percent to a decimal\n    rate = rate / 100\n    \n    # Calculate the simple interest\n    simple_interest = principal * rate * time\n    \n    return simple_interest\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the principal amount, interest rate, and time from the user\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in percent): \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the simple interest\n    interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\n    print(f\"The simple interest is: {interest}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n2. **Calculate Simple Interest**: The `calculate_simple_interest` function takes the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as input, converts the interest rate from percent to a decimal, and calculates the simple interest using the formula `simple_interest = principal * rate * time`.\n3. **Display Result**: The program displays the calculated simple interest.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the principal amount: 1000\nEnter the interest rate (in percent): 5\nEnter the time period (in years): 2\nThe simple interest is: 100.0\n```",
