  "answer": "**Factors of a Number Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program prints the factors of a given number using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_factors(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the factors of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to find factors for.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Factors of {num}:\")\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            print(i)\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    print_factors(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_factors` function takes an integer `num` as input and prints its factors.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `num` (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4. If `num` is divisible by `i`, it prints `i` as a factor.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, converts it to an integer, and calls the `print_factors` function.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter a number: 12\nFactors of 12:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n12\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number. For large numbers, a more efficient algorithm may be needed.\n* The program only prints the factors, but you can modify it to return them as a list or perform other operations as needed.",
