  "prompt": "Write a program that takes input from the user and writes it to stderr.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a message: \")\n    sys.stderr.write(user_input + \"\\n\")\n    sys.stderr.flush()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the built-in `input` function to get a line of text from the user, then writes that text to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`) followed by a newline character. The `sys.stderr.flush()` call is used to ensure that the output is displayed immediately, as `sys.stderr` is typically buffered.\n\nYou can run this program from the command line. When you run it, it will prompt you to enter a message. After you enter a message and press Enter, the message will be written to the standard error stream. \n\nPlease note that the output will be displayed in the console, but it will not be captured by any redirection of the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`). For example, if you run the program like this:\n\n```bash\npython program.py > output.txt\n```\n\nThe output will still be displayed in the console, not written to `output.txt`. \n\nIf you want to capture the output, you would need to redirect the standard error stream, like this:\n\n```bash\npython program.py 2> error.txt\n```",
