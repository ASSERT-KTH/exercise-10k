  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list and two indices as input, and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second index.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that extracts a slice of a list based on given indices. This function will help you manipulate lists by retrieving specific segments. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef slice_list(input_list, start_index, end_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list and two indices as input, \n    and returns a slice of the list from the first index to the second index.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list to be sliced.\n        start_index (int): The starting index of the slice.\n        end_index (int): The ending index of the slice.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A slice of the input list from the start_index to the end_index.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a list\n    if not isinstance(input_list, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n\n    # Then, we need to check if the start and end indices are integers\n    if not isinstance(start_index, int) or not isinstance(end_index, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Start and end indices must be integers\")\n\n    # Next, we need to check if the start index is less than or equal to the end index\n    if start_index > end_index:\n        raise ValueError(\"Start index cannot be greater than end index\")\n\n    # Now, we need to check if the start and end indices are within the bounds of the list\n    if start_index < 0 or end_index > len(input_list):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n    # Finally, we can return the slice of the list using Python's list slicing feature\n    # The slicing operation will include all elements from the start index up to but not including the end index\n    return input_list[start_index:end_index]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `slice_list` starts by validating the input type, ensuring `input_list` is indeed a list, and both `start_index` and `end_index` are integers. This is crucial for preventing potential errors during the slicing operation.\n* It then checks if the `start_index` is less than or equal to the `end_index`, as well as if both indices are within the bounds of the `input_list`. These checks help avoid `ValueError` and `IndexError` exceptions.\n* Once all checks pass, the function utilizes Python's list slicing feature to return a subset of `input_list`, from `start_index` up to but not including `end_index`.\n* The function includes detailed documentation, specifying the types of the input parameters and the return value, making it easier for users to understand its usage and expected output.",
