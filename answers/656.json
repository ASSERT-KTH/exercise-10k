  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\" until the user correctly guesses the number.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n\n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess, and the program will provide feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\".\n4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n5. Type \"quit\" to exit the program and reveal the correct answer.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the `random` module to generate a random number.\n* It uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number.\n* It uses `try`-`except` blocks to handle invalid user input (e.g., non-integer guesses).\n* It keeps track of the number of attempts the user makes and displays it when they correctly guess the number.",
