  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a variable number of arguments and prints their sum. This function will be able to handle any number of input values. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef print_sum(*args):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a variable number of arguments, adds them up, and prints the sum.\n\n    Args:\n        *args: A variable number of arguments\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0. This will be used to store the sum of all the arguments.\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each argument passed to the function.\n    for arg in args:\n        # Add the current argument to the total sum.\n        total_sum += arg\n\n    # Print the total sum after iterating over all arguments.\n    print(total_sum)\n\n\n# Test the function with some numbers.\n# The function will print the sum of these numbers.\nprint_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `print_sum` is defined with `*args` as its parameter, allowing it to accept a variable number of arguments.\n* Inside the function, a `for` loop iterates over each argument in `args`, adding it to the `total_sum` variable.\n* After all arguments have been processed, the function prints the `total_sum`.\n* The function is then tested with a call to `print_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, demonstrating its usage.",
