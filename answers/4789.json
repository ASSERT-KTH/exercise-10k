  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, it provides feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\" until the user correctly guesses the number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I'll stop playing. The number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number and ask you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. The program will provide feedback in the form of \"too high\" or \"too low\".\n5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to stop playing and reveal the number.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number or type \"quit\". It also includes basic error handling to handle invalid user input.",
