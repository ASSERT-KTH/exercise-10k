  "prompt": "Write a program to classify a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef classify_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    scores = [95, 85, 75, 65, 55]\n    for score in scores:\n        grade = classify_grade(score)\n        print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `classify_grade` function takes an integer `score` as input and returns a string representing the grade.\n*   It uses conditional statements (`if` and `elif`) to determine the grade based on the score.\n*   The `main` function tests the `classify_grade` function with a list of scores and prints the corresponding grades.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This program assumes that the input score is an integer. You may want to add error handling to handle non-integer inputs.\n*   You can modify the grade classification criteria by changing the conditions in the `if` and `elif` statements.\n*   You can also extend this program to handle additional requirements, such as calculating the average score or displaying a histogram of grades.",
