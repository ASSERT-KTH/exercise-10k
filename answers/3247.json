  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input, adds them up, and divides by the total count of numbers to get the average.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    count = len(numbers)\n    average = total / count\n\n    return average\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. It first checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. It then calculates the sum of the numbers using the built-in `sum` function and the count of numbers using the `len` function.\n4. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n6. The average is printed to the console with two decimal places using an f-string.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average of a list of exam scores: `[90, 80, 70, 85, 95]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of temperatures: `[25, 30, 28, 22, 29]`\n* Calculate the average of a list of stock prices: `[100, 120, 110, 130, 105]`",
