  "prompt": "Create a function that partitions a list into two sublists based on a given condition.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll help you create a function that divides a list into two sublists based on a given condition. This function will allow you to separate items in a list based on whether they meet a specific criteria. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef partition_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions a list into two sublists based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be partitioned.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two lists. The first list contains elements for which the condition is True,\n               and the second list contains elements for which the condition is False.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize two empty lists to store the partitioned elements\n    true_list = []\n    \n    # This list will store elements for which the condition is False\n    false_list = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # Check if the condition is met for the current element\n        if condition(element):\n            # If the condition is True, append the element to the true_list\n            true_list.append(element)\n        else:\n            # If the condition is False, append the element to the false_list\n            false_list.append(element)\n\n    # Return a tuple containing the two partitioned lists\n    return true_list, false_list\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a condition function that checks if a number is even\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\n# Partition a list of numbers based on the is_even condition\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven_numbers, odd_numbers = partition_list(numbers, is_even)\n\nprint(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `partition_list` function takes two parameters: `input_list` (the list to be partitioned) and `condition` (a function that determines whether an element should be in the first or second sublist).\n*   Inside the function, two empty lists (`true_list` and `false_list`) are initialized to store the partitioned elements. The function then iterates over each element in `input_list`, applying the `condition` function to determine which list to append the element to.\n*   Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `true_list` and `false_list`, which represent the partitioned sublists.\n*   In the example usage, a condition function `is_even` is defined to check if a number is even, and then the `partition_list` function is used to partition a list of numbers into even and odd numbers.",
