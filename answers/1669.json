  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI (body mass index) and classifies them as 'underweight', 'normal', 'overweight', or 'obese' based on the following criteria: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal (18.5 <= BMI < 25), overweight (25 <= BMI < 30), obese (BMI >= 30) using if/else statements",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates BMI and classifies a person based on their weight and height:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate BMI and classify a person\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n\n    # Classify the person based on their BMI\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        classification = \"underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        classification = \"normal\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        classification = \"overweight\"\n    else:\n        classification = \"obese\"\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f} and you are {classification}.\")\n\n# Take user input\ndef main():\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    # Call the function\n    calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n# Run the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function definition**: We define a function `calculate_bmi` that takes two parameters: `weight` and `height`.\n2. **BMI calculation**: We calculate the BMI by dividing the weight by the square of the height.\n3. **Classification**: We use if/else statements to classify the person based on their BMI.\n4. **Result**: We print the calculated BMI and the corresponding classification.\n5. **User input**: In the `main` function, we take the user's weight and height as input using the `input` function.\n6. **Function call**: We call the `calculate_bmi` function with the user's input.\n7. **Program execution**: The program is executed using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard.\n\n### Example use case\n\nWhen you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your weight and height. For example:\n\n```\nEnter your weight in kg: 70\nEnter your height in meters: 1.75\n```\n\nThe program will then calculate and print your BMI and classification:\n\n```\nYour BMI is 22.86 and you are normal.\n```",
