  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the product of a set of numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the product of a set of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product(numbers):\n    product = 1\n    for number in numbers:\n        product *= number\n    return product\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a set of numbers separated by space: \")\n    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n    product = calculate_product(numbers)\n    print(\"The product of the numbers is: \", product)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `calculate_product` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.\n3. It then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying the `product` variable by the current number.\n4. Finally, it returns the calculated product.\n5. In the `main` function, the program asks the user to input a set of numbers separated by spaces.\n6. It then converts the input string into a list of integers using a list comprehension.\n7. It calls the `calculate_product` function with the list of numbers and prints the result.\n\nYou can also use the `math.prod` function from Python 3.8 onwards to calculate the product of a set of numbers in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = input(\"Enter a set of numbers separated by space: \")\n    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n    product = math.prod(numbers)\n    print(\"The product of the numbers is: \", product)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
