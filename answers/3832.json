  "answer": "Here's a Python program that will take a student's grades as input and calculate their average grade:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade():\n    # Get the number of grades from the user\n    num_grades = int(input(\"Enter the number of grades: \"))\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the grades\n    grades = []\n\n    # Get each grade from the user and add it to the list\n    for i in range(num_grades):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(f\"Enter grade {i+1}: \"))\n                if 0 <= grade <= 100:\n                    grades.append(grade)\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Grade must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the average grade\n    average_grade = sum(grades) / num_grades\n\n    # Print the average grade\n    print(f\"Your average grade is: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\ncalculate_average_grade()\n```\n\nThis program will:\n\n1. Ask the user for the number of grades they want to enter.\n2. Ask the user for each grade, checking to make sure it's a valid number between 0 and 100.\n3. Calculate the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n4. Print the average grade to the user, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nNote: This program uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user enters something that's not a number. It also checks to make sure the grade is between 0 and 100, and asks the user to enter it again if it's not.",
