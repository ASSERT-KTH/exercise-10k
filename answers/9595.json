  "answer": "**Square Calculator Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program reads a user-provided number and prints out its square.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_square(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the square of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The number to calculate the square of.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The square of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return number ** 2\n\ndef main():\n    # Read user input\n    while True:\n        try:\n            number = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the square\n    square = calculate_square(number)\n    print(f\"The square of {number} is {square}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a number when prompted (e.g., `5`).\n3. The program will print out the square of the entered number (e.g., `The square of 5.0 is 25.0`).\n\n### Notes\n* The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user input is a valid number.\n* The `calculate_square` function takes a number as input and returns its square using the exponentiation operator (`**`).\n* The `main` function reads user input, calculates the square, and prints the result.",
