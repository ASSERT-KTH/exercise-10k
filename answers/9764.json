  "answer": "**Midpoint Calculator Program**\n====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the midpoint of a line given the coordinates of two points.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_midpoint(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the midpoint of a line given two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): Coordinates of the first point (x1, y1)\n        point2 (tuple): Coordinates of the second point (x2, y2)\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: Coordinates of the midpoint (x, y)\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    x_midpoint = (x1 + x2) / 2\n    y_midpoint = (y1 + y2) / 2\n    return (x_midpoint, y_midpoint)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n    midpoint = calculate_midpoint(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The midpoint of the line between {point1} and {point2} is {midpoint}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_midpoint` function takes two tuples as input, each representing the coordinates of a point.\n2. The function calculates the midpoint using the formula: `(x1 + x2) / 2` for the x-coordinate and `(y1 + y2) / 2` for the y-coordinate.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_midpoint` function with an example.\n4. The program prints the coordinates of the midpoint to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the midpoint of a line segment in a 2D coordinate system.\n* Find the center of a rectangle or a circle given the coordinates of two opposite points.\n* Use the midpoint formula in computer graphics, game development, or geographic information systems (GIS) applications.",
