  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is a perfect square, and false otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the math library to check if a number is a perfect square:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_perfect_square(25))  # True\nprint(is_perfect_square(26))  # False\n```\n\nThis function works by taking the square root of the input number `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, its square root will be an integer. The `math.sqrt` function returns a floating-point number, so we compare it to its integer value using `int(sqrt)`. If they are equal, then `n` is a perfect square, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nNote that this function also handles negative numbers correctly. A negative number cannot be a perfect square, because the square of any real number is non-negative. Therefore, if `n` is negative, we immediately return `False`.",
