  "prompt": "Write a program that takes in a student's score and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that follows the given conditions:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the score is within the range of A (90-100)\n    if 90 <= score <= 100:\n        return 'A'\n    \n    # Check if the score is within the range of B (80-89)\n    elif 80 <= score < 90:\n        return 'B'\n    \n    # Check if the score is within the range of C (70-79)\n    elif 70 <= score < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    \n    # Check if the score is within the range of D (60-69)\n    elif 60 <= score < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    \n    # If the score is below 60, the grade is F\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    \n    # Ensure the score is within the valid range (0-100)\n    while score < 0 or score > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    \n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_grade` that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade. The `main` function gets the score from the user, ensures it's within the valid range, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result. The program handles invalid inputs and provides feedback to the user.",
