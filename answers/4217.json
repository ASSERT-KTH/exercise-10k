  "answer": "**Calculating the Median of an Array**\n\n### Overview\nThe median is the middle value of a sorted array. If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle element. If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. **Sort the array**: Arrange the elements in the array in ascending order.\n2. **Determine the length of the array**: Find the number of elements in the array.\n3. **Calculate the median**:\n\t* If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n\t* If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose we have the following array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`\n\n1. Sort the array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` (already sorted)\n2. Determine the length: 5 (odd)\n3. Calculate the median: The middle element is `5`, so the median is `5`.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nHere is an example implementation in Python:\n```python\ndef calculate_median(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the array\n    array.sort()\n\n    # Determine the length of the array\n    length = len(array)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    if length % 2 == 0:  # Even length\n        mid1 = array[length // 2 - 1]\n        mid2 = array[length // 2]\n        median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n    else:  # Odd length\n        median = array[length // 2]\n\n    return median\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nmedian = calculate_median(array)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)  # Output: 5\n```\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the array. The subsequent steps have a time complexity of O(1).",
