  "answer": "**Modulus Operation Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the result of the modulus operation on two numbers. The modulus operation returns the remainder of the division of the dividend (the number being divided) by the divisor (the number by which we are dividing).\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef modulus_operation(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of the modulus operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return dividend % divisor\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    result = modulus_operation(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"The result of {dividend} % {divisor} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `modulus_operation` function takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, as input.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero, in which case it raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.\n3. If the `divisor` is not zero, it calculates the result of the modulus operation using the `%` operator.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `modulus_operation` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* `modulus_operation(17, 5)` returns `2` because `17` divided by `5` leaves a remainder of `2`.\n* `modulus_operation(10, 2)` returns `0` because `10` divided by `2` leaves no remainder.\n* `modulus_operation(7, 0)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.",
