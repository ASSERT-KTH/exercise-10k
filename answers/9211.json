  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    score = float(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"Your grade is {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_grade` that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their score, calls the `calculate_grade` function to determine the grade, and then prints the grade to the console. The program uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine the grade based on the score.",
