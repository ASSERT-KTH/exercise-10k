  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the longest common prefix in a list of strings. It iterates over the characters of the first string in the list and checks if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings. If a mismatch is found, it returns the common prefix up to that point.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix in a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    strs = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\n    print(longest_common_prefix(strs))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Check if the input list `strs` is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2.  Find the shortest string in the list using the `min` function with `key=len`. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3.  Iterate over the characters of the shortest string using `enumerate`.\n4.  For each character, iterate over the other strings in the list and check if the character at the same position is the same.\n5.  If a mismatch is found, return the common prefix up to the current position using slicing (`shortest_str[:i]`).\n6.  If no mismatch is found after iterating over all characters, return the entire shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the list. This is because we iterate over the characters of the shortest string and for each character, we iterate over the other strings.",
