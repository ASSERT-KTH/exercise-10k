  "answer": "### Sum of Squares Function\n#### Description\nThis function calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = sum_of_squares(numbers)\n    print(f\"The sum of squares of {numbers} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `sum_of_squares` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to calculate the square of each number in the list.\n3. The built-in `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of these squares.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n#### Example Use Case\n* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n* Output: `55` (because `1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55`)",
