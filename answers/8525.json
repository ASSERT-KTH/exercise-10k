  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in 2D Space**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space. The Euclidean distance, also known as the straight-line distance, is the shortest distance between two points.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x1, y1).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Euclidean distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    point1 = (1, 2)  # coordinates of the first point\n    point2 = (4, 6)  # coordinates of the second point\n\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points.\n2. It calculates the Euclidean distance using the formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2).\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_distance` function with an example.\n4. The program prints the calculated distance between the two points.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the distance between two cities on a map.\n* Determining the proximity of two objects in a game or simulation.\n* Measuring the distance between two points in a graphical user interface (GUI).",
