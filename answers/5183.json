  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their score on a test and calculates their grade based on the following scale:\n- A (90-100)\n- B (80-89)\n- C (70-79)\n- D (60-69)\n- F (below 60)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score on the test.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade (A, B, C, D, or F).\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for their score\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter your score (0-100): \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input.

Run the program.\n2. Enter your score when prompted (e.g., 85).\n3. The program will print your grade based on the score (e.g., B).\n\nNote: This program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the grade. It also includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid score between 0 and 100.",
