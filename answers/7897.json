  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements (if/else) to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses conditional statements to determine a student's grade based on their score:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a student's score.\n2. **Grade Calculation**: The `calculate_grade` function takes the score as input and uses conditional statements to determine the grade.\n3. **Grade Display**: The program displays the calculated grade.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n* If the user enters a score of `95`, the program will display `The student's grade is: A`.\n* If the user enters a score of `85`, the program will display `The student's grade is: B`.\n* If the user enters a score of `75`, the program will display `The student's grade is: C`.\n* If the user enters a score of `65`, the program will display `The student's grade is: D`.\n* If the user enters a score of `55`, the program will display `The student's grade is: F`.\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `grade_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python grade_calculator.py`). Then, follow the prompt to enter a student's score.",
