  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. The user will provide the number of rows and columns for the pattern. Use loops to generate the pattern and ensure that the number of asterisks in each row corresponds to the column number. For example, if the user inputs 5 rows and 5 columns, the output should be a square of asterisks with 5 asterisks in each row.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\n# Program to generate a pattern of asterisks (*)\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Current Date]\n\nimport time\n\n# Function to generate the pattern\ndef pattern():\n    # Get the number of rows and columns from the user\n    rows = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    columns = int(input(\"Enter the number of columns: \"))\n\n    # Generate the pattern\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(columns):\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n\n# Call the pattern function\npattern()\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they are not relevant to the code itself. You can fill them in as needed. Also, I've used the `int()` function to convert the user input to integers, as the `input()` function returns a string.",
