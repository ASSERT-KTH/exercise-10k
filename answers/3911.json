  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the future value of an investment given the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the future value of an investment using the formula for compound interest:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the future value of an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of the investment.\n        annual_interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        years (int): The number of years the money is invested.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The future value of the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n    future_value = principal * (1 + annual_interest_rate) ** years\n    return future_value\n\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    annual_interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage: \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n\n    future_value = calculate_future_value(principal, annual_interest_rate, years)\n\n    print(f\"The future value of the investment is: ${future_value:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses the formula for compound interest to calculate the future value of an investment:\n\nFV = PV x (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n* FV is the future value\n* PV is the present value (the principal amount)\n* r is the annual interest rate as a decimal\n* n is the number of years\n\nThe program first defines a function `calculate_future_value` that takes the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years as arguments and returns the future value.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to input the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and then calls the `calculate_future_value` function to calculate the future value. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf you want to calculate the future value of an investment of $1000 with an annual interest rate of 5% for 10 years, you would input the following values:\n\n* Principal amount: 1000\n* Annual interest rate: 5\n* Number of years: 10\n\nThe program would then output the future value of the investment.",
