  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the sum of all elements in a list of lists, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_elements(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all elements in a list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list_of_lists (list): A list containing lists of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all elements in the list of lists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the sum variable to 0. This variable will store the sum of all elements in the list of lists.\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists.\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # For each sublist, iterate over each element in the sublist.\n        for element in sublist:\n            # Add the current element to the total sum.\n            total_sum += element\n\n    # Return the total sum after iterating over all elements in the list of lists.\n    return total_sum\n\n\n# Example usage:\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(sum_of_elements(list_of_lists))  # Output: 45\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `sum_of_elements` takes a `list_of_lists` as input and initializes a variable `total_sum` to store the sum of all elements.\n*   It then iterates over each `sublist` in the `list_of_lists` and for each `sublist`, it iterates over each `element`, adding it to the `total_sum`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `total_sum` after iterating over all elements in the `list_of_lists`.",
