  "answer": "**Chatbot Simulator Program**\n================================\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis program simulates a simple chatbot that responds to user input based on a set of predefined rules. The rules are defined as a dictionary where the keys are the user inputs and the values are the corresponding chatbot responses.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the `random` module for generating random responses\nimport random\n\n# Define the chatbot rules\nchatbot_rules = {\n    'hello': 'Hi, how are you?',\n    'hi': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?',\n    'how are you': 'I\\'m doing great, thanks for asking!',\n    'what is your purpose': 'I\\'m here to assist and chat with you.',\n    'default': 'Sorry, I didn\\'t understand that. Can you please rephrase?'\n}\n\n# Define a function to get the chatbot response\ndef get_chatbot_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"Returns the chatbot response based on the user input.\"\"\"\n    user_input = user_input.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive matching\n    for key in chatbot_rules:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return chatbot_rules[key]\n    return chatbot_rules['default']  # Return the default response if no match is found\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot simulator!\")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':  # Exit the program if the user types 'quit'\n            print(\"Chatbot: Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        chatbot_response = get_chatbot_response(user_input)\n        print(f\"Chatbot: {chatbot_response}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Type a message, such as \"hello\" or \"how are you\".\n3. The chatbot will respond based on the predefined rules.\n4. Type \"quit\" to exit the program.\n\n### Adding New Rules\n\nTo add new rules, simply update the `chatbot_rules` dictionary with new key-value pairs. For example:\n```python\nchatbot_rules['what is your name'] = 'I\\'m an AI chatbot, nice to meet you!'\n```\nThis will add a new rule that responds to the user input \"what is your name\" with the chatbot response \"I'm an AI chatbot, nice to meet you!\".",
