  "answer": "**Car Insurance Premium Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the car insurance premium based on the driver's age and number of accidents.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_premium(age, accidents):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the car insurance premium based on the driver's age and number of accidents.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The driver's age.\n        accidents (int): The number of accidents the driver has been involved in.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The car insurance premium.\n    \"\"\"\n    base_premium = 500.0  # Base premium\n    age_factor = 0.0  # Age factor\n    accident_factor = 0.0  # Accident factor\n\n    # Calculate age factor\n    if age < 25:\n        age_factor = 0.2  # 20% increase for drivers under 25\n    elif age >= 65:\n        age_factor = 0.1  # 10% increase for drivers over 65\n\n    # Calculate accident factor\n    if accidents == 0:\n        accident_factor = -0.1  # 10% discount for no accidents\n    elif accidents == 1:\n        accident_factor = 0.05  # 5% increase for one accident\n    elif accidents > 1:\n        accident_factor = 0.1  # 10% increase for multiple accidents\n\n    # Calculate premium\n    premium = base_premium * (1 + age_factor + accident_factor)\n\n    return premium\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    accidents = int(input(\"Enter the number of accidents you've been involved in: \"))\n\n    # Calculate premium\n    premium = calculate_premium(age, accidents)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Your car insurance premium is: ${premium:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* A 30-year-old driver with no accidents:\n\t+ Input: `age = 30`, `accidents = 0`\n\t+ Output: `Your car insurance premium is: $450.00`\n* A 25-year-old driver with one accident:\n\t+ Input: `age = 25`, `accidents = 1`\n\t+ Output: `Your car insurance premium is: $525.00`\n* A 70-year-old driver with multiple accidents:\n\t+ Input: `age = 70`, `accidents = 2`\n\t+ Output: `Your car insurance premium is: $660.00`\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program defines a `calculate_premium` function that takes the driver's age and number of accidents as input.\n2. The function calculates an age factor and an accident factor based on the input values.\n3. The function calculates the premium by multiplying the base premium by the age factor and accident factor.\n4. The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_premium` function, and prints the result.\n\nNote: This is a simplified example and actual car insurance premiums may be calculated using more complex formulas and factors.",
