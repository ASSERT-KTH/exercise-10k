  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\nThis program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user is prompted to choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner using conditional statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"Rock\" and computer_choice == \"Scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"Paper\" and computer_choice == \"Rock\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"Scissors\" and computer_choice == \"Paper\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): \")\n        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()\n        if user_choice not in [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n        if play_again.lower() != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program and enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) when prompted.\n2. The computer will generate a random choice and display both choices.\n3. The program will determine the winner based on the game rules and display the result.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter \"yes\" to play another round or \"no\" to exit the program.\n\n### Game Rules\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Paper beats Rock\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* If both choices are the same, it's a tie.",
