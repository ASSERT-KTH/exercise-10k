  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        cout << i << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the necessary header file, uses the `std` namespace, and defines the `main` function as specified. The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the user, loops from 1 to `n`, and prints the value of the loop variable `i` on each iteration. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
