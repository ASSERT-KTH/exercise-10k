  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    i = 1\n    total = 0\n    while i <= n:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n        i += 1\n    return total\n\nprint(sum_even_numbers(10))\n```\n\nIn this program, we start from `i = 1` and keep incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration of the while loop. If `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`), we add it to the `total`. The loop continues until `i` is greater than `n`, which is 10 in this case.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output `30`, which is the sum of the even numbers from 1 to 10: `2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`.",
