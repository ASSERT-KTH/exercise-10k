  "answer": "**Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**\n=============================================\n\nHere is a simple Python program that uses a set to keep track of unique characters and then constructs a new string with these characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Remove duplicate characters from a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(\"Original String:\", input_string)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_string))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n2. For each character, we check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n3. If it's not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and append it to the `result` list.\n4. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we're doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst-case scenario (when all characters are unique), we'll be storing all characters in the `seen` set and the `result` list.",
