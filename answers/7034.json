  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a list of student scores as input and rearranges them in ascending order. The program should also calculate the average score.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef sort_and_average_scores(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of scores in ascending order and calculates the average score.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of student scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the sorted list of scores and the average score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the scores in ascending order\n    sorted_scores = sorted(scores)\n\n    # Calculate the average score\n    average_score = sum(sorted_scores) / len(sorted_scores) if sorted_scores else 0\n\n    return sorted_scores, average_score\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89]\n    sorted_scores, average_score = sort_and_average_scores(scores)\n\n    # Print the sorted scores\n    print(\"Sorted Scores:\")\n    for i, score in enumerate(sorted_scores, start=1):\n        print(f\"Student {i}: {score}\")\n\n    # Print the average score\n    print(f\"\\nAverage Score: {average_score:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The `sort_and_average_scores` function takes a list of scores as input.\n2. It sorts the scores in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function.\n3. It calculates the average score by summing up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. If the list is empty, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sort_and_average_scores` function with an example list of scores.\n5. It prints out the sorted scores and the average score, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nSorted Scores:\nStudent 1: 76\nStudent 2: 78\nStudent 3: 85\nStudent 4: 88\nStudent 5: 89\nStudent 6: 90\nStudent 7: 92\nStudent 8: 95\n\nAverage Score: 87.38\n```",
