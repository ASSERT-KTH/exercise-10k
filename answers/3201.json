  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num1 (int): The first number\n    num2 (int): The second number\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of num1 and num2\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Take two numbers as input from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of the two numbers is: \", sum_of_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses two functions: `add_numbers` and `main`. The `add_numbers` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. The `main` function takes two numbers as input from the user, calculates their sum using the `add_numbers` function, and then prints the result.\n\nYou can run this program, enter two numbers when prompted, and it will print their sum.",
