  "prompt": "Write a program that filters a dictionary based on a condition and returns a new dictionary with the filtered key-value pairs.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef filter_dict(d, condition):\n    if not callable(condition):\n        raise TypeError(\"Condition must be a callable\")\n    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if condition(k, v)}\n\ndef is_even(k, v):\n    return v % 2 == 0\n\nd = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3, \"d\": 4}\nprint(filter_dict(d, is_even))  # Output: {\"b\": 2, \"d\": 4}\n```\nThis code defines the `filter_dict` function, which takes a dictionary `d` and a condition function `condition` as input. It checks if the `condition` argument is a callable (i.e., a function) and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.\n\nThe `filter_dict` function then uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` for which the `condition` function returns `True`.\n\nThe `is_even` function is a simple example of a condition function that takes a key-value pair `(k, v)` as input and returns `True` if the value `v` is even (i.e., `v % 2 == 0`).\n\nFinally, the code creates a sample dictionary `d` and passes it to the `filter_dict` function along with the `is_even` condition function. The resulting dictionary is printed to the console, which contains only the key-value pairs where the value is even.",
