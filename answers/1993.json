  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a discount based on the total cost of a purchase. The discount rates are as follows:\n\n* 0% discount for purchases under $100\n* 5% discount for purchases between $100 and $500\n* 10% discount for purchases between $501 and $1000\n* 15% discount for purchases over $1000\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(total_cost):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount based on the total cost.\n\n    Args:\n        total_cost (float): The total cost of the purchase.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discount amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if total_cost < 100:\n        discount_rate = 0\n    elif 100 <= total_cost <= 500:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    elif 501 <= total_cost <= 1000:\n        discount_rate = 0.10\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.15\n\n    discount_amount = total_cost * discount_rate\n    return discount_amount\n\ndef main():\n    total_cost = float(input(\"Enter the total cost: $\"))\n    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_cost)\n    print(f\"Discount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total cost after discount: ${total_cost - discount_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function takes the total cost as an argument and calculates the discount rate based on the conditional statements.\n2. The discount rate is then used to calculate the discount amount by multiplying it with the total cost.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the total cost, calculates the discount amount using the `calculate_discount` function, and prints the discount amount and the total cost after discount.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter the total cost: $50\n\t+ Discount: $0.00\n\t+ Total cost after discount: $50.00\n* Enter the total cost: $200\n\t+ Discount: $10.00\n\t+ Total cost after discount: $190.00\n* Enter the total cost: $1200\n\t+ Discount: $180.00\n\t+ Total cost after discount: $1020.00",
