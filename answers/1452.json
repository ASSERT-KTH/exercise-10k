  "answer": "**Sales Tax Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the total amount to pay based on the subtotal and sales tax rate.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total(subtotal, tax_rate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total amount to pay based on the subtotal and sales tax rate.\n\n    Args:\n        subtotal (float): The subtotal amount.\n        tax_rate (float): The sales tax rate as a decimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total amount to pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    tax_amount = subtotal * tax_rate\n    total = subtotal + tax_amount\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    subtotal = float(input(\"Enter the subtotal: $\"))\n    tax_rate = float(input(\"Enter the sales tax rate (in %): \")) / 100\n\n    # Calculate total amount to pay\n    total = calculate_total(subtotal, tax_rate)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Subtotal: ${subtotal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Sales Tax ({tax_rate*100}%): ${subtotal * tax_rate:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total: ${total:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the subtotal (e.g., `100.00`).\n3. Enter the sales tax rate (e.g., `8.25`).\n4. The program will output the subtotal, sales tax amount, and total amount to pay.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The sales tax rate is expected to be entered as a percentage (e.g., `8.25` for 8.25%).\n* The program uses the formula `total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)` to calculate the total amount to pay.\n* The result is printed to two decimal places using the `:.2f` format specifier.",
