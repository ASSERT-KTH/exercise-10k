  "answer": "**Character Frequency Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program reads a string from the user and calculates the frequency of each character.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input string from the user\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\n    # Calculate character frequency\n    frequency_dict = calculate_character_frequency(input_string)\n\n    # Print character frequency\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a string when prompted (e.g., \"Hello World\").\n3. The program will display the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_character_frequency` function iterates over each character in the input string.\n2. If a character is already in the `frequency_dict`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. The `main` function reads the input string from the user, calculates the character frequency using the `calculate_character_frequency` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Alternative Solution using Python's Built-in `Counter` Class\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = Counter(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which provides a convenient way to count the frequency of elements in a collection.",
