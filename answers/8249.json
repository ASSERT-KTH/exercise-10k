  "answer": "**Number Guessing Program**\n================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that uses if/else statements to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number():\n    # Initialize the range of possible numbers\n    low = 1\n    high = 100\n\n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n\n    # Loop until the number is guessed\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the middle of the range\n        guess = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # Ask the user if the guess is correct\n        print(f\"Is your number {guess}?\")\n        response = input(\"(h)igher, (l)ower, or (c)orrect: \")\n\n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n\n        # Check the user's response\n        if response == \"h\":\n            # If the guess is too low, update the range\n            low = guess + 1\n        elif response == \"l\":\n            # If the guess is too high, update the range\n            high = guess - 1\n        elif response == \"c\":\n            # If the guess is correct, print the result and exit\n            print(f\"Yay! I guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            # If the user enters an invalid response, ask again\n            print(\"Invalid response. Please enter (h)igher, (l)ower, or (c)orrect.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program initializes the range of possible numbers (1-100) and the number of attempts (0).\n2. The program calculates the middle of the range (`guess`) and asks the user if the guess is correct.\n3. The user responds with one of the following:\n\t* `(h)igher`: The guess is too low, so the program updates the range to start from `guess + 1`.\n\t* `(l)ower`: The guess is too high, so the program updates the range to end at `guess - 1`.\n\t* `(c)orrect`: The guess is correct, so the program prints the result and exits.\n4. The program repeats steps 2-3 until the number is guessed.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo use the program, simply run it and follow the prompts. For example:\n\n```\nIs your number 50?\n(h)igher, (l)ower, or (c)orrect: h\nIs your number 75?\n(h)igher, (l)ower, or (c)orrect: l\nIs your number 67?\n(h)igher, (l)ower, or (c)orrect: c\nYay! I guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
