  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a score as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the grade based on the score.\"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Get the score from the user and print the corresponding grade.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter your score (0-100): \"))\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                grade = calculate_grade(score)\n                print(f\"Your grade is: {grade}\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given scale.\n2. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It uses a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input until a valid score is entered.\n3. **Input Validation**: The program checks if the input is a number and within the range of 0 to 100. If not, it displays an error message and asks for input again.\n4. **Grade Calculation**: Once a valid score is entered, the program calls the `calculate_grade` function to determine the grade.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the calculated grade to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95 to get a grade of A.\n* Enter a score of 85 to get a grade of B.\n* Enter a score of 75 to get a grade of C.\n* Enter a score of 65 to get a grade of D.\n* Enter a score of 55 to get a grade of F.",
