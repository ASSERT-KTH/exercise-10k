  "answer": "**Guessing Game Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a guessing game where the computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides a hint, indicating whether the user's guess is higher or lower than the computer's number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, I was thinking of number\", number_to_guess)\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in\", attempts, \"attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess.\n3. Enter a number between 1 and 100.\n4. The program will provide a hint, indicating whether the user's guess is higher or lower than the computer's number.\n5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n6. Type \"quit\" to give up and see the correct answer.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they guess the correct number or type \"quit\". The `random` module is used to generate a random number, and the `int` function is used to convert the user's input to an integer. The program also includes error handling to deal with invalid input.",
