  "answer": "**Budget Tracker Program**\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of a budget tracker program that allows users to add, remove, and track their expenses.\n\n### Code\n```python\nclass BudgetTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.expenses = {}\n        self.total_budget = 0\n        self.total_expenses = 0\n\n    def add_expense(self, name, amount):\n        \"\"\"Add a new expense to the tracker\"\"\"\n        self.expenses[name] = amount\n        self.total_expenses += amount\n        print(f\"Expense '{name}' added successfully.\")\n\n    def remove_expense(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Remove an existing expense from the tracker\"\"\"\n        if name in self.expenses:\n            amount = self.expenses[name]\n            del self.expenses[name]\n            self.total_expenses -= amount\n            print(f\"Expense '{name}' removed successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Expense '{name}' not found.\")\n\n    def set_budget(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"Set the total budget\"\"\"\n        self.total_budget = amount\n        print(f\"Budget set to ${amount:.2f}.\")\n\n    def track_expenses(self):\n        \"\"\"Print the current expenses and budget status\"\"\"\n        print(\"\\nCurrent Expenses:\")\n        for name, amount in self.expenses.items():\n            print(f\"{name}: ${amount:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"\\nTotal Expenses: ${self.total_expenses:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Total Budget: ${self.total_budget:.2f}\")\n        if self.total_expenses > self.total_budget:\n            print(\"You are over budget.\")\n        elif self.total_expenses < self.total_budget:\n            print(\"You are under budget.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"You are at budget.\")\n\ndef main():\n    tracker = BudgetTracker()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBudget Tracker Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Expense\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Expense\")\n        print(\"3. Set Budget\")\n        print(\"4. Track Expenses\")\n        print(\"5. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter expense name: \")\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter expense amount: $\"))\n            tracker.add_expense(name, amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter expense name: \")\n            tracker.remove_expense(name)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter budget amount: $\"))\n            tracker.set_budget(amount)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            tracker.track_expenses()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and select option 1 to add an expense.\n2. Enter the expense name and amount, and confirm that the expense is added successfully.\n3. Select option 3 to set the total budget.\n4. Enter the budget amount and confirm that the budget is set successfully.\n5. Select option 4 to track your expenses and see the current budget status.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5 to add, remove, and track expenses, and adjust the budget as needed.\n7. Select option 5 to quit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store expenses and does not persist data between sessions. For a more robust implementation, consider using a database or file storage.",
