  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 10 to 0 with a For Loop and Step -2**\n\nHere's an example program in Python that utilizes a for loop with a step of -2 to print the numbers from 10 to 0:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers():\n    # Use range function to generate numbers from 10 to 0 with a step of -2\n    for i in range(10, -1, -2):\n        print(i)\n\n# Call the function to print the numbers\nprint_numbers()\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n```\n\nNote that the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value. Therefore, we use `-1` as the end value to include `0` in the range.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `range(10, -1, -2)`: Generates numbers from 10 down to 0 with a step of -2.\n* `for i in range(...)`: Iterates over the generated numbers.\n* `print(i)`: Prints each number in the range.\n\nYou can run this program to see the output. The `print_numbers` function can be called multiple times to print the numbers from 10 to 0 with a step of -2.",
