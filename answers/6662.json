  "answer": "**Mode Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the mode of a list of numbers. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes (in case of a tie).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    frequency = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number.\n3. It finds the maximum frequency by using the `max` function on the values of the frequency dictionary.\n4. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency by using a list comprehension.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_mode` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the mode of a list of exam scores: `[85, 90, 90, 78, 90, 92, 88, 90]`\n* Calculate the mode of a list of product prices: `[10.99, 9.99, 10.99, 12.99, 10.99, 11.99]`\n* Calculate the mode of a list of survey responses: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`\n\nNote: This program returns all modes in case of a tie. If you want to return only one mode, you can modify the program to return the smallest or largest mode.",
