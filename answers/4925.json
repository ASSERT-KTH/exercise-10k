  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of student grades. The program should ask the user to enter a series of grades separated by spaces and then calculate the statistics.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_statistics():\n    # Get the grades from the user\n    grades = input(\"Enter a series of grades separated by spaces: \")\n\n    # Convert the input into a list of floats\n    try:\n        grades = [float(grade) for grade in grades.split()]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numbers separated by spaces.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = statistics.mean(grades)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = statistics.median(grades)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    if len(grades) > 1:\n        std_dev = statistics.stdev(grades)\n    else:\n        std_dev = 0\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculate_statistics()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We first import the `statistics` module which provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.\n2.  We define a function `calculate_statistics()` that will get the grades from the user, calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation, and then print the results.\n3.  Inside `calculate_statistics()`, we use the `input()` function to get a string of grades from the user. We then convert this string into a list of floats using a list comprehension. If the input cannot be converted into a list of floats (for example, if the user enters non-numeric characters), we catch the `ValueError` exception, print an error message, and return from the function.\n4.  We calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the grades using the `statistics.mean()`, `statistics.median()`, and `statistics.stdev()` functions, respectively. If there is only one grade, we set the standard deviation to 0 because the standard deviation of a single number is undefined.\n5.  Finally, we print the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n6.  The `main()` function calls `calculate_statistics()` to start the program.\n7.  The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported). If it is, it calls the `main()` function to start the program.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a series of grades separated by spaces. For example, if you enter `90 80 70 60 50`, the program will calculate and print the mean, median, and standard deviation of these grades.\n\n```\nEnter a series of grades separated by spaces: 90 80 70 60 50\nMean: 70.0\nMedian: 70.0\nStandard Deviation: 14.142135623730951\n```",
