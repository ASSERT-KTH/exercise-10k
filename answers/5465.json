  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef combine_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two lists into one.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list1 + list2\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\ncombined_list = combine_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `combine_lists` that takes two lists as arguments. Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists, creating a new list that contains all elements from both input lists. This new list is then returned by the function.\n\nThe example usage section demonstrates how to call the `combine_lists` function with two sample lists and print the resulting combined list.",
