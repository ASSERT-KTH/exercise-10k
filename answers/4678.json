  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two strings as input and returns the characters that are in exactly one of the strings.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef unique_chars(str1, str2):\n    set1 = set(str1)\n    set2 = set(str2)\n\n    unique_chars = (set1 - set2) | (set2 - set1)\n    return unique_chars\n\n# Test the function\nstr1 = \"hello\"\nstr2 = \"world\"\n\nunique_chars_set = unique_chars(str1, str2)\nprint(\"Characters in exactly one of the strings:\")\nfor char in unique_chars_set:\n    print(char)\n\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `unique_chars` that takes two strings as input.\n- We convert each string into a set of characters. This automatically removes any duplicate characters from each string.\n- We use the set difference operation `-` to get the characters that are in one set but not the other. We use the union operation `|` to combine these two sets of characters.\n- We return the set of unique characters.\n- We test the function with two example strings and print out the unique characters.\n\nNote: This solution is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want a case-insensitive solution or want to ignore spaces and punctuation, you would need to modify the code accordingly.",
