  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character in a String**\n\nThis program finds the first non-repeating character in a given string. It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each character and then iterates over the string to find the first character with a count of 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"aabbc\"\nprint(first_non_repeating_char(s))  # Output: c\n\ns = \"aabbcc\"\nprint(first_non_repeating_char(s))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Character Frequency Count**: The program starts by creating a dictionary `char_count` to store the frequency of each character in the string. It iterates over the string, incrementing the count for each character in the dictionary.\n2. **First Non-Repeating Character**: The program then iterates over the string again, checking the count of each character in the `char_count` dictionary. If it finds a character with a count of 1, it returns that character as the first non-repeating character.\n3. **No Non-Repeating Character**: If the program iterates over the entire string without finding a non-repeating character, it returns `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it iterates over the string twice: once to count the frequency of each character and again to find the first non-repeating character. The space complexity is also O(n), as the program stores the frequency of each character in a dictionary.",
