  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hypotenuse(a, b):\n    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n\ndef main():\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of side a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of side b: \"))\n\n    hypotenuse = calculate_hypotenuse(a, b)\n\n    print(f\"The length of the hypotenuse is: {hypotenuse:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program uses the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\n- It first asks the user to input the lengths of the two sides of the triangle.\n- Then it calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the `math.sqrt` function and the formula `a**2 + b**2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two sides.\n- Finally, it prints out the length of the hypotenuse, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf you input `3` for side `a` and `4` for side `b`, the program will output `5.00` as the length of the hypotenuse, because `3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25`, and `math.sqrt(25) = 5`.",
