  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses a for loop to find the maximum number in a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_number(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the maximum number in a list of numbers.\n\n    Parameters:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    max_number (int): The maximum number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return None\n\n    max_number = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > max_number:\n            max_number = num\n\n    return max_number\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    numbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7]\n    max_number = find_max_number(numbers)\n\n    if max_number is not None:\n        print(\"The maximum number in the list is:\", max_number)\n    else:\n        print(\"The list is empty.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How It Works**\n\n*   We define a function called `find_max_number` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   Inside the function, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return `None`.\n*   We then initialize a variable called `max_number` with the first number in the list.\n*   Next, we use a for loop to iterate over the numbers in the list. For each number, we check if it is greater than the current `max_number`. If it is, we update `max_number` with the new number.\n*   Finally, we return the `max_number` after the loop finishes.\n*   In the `main` function, we test `find_max_number` with a sample list of numbers and print the result.",
