  "answer": "**Password Generator**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python solution for a password generator that asks for user input and generates a random password based on the provided preferences.\n\n```python\nimport string\nimport secrets\n\ndef password_generator(length=12, use_uppercase=True, use_numbers=True, use_special_chars=True):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random password based on user input.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the password. Defaults to 12.\n        use_uppercase (bool): Whether to include uppercase letters. Defaults to True.\n        use_numbers (bool): Whether to include numbers. Defaults to True.\n        use_special_chars (bool): Whether to include special characters. Defaults to True.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The generated password.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the characters that can be included in the password\n    chars = string.ascii_lowercase\n    if use_uppercase:\n        chars += string.ascii_uppercase\n    if use_numbers:\n        chars += string.digits\n    if use_special_chars:\n        chars += string.punctuation\n\n    # Generate the password\n    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))\n\n    return password\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Password Generator\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n\n    # Ask for user input\n    length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the password (default=12): \") or 12)\n    use_uppercase = input(\"Include uppercase letters? (y/n, default=y): \").lower() != 'n'\n    use_numbers = input(\"Include numbers? (y/n, default=y): \").lower() != 'n'\n    use_special_chars = input(\"Include special characters? (y/n, default=y): \").lower() != 'n'\n\n    # Generate and print the password\n    password = password_generator(length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special_chars)\n    print(\"Generated Password : \", password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\nTo use this password generator, simply run the script and follow the prompts. You will be asked for the length of the password, and whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password will then be printed to the console.\n\n**Security Note:**\nThis password generator uses the `secrets` module, which is designed to generate cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. This makes it suitable for generating passwords that need to be secure.",
