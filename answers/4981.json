  "answer": "**Variable Declaration and Assignment**\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable named 'age' of type integer and assign it the value 25\nage: int = 25\n```\n\nThis code declares a variable named `age` with a type hint of `int` (integer) and assigns it the value `25`. The type hint is not enforced at runtime but is useful for static type checkers and IDEs to provide better code completion and error detection.",
