  "prompt": "Create a function that takes in a dictionary of student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary of grades. This function will return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and lists of grades as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades for each student\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Calculate the sum of all grades for the current student\n        total_grade = sum(grades)\n        \n        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades\n        average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n        \n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with average grades for each student\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    \"John\": [90, 85, 95],\n    \"Alice\": [88, 92, 89],\n    \"Bob\": [76, 82, 81]\n}\n\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(grades)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_average_grades` initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grades for each student.\n*   It then iterates over each student in the input dictionary `grades_dict`, calculating the sum of all grades for the current student using `sum(grades)` and the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades `len(grades)`.\n*   The average grade is stored in the `average_grades` dictionary with the student's name as the key.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary, providing the average grades for each student.",
