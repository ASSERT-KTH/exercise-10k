  "answer": "### Finding the Index of an Element in a List\n\nHere's a Python function that will find the index of a given element in a list. If the element is not found, it will return -1.\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of a given element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to search.\n        element: The element to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(element)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_index(my_list, 3))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_index(my_list, 6))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `find_index` that takes a list `lst` and an `element` as arguments.\n*   The `index` method of the list is used to find the index of the element. If the element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised.\n*   We catch the `ValueError` exception and return -1 if the element is not found.\n*   The function is demonstrated with an example list and elements.\n\nNote: This function returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. If the list contains duplicate elements and you want to find the indices of all occurrences, you would need to use a different approach, such as a loop or list comprehension.",
