  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of integers and a threshold value as input, and returns a new list containing only the integers greater than the threshold.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Create a list of integers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# Define an integer threshold value\nthreshold = 5\n\n# Use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers greater than the threshold\ngreater_than_threshold = [n for n in numbers if n > threshold]\n\n# Print the resulting list\nprint(greater_than_threshold)\n```\nThis code should output: `[6, 7, 8, 9]`",
