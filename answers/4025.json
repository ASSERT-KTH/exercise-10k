  "answer": "**Insertion Sort Implementation**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nInsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. Each subsequent element from the unsorted region is inserted into the sorted region in its correct position.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        # Store the current element to be inserted\n        current_element = arr[i]\n        # Initialize the index of the previous element\n        j = i - 1\n        \n        # Shift elements in the sorted region to make room for the current element\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > current_element:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        \n        # Insert the current element into the sorted region\n        arr[j + 1] = current_element\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `insertion_sort` function takes an array as input and iterates over it starting from the second element (index 1).\n2.  For each element, it stores the current element to be inserted and initializes the index of the previous element (`j`).\n3.  It shifts elements in the sorted region to make room for the current element by comparing and swapping elements until it finds the correct position for the current element.\n4.  Once the correct position is found, it inserts the current element into the sorted region.\n5.  The process continues until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case: O(n) when the input array is already sorted\n*   Average-case: O(n^2) for random input arrays\n*   Worst-case: O(n^2) when the input array is reverse sorted\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   O(1) since insertion sort only uses a constant amount of additional space for variables.",
