  "answer": "**Average Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a set of numbers input by the user.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of values from the user\n    num_values = int(input(\"Enter the number of values: \"))\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the numbers\n    numbers = []\n\n    # Get the numbers from the user\n    for i in range(num_values):\n        num = float(input(f\"Enter number {i+1}: \"))\n        numbers.append(num)\n\n    # Calculate and print the average\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average is: {average:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of values you want to calculate the average for (e.g., 3).\n3. Enter each number individually (e.g., 10, 20, 30).\n4. The program will print the average of the input numbers (e.g., 20.00).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple formula to calculate the average: `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`.\n* The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average as a float.\n* The `main` function handles user input and output.\n* The program uses a `for` loop to get the numbers from the user and store them in a list.",
