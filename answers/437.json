  "answer": "### Consonant Counter Program\n#### Description\nThis program asks the user for a string and prints out the number of consonants in it.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef count_consonants(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of consonants in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count consonants from.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of consonants in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    consonant_count = 0\n\n    for char in input_string.lower():\n        if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:\n            consonant_count += 1\n\n    return consonant_count\n\n\ndef main():\n    user_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    consonant_count = count_consonants(user_string)\n    print(f\"The string '{user_string}' contains {consonant_count} consonants.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The `count_consonants` function takes an input string, converts it to lowercase, and iterates over each character.\n2. It checks if the character is an alphabet letter and not a vowel. If both conditions are true, it increments the consonant count.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for a string, calls the `count_consonants` function, and prints out the result.\n\n#### Example Usage\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a string. For example, if you enter \"Hello, World!\", it will print out the number of consonants in that string. Note that punctuation and spaces are not considered consonants.",
