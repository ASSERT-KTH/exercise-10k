  "answer": "**Longest Word Finder Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and finds the longest word in it.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_word(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest word in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest word in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Initialize the longest word and its length\n    longest_word = \"\"\n    max_length = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation from the word\n        clean_word = \"\".join(e for e in word if e.isalnum()).lower()\n\n        # Check if the current word is longer than the longest word found so far\n        if len(clean_word) > max_length:\n            # Update the longest word and its length\n            longest_word = word\n            max_length = len(clean_word)\n\n    return longest_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"This is a sample string with multiple words.\"\n    longest_word = find_longest_word(input_string)\n    print(f\"The longest word is: {longest_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_longest_word` function takes a string as input and splits it into words using the `split` method.\n2. It initializes the longest word and its length to empty string and 0, respectively.\n3. It then iterates over each word in the list of words, removing punctuation from the word using a list comprehension.\n4. If the current word is longer than the longest word found so far, it updates the longest word and its length.\n5. Finally, it returns the longest word.\n6. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `find_longest_word` function with an example string.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program considers words with punctuation as separate words. For example, \"word\" and \"word.\" are considered different words.\n* If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, this program returns the first one it encounters. If you want to return all words with the maximum length, you can modify the program to store the longest words in a list instead of a single variable.",
