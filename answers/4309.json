  "answer": "### Retrieving a Dictionary Value by Key\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following Python function, `get_dict_value`, takes a dictionary and a key as input and returns the value associated with the key. If the key is not found in the dictionary, it returns `None`.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef get_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key (any): The key to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the key, or None if the key is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dictionary.get(key)\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Output: John\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"country\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n* The function uses the built-in `get` method of Python dictionaries, which returns the value for a given key if it exists in the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it returns `None` by default.\n* The function takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `key`, which are used to call the `get` method.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample dictionary, retrieving both an existing and a non-existing key.",
