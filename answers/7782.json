  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, both of which are integers.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef calculateEvenSum(start, end):\n    evenSum = 0\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            evenSum += i\n    return evenSum\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculateEvenSum(1, 10))  # Output: 30\n```\nThis code defines a function `calculateEvenSum` that takes two integer parameters `start` and `end`, and returns the sum of all even numbers in the range `[start, end]`. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range, and for each even number, it adds it to the `evenSum` variable. Finally, it returns the `evenSum` value.\n\nNote that I've used the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from `start` to `end` (inclusive), and the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is even. I've also included an example usage of the function to demonstrate its behavior.",
