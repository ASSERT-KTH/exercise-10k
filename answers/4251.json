  "answer": "**Student Grade Book Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows users to maintain a student's grade book by adding grades for assignments and calculating the average grade.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass StudentGradeBook:\n    def __init__(self, student_name):\n        self.student_name = student_name\n        self.grades = []\n\n    def add_grade(self, assignment_name, grade):\n        \"\"\"Add a grade for an assignment\"\"\"\n        self.grades.append((assignment_name, grade))\n\n    def calculate_average_grade(self):\n        \"\"\"Calculate the average grade\"\"\"\n        if not self.grades:\n            return 0\n        total_grade = sum(grade for _, grade in self.grades)\n        return total_grade / len(self.grades)\n\n    def print_grades(self):\n        \"\"\"Print all grades\"\"\"\n        print(f\"Grades for {self.student_name}:\")\n        for assignment_name, grade in self.grades:\n            print(f\"{assignment_name}: {grade}\")\n\n    def print_average_grade(self):\n        \"\"\"Print the average grade\"\"\"\n        average_grade = self.calculate_average_grade()\n        print(f\"Average grade for {self.student_name}: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    student_name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    grade_book = StudentGradeBook(student_name)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Add grade\")\n        print(\"2. Print grades\")\n        print(\"3. Print average grade\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        option = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if option == \"1\":\n            assignment_name = input(\"Enter the assignment name: \")\n            grade = float(input(\"Enter the grade: \"))\n            grade_book.add_grade(assignment_name, grade)\n        elif option == \"2\":\n            grade_book.print_grades()\n        elif option == \"3\":\n            grade_book.print_average_grade()\n        elif option == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a `StudentGradeBook` class with methods to add grades, calculate the average grade, and print grades.\n2. The `add_grade` method adds a grade for an assignment to the `grades` list.\n3. The `calculate_average_grade` method calculates the average grade by summing all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n4. The `print_grades` method prints all grades for the student.\n5. The `print_average_grade` method prints the average grade for the student.\n6. The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the student's name.\n2. Choose option 1 to add a grade for an assignment. Enter the assignment name and grade.\n3. Choose option 2 to print all grades for the student.\n4. Choose option 3 to print the average grade for the student.\n5. Choose option 4 to exit the program.",
