  "prompt": "Write a program that demonstrates the use of different numeric data types, including integers and floating-point numbers.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided specification, I will write the code in Python. Here it is:\n\n```python\n# Define a variable named age and assign it the value 18\nage = 18\n\n# Create a floating-point number by dividing 18 by 3\nfloating_point_number = 18 / 3\n\n# Print the value of age and floating_point_number\nprint(age, floating_point_number)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `age` variable with the value 18, creates a floating-point number by dividing 18 by 3, and prints both values to the console. The output will be:\n\n```\n18 6.0\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates the use of integers and floating-point numbers in Python. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
