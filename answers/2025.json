  "answer": "**Student Status Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program determines a student's status based on their attendance and grades. The program uses if/else statements to evaluate the student's attendance and grades and assign a status.\n\n**Program Code**\n```python\ndef calculate_student_status(attendance, grade):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a student's status based on their attendance and grade.\n\n    Args:\n        attendance (float): The student's attendance percentage.\n        grade (float): The student's grade percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's status.\n    \"\"\"\n    if attendance < 80:\n        return \"Probation\"\n    elif grade < 50:\n        return \"Failed\"\n    elif grade >= 80 and attendance >= 90:\n        return \"Honors\"\n    elif grade >= 70 and attendance >= 80:\n        return \"Pass\"\n    else:\n        return \"Warning\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    attendance = float(input(\"Enter the student's attendance percentage: \"))\n    grade = float(input(\"Enter the student's grade percentage: \"))\n    status = calculate_student_status(attendance, grade)\n    print(f\"The student's status is: {status}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `calculate_student_status` function takes two arguments: `attendance` and `grade`, which represent the student's attendance and grade percentages, respectively.\n2. The function uses if/else statements to evaluate the student's attendance and grade and assign a status.\n3. The possible statuses are:\n\t* `Probation`: If the student's attendance is less than 80%.\n\t* `Failed`: If the student's grade is less than 50%.\n\t* `Honors`: If the student's grade is 80% or higher and their attendance is 90% or higher.\n\t* `Pass`: If the student's grade is 70% or higher and their attendance is 80% or higher.\n\t* `Warning`: If the student's attendance and grade do not meet the above criteria.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the student's attendance and grade percentages, calculates the student's status using the `calculate_student_status` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* If the student's attendance is 75% and their grade is 60%, the program will output: `The student's status is: Warning`\n* If the student's attendance is 95% and their grade is 85%, the program will output: `The student's status is: Honors`\n* If the student's attendance is 60% and their grade is 40%, the program will output: `The student's status is: Probation`",
