  "answer": "**Geometric Sequence Generator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a geometric sequence up to a given term. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef geometric_sequence(a, r, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a geometric sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        a (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        r (float): The common ratio of the sequence.\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the first n terms of the geometric sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [a]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] * r)\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    a = 2  # First term\n    r = 3  # Common ratio\n    n = 10  # Number of terms\n\n    sequence = geometric_sequence(a, r, n)\n    print(\"Geometric Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `geometric_sequence` function takes three arguments: `a` (the first term), `r` (the common ratio), and `n` (the number of terms).\n2. The function initializes a list `sequence` with the first term `a`.\n3. The function then uses a loop to generate the remaining terms of the sequence, multiplying each previous term by the common ratio `r`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `geometric_sequence` function.\n5. The program prints the generated geometric sequence to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nGeometric Sequence:\n[2, 6, 18, 54, 162, 486, 1458, 4374, 13122, 39366]\n```\n\nThis output shows the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence with a first term of 2 and a common ratio of 3.",
