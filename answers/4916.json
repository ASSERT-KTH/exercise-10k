  "prompt": "Write a program that asks a user to take a simple survey and prints the result. The survey should ask the user to rate their satisfaction (1-5) and print whether they are satisfied (4-5) or not.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef survey():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user to rate their satisfaction and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Simple Satisfaction Survey\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    # Ask the user for their satisfaction rating\n    while True:\n        try:\n            rating = int(input(\"Please rate your satisfaction (1-5): \"))\n            if 1 <= rating <= 5:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid rating. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\n    # Print the result\n    if rating >= 4:\n        print(f\"You are satisfied with a rating of {rating}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"You are not satisfied with a rating of {rating}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    survey()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The `survey` function is defined to contain the survey logic.\n2. The user is prompted to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1-5.\n3. The program checks if the user's input is a valid whole number between 1 and 5. If not, it asks the user to try again.\n4. Once a valid rating is entered, the program checks if the rating is 4 or 5. If so, it prints that the user is satisfied. Otherwise, it prints that the user is not satisfied.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block calls the `survey` function when the program is run directly.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* A user enters a rating of 4 or 5, and the program prints that they are satisfied.\n* A user enters a rating of 1, 2, or 3, and the program prints that they are not satisfied.\n* A user enters an invalid input (e.g., a string or a number outside the range of 1-5), and the program asks them to try again.",
