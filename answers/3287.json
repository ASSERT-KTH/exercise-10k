  "answer": "**Guessing Game Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program plays a guessing game with the user. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.\n3. Enter your guess, and the program will tell you if it's higher or lower than the actual number.\n4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle invalid user input (e.g., non-integer values) to prevent the program from crashing.\n* Use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they find the correct number.\n* Keep track of the number of attempts to provide feedback to the user.",
