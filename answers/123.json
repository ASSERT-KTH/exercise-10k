  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two integers as input and outputs their division and remainder.\n\n```python\ndef divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the division and remainder of two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the quotient and remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    quotient = dividend // divisor\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n\n    return quotient, remainder\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two integers from the user\n    dividend = int(input(\"Enter the dividend: \"))\n    divisor = int(input(\"Enter the divisor: \"))\n\n    try:\n        quotient, remainder = divide_and_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n        print(f\"{dividend} divided by {divisor} is {quotient} with a remainder of {remainder}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `divide_and_remainder` function takes two integers as input and returns their division and remainder. The `main` function gets the two integers from the user, calls `divide_and_remainder`, and prints the result. If the user tries to divide by zero, it catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.",
