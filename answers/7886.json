  "prompt": "Create a program that implements a basic calculator. It should take a string input representing a mathematical operation, such as '2 + 3' or '5 * 2', and output the result of that operation. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate(operation):\n    try:\n        return eval(operation)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Calculator\")\n    print(\"Operations supported: +, -, *, /\")\n    while True:\n        operation = input(\"Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        if operation.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        print(f\"Result: {calculate(operation)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses the built-in `eval` function in Python, which parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.\n\nHowever, be aware that using `eval` can pose a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input, because it can evaluate any Python expression. In this case, since we're only using it to evaluate basic mathematical expressions, the risk is minimal.\n\nFor a more secure solution, you could use a library like `numexpr` or `asteval`, which are designed to safely evaluate mathematical expressions.\n\nHere's an example using `numexpr`:\n\n```python\nimport numexpr as ne\n\ndef calculate(operation):\n    try:\n        return ne.evaluate(operation)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Calculator\")\n    print(\"Operations supported: +, -, *, /\")\n    while True:\n        operation = input(\"Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        if operation.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        print(f\"Result: {calculate(operation)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nAnd here's an example using `asteval`:\n\n```python\nfrom asteval import Interpreter\n\ndef calculate(operation):\n    aeval = Interpreter()\n    try:\n        return aeval(operation)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Calculator\")\n    print(\"Operations supported: +, -, *, /\")\n    while True:\n        operation = input(\"Enter an operation (or 'q' to quit): \")\n        if operation.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        print(f\"Result: {calculate(operation)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
