  "answer": "**Story Blank Filler Program**\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a story with blank spaces as input and fills in the blanks with words provided by the user. The story is then printed out with the blanks filled.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef fill_blanks(story, words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fill in the blanks in the story with the provided words.\n\n    Args:\n    story (str): The story with blank spaces.\n    words (list): A list of words to fill in the blanks.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The story with the blanks filled.\n    \"\"\"\n    filled_story = story\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        filled_story = filled_story.replace(f\"{{{i}}}\", word, 1)\n    return filled_story\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the story from the user\n    story = input(\"Enter a story with blank spaces (use {} to represent a blank): \")\n\n    # Get the words from the user\n    num_blanks = story.count(\"{}\")\n    words = []\n    for i in range(num_blanks):\n        word = input(f\"Enter word {i+1}: \")\n        words.append(word)\n\n    # Fill in the blanks\n    filled_story = fill_blanks(story, words)\n\n    # Print the filled story\n    print(\"Filled Story:\")\n    print(filled_story)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter a story with blank spaces when prompted. For example: \"Once upon a time, there was a {} who loved to {}.\"\n2. Enter the words to fill in the blanks when prompted. For example:\n   * Enter word 1: princess\n   * Enter word 2: dance\n3. The program will print out the story with the blanks filled. For example:\n   * Filled Story:\n     Once upon a time, there was a princess who loved to dance.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses the `{}` character to represent a blank in the story.\n* The program replaces each blank with the corresponding word provided by the user.\n* The program only replaces the first occurrence of each blank, so if there are multiple blanks with the same index, only the first one will be replaced.",
