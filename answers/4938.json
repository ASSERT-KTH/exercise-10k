  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years. The program should use the formula compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate) ** years to calculate the compound interest.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n# Title: Compound Interest Calculator\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Creation Date: [Today's Date]\n# Python Version: 3.9\n\ndef compound_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The initial amount of money\n        rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 5% = 0.05)\n        years (int): The number of years the money is invested for\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + rate) ** years\n\n# Example usage:\np = 1000\nr = 0.05\ny = 5\n\nresult = compound_interest(p, r, y)\nprint(f\"The compound interest is: {result:.2f}\")\n```\nI've included the `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` line to specify the encoding, as well as the comments with metadata about the program. The code defines the `compound_interest` function, which takes the `principal`, `rate`, and `years` arguments and returns the compound interest. I've also included an example usage of the function, which calculates the compound interest for a principal of $1000, an interest rate of 5%, and a period of 5 years.",
