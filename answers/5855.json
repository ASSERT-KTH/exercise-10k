  "answer": "**Animal Guessing Game**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of the animal guessing game:\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of animals with their average weights (in kg)\nanimals = {\n    \"mouse\": 0.02,\n    \"cat\": 4.5,\n    \"dog\": 15,\n    \"cow\": 400,\n    \"elephant\": 5000,\n    \"giraffe\": 830,\n    \"lion\": 190,\n    \"tiger\": 260\n}\n\ndef get_animal():\n    \"\"\"Return a random animal from the list\"\"\"\n    return random.choice(list(animals.keys()))\n\ndef get_hint(guess, target):\n    \"\"\"Return a hint based on the guess\"\"\"\n    if animals[guess] < animals[target]:\n        return \"too small\"\n    elif animals[guess] > animals[target]:\n        return \"too big\"\n    else:\n        return \"correct\"\n\ndef game():\n    \"\"\"Play the animal guessing game\"\"\"\n    target_animal = get_animal()\n    print(\"I'm thinking of an animal. Try to guess it!\")\n    \n    while True:\n        guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \").lower()\n        \n        if guess not in animals:\n            print(\"Invalid animal. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        \n        hint = get_hint(guess, target_animal)\n        print(hint)\n        \n        if hint == \"correct\":\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the animal: {target_animal}\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n**How to Play**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will think of an animal and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess (e.g., \"cat\", \"dog\", etc.).\n4. The program will give you a hint based on your guess (e.g., \"too big\", \"too small\", \"correct\").\n5. Keep guessing until you guess the animal correctly.\n\nNote: The program uses a simple weight-based comparison to determine the hints. The weights are approximate and may vary depending on the specific breed or species.",
