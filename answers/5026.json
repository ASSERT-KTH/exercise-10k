  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks if a given string is a palindrome using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum()).lower()  # remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\n    left = 0\n    right = len(s) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        if s[left] != s[right]:\n            return False\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return True\n\n# Test the function\nprint(is_palindrome(\"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\"))  # True\nprint(is_palindrome(\"Hello\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_palindrome` function first preprocesses the input string `s` by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase.\n2. It then initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the string respectively.\n3. The while loop compares the characters at the `left` and `right` indices. If they are not equal, the function immediately returns `False`.\n4. If the characters are equal, the `left` pointer is incremented and the `right` pointer is decremented, effectively moving them towards the center of the string.\n5. If the while loop completes without finding any unequal characters, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst case, we are scanning the entire string once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the string preprocessing step.",
