  "prompt": "Write a program that checks the scope of a given variable.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that demonstrates the scope of variables:\n\n```python\n# Global scope\nx = 10\n\ndef outer_function():\n    # Enclosing scope\n    y = 20\n\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local scope\n        z = 30\n        print(\"Inside inner_function:\")\n        print(\"x (global):\", x)\n        print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n        print(\"z (local):\", z)\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(\"Inside outer_function:\")\n    print(\"x (global):\", x)\n    print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)\n    # print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise an error\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global scope:\")\nprint(\"x (global):\", x)\n# print(\"y (enclosing):\", y)  # This would raise an error\n# print(\"z (local):\", z)  # This would raise an error\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates the LEGB rule, which stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in. The Python interpreter follows this order to resolve the scope of variables:\n\n1.  **Local**: The innermost scope, which is the current function or method.\n2.  **Enclosing**: The scope of the outer function or method, if it exists.\n3.  **Global**: The global scope, which is the top-level scope of the program.\n4.  **Built-in**: The built-in scope, which contains built-in functions and variables.\n\nIn this example, `x` is a global variable, `y` is an enclosing variable, and `z` is a local variable within the `inner_function`. The program prints the values of these variables from different scopes to demonstrate the LEGB rule.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nInside inner_function:\nx (global): 10\ny (enclosing): 20\nz (local): 30\nInside outer_function:\nx (global): 10\ny (enclosing): 20\nGlobal scope:\nx (global): 10\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `inner_function` has access to its local scope (`z`), the enclosing scope of `outer_function` (`y`), and the global scope (`x`).\n*   The `outer_function` has access to its enclosing scope (`y`) and the global scope (`x`), but not the local scope of `inner_function` (`z`).\n*   The global scope has access only to the global variable (`x`), not the enclosing or local variables (`y` and `z`).",
