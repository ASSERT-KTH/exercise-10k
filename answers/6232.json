  "answer": "### Rotating a List to the Right\n#### Function Description\n\nThe function `rotate_list` takes a list and an integer `k` as input, and returns the list rotated `k` positions to the right.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef rotate_list(lst, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate a list to the right by k positions.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list to be rotated.\n        k (int): The number of positions to rotate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated list.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = k % len(lst)  # Handle cases where k is greater than the list length\n    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    k = 2\n    print(\"Original List:\", lst)\n    print(\"Rotated List:\", rotate_list(lst, k))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n* The function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts at the specified position.\n* The expression `lst[-k:]` gets the last `k` elements of the list, and `lst[:-k]` gets all elements except the last `k` elements.\n* The two parts are then concatenated in reverse order to achieve the rotation effect.\n* The line `k = k % len(lst)` ensures that the rotation works correctly even when `k` is greater than the length of the list. This is because rotating a list of length `n` by `n` positions is equivalent to not rotating it at all, and rotating it by `n+1` positions is equivalent to rotating it by 1 position.",
