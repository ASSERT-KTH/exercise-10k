  "answer": "**Mathematical Expression Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a mathematical expression as input from the user and calculates the result. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expression(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\n\n    Args:\n        expression (str): The mathematical expression to be evaluated.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use eval() to evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Mathematical Expression Calculator\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n\n    while True:\n        expression = input(\"Enter a mathematical expression (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if expression.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        result = calculate_expression(expression)\n        if result is not None:\n            print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculate the sum of two numbers: `2 + 3`\n*   Calculate the difference of two numbers: `5 - 2`\n*   Calculate the product of two numbers: `4 * 5`\n*   Calculate the quotient of two numbers: `10 / 2`\n\n### Notes\n\n*   The `eval()` function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression. This function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input, as it can evaluate any Python expression. In this case, we are assuming that the input is from a trusted source (the user).\n*   The program handles division by zero and other exceptions that may occur during the evaluation of the expression.\n*   The program runs in an infinite loop until the user types 'quit' to exit.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter a mathematical expression and view the result.",
