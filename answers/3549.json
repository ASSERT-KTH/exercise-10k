  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a partition size as input, and returns a new array containing the partitioned sub-arrays.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\nfunction chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {\n  var newArr = [];\n  var i = 0;\n  while (i < arr.length) {\n    newArr.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));\n    i += size;\n  }\n  return newArr;\n}\n\nchunkArrayInGroups([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2);\n```\nNote that I've written the code in JavaScript, as it seems to be the most likely language based on the syntax and the use of the `slice()` method. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the code!",
