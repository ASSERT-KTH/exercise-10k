  "prompt": "Write a function to create a dictionary from a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that converts a list of tuples into a dictionary, where each tuple represents a key-value pair. This function will help you efficiently manage and transform your data. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef create_dict(tuple_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a dictionary from a list of tuples, \n    where each tuple contains a key-value pair.\n\n    Args:\n        tuple_list (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary created from the list of tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs\n    result_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        \n        # Check if the tuple has exactly two elements (key and value)\n        if len(tup) == 2:\n            \n            # Extract the key and value from the tuple\n            key, value = tup\n            \n            # Add the key-value pair to the dictionary\n            result_dict[key] = value\n        \n        # If the tuple does not have exactly two elements, raise a ValueError\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Each tuple must have exactly two elements\")\n\n    # Return the created dictionary\n    return result_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ntuple_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\nprint(create_dict(tuple_list))  # Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `create_dict` initializes an empty dictionary `result_dict` to store the key-value pairs from the input list of tuples `tuple_list`.\n*   It iterates over each tuple in `tuple_list`, checks if the tuple has exactly two elements (key and value), and extracts the key and value using tuple unpacking (`key, value = tup`).\n*   The key-value pair is then added to `result_dict`. If a tuple does not have exactly two elements, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   Finally, the function returns the created dictionary `result_dict`.",
