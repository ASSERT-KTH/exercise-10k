  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is prime or not.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns False.\n3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` by using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).\n5. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means `n` is not prime, so the function returns False.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns True, indicating that `n` is prime.\n7. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number, and the `is_prime` function is called with the input number.\n8. The result is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 25\n  Output: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Input: 23\n  Output: 23 is a prime number.\n* Input: 37\n  Output: 37 is a prime number.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to medium-sized integers. For larger integers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
