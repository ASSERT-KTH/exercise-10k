  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for a number and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_number():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for a number and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.\"\"\"\n    num = float(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n\n    if num > 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is a positive number.\")\n    elif num < 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is a negative number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is zero.\")\n\ndef main():\n    check_number()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `check_number` function prompts the user to enter a number using `input`. It converts the input to a `float` to handle decimal numbers.\n2. It uses an `if-elif-else` statement to check the number:\n    - If `num` is greater than 0, it prints that the number is positive.\n    - If `num` is less than 0, it prints that the number is negative.\n    - If `num` is neither positive nor negative, it must be 0, so it prints that the number is zero.\n3. The `main` function calls `check_number` to start the program.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line ensures that `main` is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n- Enter a positive number: `5`\n    Output: `5.0 is a positive number.`\n- Enter a negative number: `-3`\n    Output: `-3.0 is a negative number.`\n- Enter zero: `0`\n    Output: `0.0 is zero.`",
