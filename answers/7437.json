  "prompt": "Create a program that asks for a student's grade and checks if it is passing (60 or above) or failing. If the grade is passing, print 'Passing', otherwise print 'Failing'. Additionally, check if the grade is an A (90 or above), B (80-89), C (70-79), or D (60-69) and print the corresponding letter grade.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for a student's grade and checks if it is passing or failing.\n    If the grade is passing, prints 'Passing', otherwise prints 'Failing'.\n    Additionally, checks the letter grade (A, B, C, D) and prints it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask for the student's grade\n    while True:\n        try:\n            grade = float(input(\"Please enter the student's grade: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Check if the grade is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if grade < 0 or grade > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid grade. Grade should be between 0 and 100.\")\n    else:\n        # Check if the grade is passing or failing\n        if grade >= 60:\n            print(\"Passing\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Failing\")\n\n        # Check the letter grade\n        if grade >= 90:\n            print(\"Letter Grade: A\")\n        elif grade >= 80:\n            print(\"Letter Grade: B\")\n        elif grade >= 70:\n            print(\"Letter Grade: C\")\n        elif grade >= 60:\n            print(\"Letter Grade: D\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_grade()\n```\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the student's grade when prompted. The program will then print whether the grade is passing or failing and the corresponding letter grade. If the input is not a valid number, the program will ask for the input again. If the grade is not between 0 and 100, the program will print an error message.",
