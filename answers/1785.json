  "prompt": "Create a function to delete a given key from a dictionary, handling the case where the key does not exist.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that deletes a given key from a dictionary and handles the case where the key does not exist. This function will ensure that the dictionary remains unchanged if the key is not found. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef delete_key(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes a given key from a dictionary. If the key does not exist, \n    the dictionary remains unchanged.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to delete the key from.\n        key (any): The key to be deleted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The updated dictionary after deletion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary\n    if key in dictionary:\n        # If the key exists, we use the del statement to remove it from the dictionary\n        del dictionary[key]\n    \n    # Regardless of whether the key existed or not, we return the dictionary\n    # This could be the original dictionary if the key didn't exist, or the updated dictionary if it did\n    return dictionary\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nprint(delete_key(my_dict, 'b'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\nprint(delete_key(my_dict, 'd'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `delete_key` checks if a given `key` exists in the `dictionary` using the `in` operator. If the key exists, it proceeds with the deletion.\n* The `del` statement is used to remove the `key` from the `dictionary`. This operation modifies the original dictionary.\n* Regardless of whether the `key` existed or not, the function returns the `dictionary`. If the key did not exist, the returned dictionary remains unchanged.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the `delete_key` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict` and keys 'b' and 'd'.",
