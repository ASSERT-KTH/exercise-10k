  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The program should use conditional statements to determine the grade. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'. If the score is below 60, the grade is 'F'.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to determine the grade\ndef determine_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Define the main function\ndef main():\n    score = 88  # Test score\n    grade = determine_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The grade is {grade}\")\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code defines the `determine_grade` function, which takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the conditional statements. The `main` function defines a test score, calls the `determine_grade` function, and prints the result to the console. Finally, the `main` function is called to run the program.",
