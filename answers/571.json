  "answer": "**Character Frequency Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the frequency of each character in a given string and returns a dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    input_string (str): The input string for which character frequencies are to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency = calculate_character_frequency(input_str)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, freq in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {freq}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the frequency of each character.\n2. Iterate over each character in the `input_string`.\n3. If the character is already in `frequency_dict`, increment its frequency by 1.\n4. If the character is not in `frequency_dict`, add it with a frequency of 1.\n5. Return `frequency_dict` containing the frequency of each character.\n\n### Alternative Solution Using Python's Built-in `Counter` Class\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    input_string (str): The input string for which character frequencies are to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(Counter(input_string))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    input_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n    frequency = calculate_character_frequency(input_str)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, freq in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {freq}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis alternative solution uses Python's built-in `Counter` class from the `collections` module to calculate the frequency of each character in a more concise way.",
