  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program in Python that accomplishes that task:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num1 (int or float): The first number.\n    num2 (int or float): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int or float: The sum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum_of_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user to input two numbers using the built-in `input` function in Python. The inputs are converted to `float` to allow for both integer and decimal numbers.\n2. **Addition Function**: The `add_numbers` function takes these two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.\n3. **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the program's flow. It calls `add_numbers` with the user-provided numbers and then prints the result.\n4. **Execution**: The program starts execution from the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, ensuring the `main` function runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n- Run the program.\n- When prompted, enter the first number, for example, `5`.\n- Enter the second number, for example, `7`.\n- The program will output: `The sum of 5.0 and 7.0 is 12.0`.",
