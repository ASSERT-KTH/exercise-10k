  "answer": "**Unique Numbers Printer**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that prints a set of unique numbers from 1 to 10 to the screen.\n\n```python\ndef print_unique_numbers(start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a set of unique numbers from start to end.\n\n    Args:\n        start (int): The starting number.\n        end (int): The ending number.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_numbers = set(range(start, end + 1))\n    print(\"Unique numbers from {} to {}:\".format(start, end))\n    print(unique_numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    start = 1\n    end = 10\n    print_unique_numbers(start, end)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nUnique numbers from 1 to 10:\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `print_unique_numbers` function takes two arguments: `start` and `end`, which define the range of numbers to print.\n2. The `set` function is used to create a set of unique numbers from `start` to `end` (inclusive).\n3. The `print` function is used to display the set of unique numbers.\n4. In the `main` function, we call `print_unique_numbers` with `start` set to 1 and `end` set to 10.\n\n**Note:** Since we're using a set, the order of the numbers is not guaranteed. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a list instead.",
