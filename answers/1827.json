  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the sum of elements at even indices in a given array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the sum of elements at even indices in a given array:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_indices(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of elements at even indices in a given array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of elements at even indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)) if i % 2 == 0)\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = sum_even_indices(arr)\nprint(\"Sum of elements at even indices:\", result)\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `sum_even_indices` function takes a list `arr` as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the array, checking if each index is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).\n3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the elements at the even indices.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n* Output: `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`\n\nNote: In Python, array indices start at 0, so the even indices are 0, 2, 4, and so on.",
