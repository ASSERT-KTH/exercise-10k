  "answer": "**Multiple Choice Quiz Program**\n\nBelow is a Python program that presents the user with a series of multiple-choice questions and keeps track of their score.\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"Which planet is the largest in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"Answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"Answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest mammal on Earth?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Blue whale\",\n        \"B\": \"Fin whale\",\n        \"C\": \"Humpback whale\",\n        \"D\": \"Sperm whale\",\n        \"Answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the questions\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"Answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter the correct option (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"Answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct answer!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect answer. The correct answer was {options['Answer']}\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz finished! Your final score is {score}/{len(questions)}\")\n\n# Run the quiz\nquiz()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1.  The program defines a dictionary called `questions` where each key is a question and the corresponding value is another dictionary containing the options and the correct answer.\n2.  The `quiz` function initializes the score to 0 and then iterates over the questions in the `questions` dictionary.\n3.  For each question, it prints the question and the options, and then prompts the user to enter the correct option.\n4.  If the user's answer matches the correct answer, it increments the score and prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message with the correct answer.\n5.  After all questions have been asked, the program prints the final score.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the `quiz` function. The program will guide the user through the quiz, asking each question and keeping track of the score. At the end of the quiz, it will display the final score.",
