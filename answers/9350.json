  "answer": "**Variable Closure Demonstration**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nVariable closure is a fundamental concept in programming where a function has access to its own local variables, as well as the variables of its outer scope. This program demonstrates the concept of variable closure using Python.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(outer_variable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Outer function that returns an inner function with access to its variables.\n    \n    Args:\n        outer_variable: The variable from the outer scope.\n    \n    Returns:\n        A function with access to the outer_variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    def inner_function(inner_variable):\n        \"\"\"\n        Inner function that has access to the outer_variable and its own local variables.\n        \n        Args:\n            inner_variable: A variable from the inner scope.\n        \n        Returns:\n            A string demonstrating variable closure.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"Outer variable: {outer_variable}, Inner variable: {inner_variable}\"\n    \n    return inner_function\n\ndef main():\n    # Create an outer function with a variable\n    outer_var = \"Hello\"\n    inner_func = outer_function(outer_var)\n    \n    # Call the inner function with its own variable\n    inner_var = \"World\"\n    result = inner_func(inner_var)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  We define an `outer_function` that takes an `outer_variable` as an argument.\n2.  Inside the `outer_function`, we define an `inner_function` that takes an `inner_variable` as an argument.\n3.  The `inner_function` has access to both its own local variables (`inner_variable`) and the variables of its outer scope (`outer_variable`).\n4.  We return the `inner_function` from the `outer_function`, creating a closure.\n5.  In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `outer_function` with a variable and call the returned `inner_function` with its own variable.\n6.  The output demonstrates that the `inner_function` has access to both the `outer_variable` and its own local variables.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOuter variable: Hello, Inner variable: World\n```\n\nThis program showcases the concept of variable closure, where a function has access to its own local variables and the variables of its outer scope.",
