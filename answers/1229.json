  "prompt": "Write a program that uses nested for loops to print a matrix based on a given number of rows and columns.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Output:\n# 1 2 3\n# 4 5 6\n# 7 8 9\n\n# Explanation:\n# This code uses nested for loops to print a matrix based on the given number of rows and columns.\n# The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.\n# The value of the cell is calculated as (row * numColumns) + column + 1, where row and column are 0-based indices.\n# This ensures that the values are printed in a continuous sequence from 1 to numRows * numColumns.\n\nnumRows = 3\nnumColumns = 3\n\nfor row in range(numRows):\n    for column in range(numColumns):\n        print((row * numColumns) + column + 1, end=' ')\n    print()\n```\nNote that I've added a comment at the top to explain the expected output, and a comment section at the bottom to provide a brief explanation of how the code works. The rest of the code is identical to the specification.",
