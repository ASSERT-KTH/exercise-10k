  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and outputs the distance between them.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D or 3D space:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (list): Coordinates of the first point.\n        point2 (list): Coordinates of the second point.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(point1) != len(point2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both points must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    squared_distances = [(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]\n    return math.sqrt(sum(squared_distances))\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the coordinates of the two points from the user\n    num_dimensions = int(input(\"Enter the number of dimensions (2 or 3): \"))\n    point1 = [float(input(f\"Enter x{'' if num_dimensions == 2 else f'{i+1}'} coordinate of point 1: \")) for i in range(num_dimensions)]\n    point2 = [float(input(f\"Enter x{'' if num_dimensions == 2 else f'{i+1}'} coordinate of point 2: \")) for i in range(num_dimensions)]\n\n    # Calculate and print the distance\n    distance_between_points = distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance_between_points}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n* The program defines a function `distance` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.\n* The `distance` function takes two lists of coordinates as input, checks if they have the same number of dimensions, and returns the distance between them.\n* The `main` function prompts the user to input the coordinates of two points and then calls the `distance` function to calculate and print the distance between them.\n* The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points and then takes the square root of the sum of these squared differences to get the distance.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* To calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space, run the program and enter `2` when prompted for the number of dimensions. Then, enter the x and y coordinates of the two points.\n* To calculate the distance between two points in a 3D space, run the program and enter `3` when prompted for the number of dimensions. Then, enter the x, y, and z coordinates of the two points.",
