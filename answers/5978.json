  "answer": "**Common Elements Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are common to both input lists.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing the elements that are common to both input lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first input list.\n        list2 (list): The second input list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing the common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    common = common_elements(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Common elements:\", common)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `common_elements` function takes two lists as input: `list1` and `list2`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the elements that are common to both input lists.\n3. The `if element in list2` condition filters out elements that are not present in `list2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `common_elements` function with example lists.\n5. The program prints the common elements to the console.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nCommon elements: [4, 5]\n```\n\nNote: This program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the `in` operator used in the list comprehension. For large input lists, a more efficient approach using sets or dictionaries may be necessary.",
