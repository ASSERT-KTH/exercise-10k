  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes a list and a target element as input and returns the index of the target element in the list.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(lst, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of a target element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n        target: The target element to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return lst.index(target)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    target = 3\n    index = find_index(lst, target)\n\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"Target element {target} found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target element {target} not found in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. The `find_index` function takes a list `lst` and a target element `target` as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `index` method of the list to find the index of the target element.\n3. If the target element is found, its index is returned. If not, a `ValueError` exception is raised.\n4. The `try-except` block catches this exception and returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the list.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of `find_index` with an example list and target element.\n6. The result is printed to the console, indicating whether the target element was found and at what index.\n\n### Notes\n- This program assumes that the list does not contain duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, this program will return the index of the first occurrence.\n- The `index` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, making this program suitable for lists of moderate size. For very large lists, a more efficient data structure like a dictionary or a set might be necessary.",
