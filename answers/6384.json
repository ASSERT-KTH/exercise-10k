  "prompt": "Develop a program that takes in the current hour and prints out a greeting message. If the hour is between 6 and 11, the message should be 'Good morning!', if it's between 12 and 16, the message should be 'Good afternoon!', if it's between 17 and 20, the message should be 'Good evening!', otherwise the message should be 'Good night!'",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(hour):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a greeting message based on the current hour.\n\n    Args:\n        hour (int): The current hour.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the hour is between 6 and 11\n    if 6 <= hour <= 11:\n        print(\"Good morning!\")\n    # Check if the hour is between 12 and 16\n    elif 12 <= hour <= 16:\n        print(\"Good afternoon!\")\n    # Check if the hour is between 17 and 20\n    elif 17 <= hour <= 20:\n        print(\"Good evening!\")\n    # If the hour is not in any of the above ranges, print 'Good night!'\n    else:\n        print(\"Good night!\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current hour from the user\n    hour = int(input(\"Enter the current hour (in 24-hour format): \"))\n\n    # Print the greeting message\n    print_greeting(hour)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `print_greeting` function takes an `hour` as input and prints a greeting message based on the hour.\n* The function uses if-elif-else statements to check the hour and print the corresponding message.\n* The `main` function gets the current hour from the user, calls the `print_greeting` function, and prints the greeting message.\n* The program uses a 24-hour clock, so the user should enter the hour in 24-hour format (e.g., 14 for 2 PM).\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `8`, the program will print `Good morning!`.\n* If the user enters `14`, the program will print `Good afternoon!`.\n* If the user enters `18`, the program will print `Good evening!`.\n* If the user enters `22`, the program will print `Good night!`.",
