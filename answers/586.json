  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among all the strings.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for string in strs:\n            if string[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Test the function\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"a\"]))  # Output: \"a\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"apple\"]))  # Output: \"apple\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([]))  # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty string.\n\nThen, it finds the shortest string in the list. The reason for this is that the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n\nNext, it iterates over each character in the shortest string. For each character, it checks if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings. If it finds a character that does not match, it returns the prefix up to the previous character.\n\nIf it gets through all characters in the shortest string without finding a mismatch, it means that the shortest string is a prefix of all other strings, so it returns the shortest string.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the length of the input list and m is the length of the shortest string. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the shortest string and the prefix.",
