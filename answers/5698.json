  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a credit card number as input and checks if it's valid using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks the validity of a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm and conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card(card_number):\n    # Convert card number to a list of integers\n    card_number = [int(x) for x in str(card_number)]\n    \n    # Reverse the card number\n    card_number = card_number[::-1]\n    \n    # Double every second digit\n    for i in range(1, len(card_number), 2):\n        card_number[i] *= 2\n        # Subtract 9 from numbers over 9\n        if card_number[i] > 9:\n            card_number[i] -= 9\n    \n    # If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, the card number is valid\n    if sum(card_number) % 10 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    card_number = input(\"Enter your credit card number: \")\n    \n    # Check if the input is a valid integer\n    if card_number.isdigit():\n        # Check if the card number is valid\n        if validate_credit_card(card_number):\n            print(\"The credit card number is valid.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The credit card number is not valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid credit card number.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program first checks if the input is a valid integer. If it is, it checks the validity of the credit card number using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm works by doubling every second digit of the card number (starting from the right), subtracting 9 from any numbers over 9, and then checking if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10. If the sum is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.",
