  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that calculates the average of the elements in a given list.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of the elements in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the elements in the list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the input list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not input_list:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    try:\n        average = sum(input_list) / len(input_list)\n        return average\n    except TypeError:\n        raise TypeError(\"Input list contains non-numeric values\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    try:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"The average of the list is: {average}\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list as input and returns the average of its elements.\n2. It first checks if the input list is empty. If so, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It then attempts to calculate the average by summing all elements and dividing by the list length.\n4. If the list contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` is raised.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_average` with a sample list of numbers.\n6. It handles potential errors and prints the result or an error message accordingly.\n\n**Running the Program:**\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python average_calculator.py`). The program will output the average of the example list. You can modify the `numbers` list in the `main` function to test with different inputs.",
