  "answer": "**Bank Account Manager Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program allows users to manage a bank account by performing basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and checking the balance.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposit successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize account with $1000\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Manager\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program uses a `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance and perform operations. The `main` function provides a simple menu-driven interface for users to interact with the account.\n\n1.  The `BankAccount` class has an `__init__` method to initialize the account with an optional initial balance.\n2.  The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the balance if it's positive.\n3.  The `withdraw` method subtracts the specified amount from the balance if it's positive and doesn't exceed the current balance.\n4.  The `check_balance` method displays the current balance.\n5.  In the `main` function, a `while` loop continuously prompts the user for input until they choose to exit.\n6.  Based on the user's choice, the corresponding method is called to perform the desired operation.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Deposit $500: Choose option 1 and enter `500` when prompted.\n*   Withdraw $200: Choose option 2 and enter `200` when prompted.\n*   Check balance: Choose option 3 to display the current balance.\n*   Exit program: Choose option 4 to exit the program.",
