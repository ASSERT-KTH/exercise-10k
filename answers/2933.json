  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=========================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using a while loop in Python. The game will continue to ask the user for input until the user decides to quit.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    play_again = \"yes\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The computer will generate its own random choice and display both choices.\n4. The program will determine the winner and display the result.\n5. Choose to play again by entering \"yes\" when prompted.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you decide to quit by entering \"no\".",
