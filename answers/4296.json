  "answer": "**Dictionary Filter Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function filters a dictionary based on a given condition. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with only the key-value pairs that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_dict(input_dict, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a dictionary based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n    input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be filtered.\n    condition (function): A function that takes a key-value pair and returns True if the pair should be included in the filtered dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary with only the key-value pairs that meet the specified condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: value for key, value in input_dict.items() if condition(key, value)}\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n\n# Define a condition function that checks if the value is even\ndef is_even(key, value):\n    return value % 2 == 0\n\n# Filter the dictionary using the condition function\nfiltered_numbers = filter_dict(numbers, is_even)\nprint(filtered_numbers)  # Output: {'b': 2, 'd': 4}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `filter_dict` function takes two arguments: `input_dict` (the dictionary to be filtered) and `condition` (a function that defines the filtering condition).\n2. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with only the key-value pairs that meet the specified condition.\n3. The `condition` function is called for each key-value pair in the input dictionary, and if it returns `True`, the pair is included in the filtered dictionary.\n4. The filtered dictionary is returned as the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than a certain threshold.\n* Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the key matches a certain pattern.\n* Filter a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is of a certain data type.",
