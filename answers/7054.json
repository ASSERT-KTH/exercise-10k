Run the program.\n2. Enter a password when prompted.\n3. The program will print out whether the password is valid or not.\n\nNote: This program uses regular expressions to check for specific character types in the password. The `re.search` function returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string, or None otherwise. The `[^A-Za-z0-9]` pattern matches any character that is not a letter or a digit, which is used to check for special characters.",
