  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two arguments, one with a default value, and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum, with one of the arguments having a default value. This will help you understand how to define and use such functions in your code. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function named 'sum_two_numbers' that takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b'.\n# The argument 'b' has a default value of 0, which means it's optional when calling the function.\ndef sum_two_numbers(a, b=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number to be added.\n        b (int, optional): The second number to be added. Defaults to 0.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of 'a' and 'b'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if both 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n    # If not, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message.\n    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both arguments must be integers.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of 'a' and 'b' using the '+' operator.\n    # The result will be stored in the 'total' variable.\n    total = a + b\n    \n    # Return the calculated sum.\n    return total\n\n# Test the function with some examples.\nprint(sum_two_numbers(5, 10))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_two_numbers(7))     # Output: 7\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sum_two_numbers` is defined with two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `b` has a default value of `0`. This allows the function to be called with either one or two arguments.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed to ensure both `a` and `b` are integers using the `isinstance` function. If not, a `TypeError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n* The sum of `a` and `b` is calculated using the `+` operator and stored in the `total` variable, which is then returned by the function.\n* Example use cases are provided to demonstrate the function's usage, including calling it with two arguments and with a single argument, relying on the default value for the second argument.",
