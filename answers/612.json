  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial investment amount\n        rate (float): Annual interest rate (in decimal)\n        time (int): Time period (in years)\n        frequency (int): Compounding frequency (1 = annually, 2 = semi-annually, 4 = quarterly, 12 = monthly)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total amount after compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    total_amount = principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)\n    return total_amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Compound Interest Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (1 = annually, 2 = semi-annually, 4 = quarterly, 12 = monthly): \"))\n\n    total_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)\n    interest_earned = total_amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Earned: ${interest_earned:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Calculate the compound interest on a $10,000 investment with an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually for 5 years.\n\t* Input: `principal = 10000`, `rate = 5`, `time = 5`, `frequency = 1`\n\t* Output: `Total Amount: $12,763.79`, `Interest Earned: $2,763.79`\n2. Calculate the compound interest on a $5,000 investment with an annual interest rate of 3% compounded quarterly for 10 years.\n\t* Input: `principal = 5000`, `rate = 3`, `time = 10`, `frequency = 4`\n\t* Output: `Total Amount: $7,539.12`, `Interest Earned: $2,539.12`\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to enter the interest rate as a decimal value (e.g., 5% = 0.05).\n* Choose the correct compounding frequency based on the investment details.\n* Use this program as a starting point and modify it to suit your specific needs, such as adding more features or handling different types of investments.",
