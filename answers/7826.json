  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers and a number of positions to rotate the array to the right. The program should rotate the array in-place, meaning it should not create a new array, but modify the existing one.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def rotate(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Rotates the input list to the right by a specified number of positions.\n        \n        The rotation is done in-place, meaning the input list is modified directly\n        without creating a new list.\n        \n        Args:\n            nums (list[int]): The input list to be rotated.\n            k (int): The number of positions to rotate the list to the right.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(nums)\n        k %= n  # Ensure k is within the range of the list length\n        \n        def reverse(left, right):\n            \"\"\"\n            Reverses the sublist from index left to right (inclusive).\n            \"\"\"\n            while left < right:\n                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n        \n        reverse(0, n - 1)  # Reverse the entire list\n        reverse(0, k - 1)  # Reverse the first k elements\n        reverse(k, n - 1)  # Reverse the rest of the list\n```\nThis code defines a `Solution` class with a `rotate` method that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as input. The method modifies the list in-place by rotating it to the right by `k` positions.\n\nThe `reverse` function is used to reverse sublists of the input list. It takes two indices `left` and `right` as input and reverses the sublist from `left` to `right` (inclusive).\n\nThe main logic of the `rotate` method is as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the effective rotation `k` by taking the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the list `n`. This ensures that `k` is within the range of the list length.\n2. Reverse the entire list using the `reverse` function.\n3. Reverse the first `k` elements of the list using the `reverse` function.\n4. Reverse the rest of the list (from index `k` to the end) using the `reverse` function.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is rotated to the right by `k` positions in-place, without creating a new list.",
