  "answer": "**Quiz Game Program**\n======================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program uses a while loop to play a quiz game with the user. The program asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store the questions, answers, and options\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef play_quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the current question\n    question_number = 1\n    \n    # Loop through each question\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion {question_number}: {question}\")\n        \n        # Print the options\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        \n        # Get the user's answer\n        user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        \n        # Check if the user's answer is correct\n        if user_answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {options['answer']}.\")\n        \n        # Increment the question number\n        question_number += 1\n    \n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"\\nGame over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_quiz()\n        play_again = input(\"Would you like to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question to the best of your ability.\n3. After answering all questions, your final score will be displayed.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter \"y\" to play again or \"n\" to quit.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a dictionary to store the questions, answers, and options. The `play_quiz` function loops through each question, prints the options, gets the user's answer, checks if the answer is correct, and keeps track of the score. The `main` function uses a while loop to allow the user to play again if they choose to.",
