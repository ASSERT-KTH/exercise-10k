  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula to calculate the volume of a cube is:\n\nV = s\u00b3\n\nwhere V is the volume and s is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of the cube's side.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cube is: {volume} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_volume` function takes the side length as an argument and returns the calculated volume.\n2. It checks if the side length is a positive number and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n3. The volume is calculated using the formula V = s\u00b3, which is implemented using the exponentiation operator (`**`).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_volume` function by asking the user for the side length and printing the calculated volume.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save the code in a file (e.g., `cube_volume.py`).\n2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python cube_volume.py`).\n3. Enter the side length of the cube when prompted.\n4. The program will print the calculated volume.",
