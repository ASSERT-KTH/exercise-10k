Run the script.\n2. Enter the current price when prompted.\n3. Enter the previous price when prompted.\n4. The script will calculate and print the inflation rate.\n\n### Notes\n* This script uses a simple formula to calculate the inflation rate: `((current_price - previous_price) / previous_price) * 100`.\n* The previous price cannot be zero, as this would result in a division by zero error. If the user enters a previous price of zero, the script will raise a `ValueError`.",
