  "answer": "**Tip Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a tip based on the total bill using if/else statements. The tip percentage is determined by the quality of service, which is input by the user.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(bill, service):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a tip based on the total bill and service quality.\n\n    Args:\n        bill (float): The total bill amount.\n        service (str): The quality of service (poor, good, excellent).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if service == \"poor\":\n        tip_percentage = 0.05\n    elif service == \"good\":\n        tip_percentage = 0.10\n    elif service == \"excellent\":\n        tip_percentage = 0.15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid service quality. Defaulting to 10% tip.\")\n        tip_percentage = 0.10\n\n    tip_amount = bill * tip_percentage\n    return tip_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill amount: $\"))\n    service = input(\"Enter the quality of service (poor, good, excellent): \")\n\n    # Calculate the tip\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(bill, service)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Bill: ${bill:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip ({service} service): ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total: ${bill + tip_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the total bill amount: `$100`\n2. Enter the quality of service: `excellent`\n3. The program calculates the tip based on the service quality and prints the result:\n```\nBill: $100.00\nTip (excellent service): $15.00\nTotal: $115.00\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple if/else statement to determine the tip percentage based on the service quality.\n* The `calculate_tip` function takes in the bill amount and service quality as arguments and returns the calculated tip amount.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_tip` function, and prints the result.\n* The program uses f-strings to format the output with two decimal places.",
