  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates and prints the first n numbers in an arithmetic and geometric sequence using for loops.\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate and print the first n numbers in an arithmetic sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        d (int): The common difference of the sequence.\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Arithmetic Sequence:\")\n    for i in range(n):\n        term = a + (i * d)\n        print(term, end=\" \")\n\n\ndef geometric_sequence(a, r, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate and print the first n numbers in a geometric sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        r (int): The common ratio of the sequence.\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Geometric Sequence:\")\n    for i in range(n):\n        term = a * (r ** i)\n        print(term, end=\" \")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    a = 2  # First term\n    d = 3  # Common difference\n    r = 2  # Common ratio\n    n = 10  # Number of terms\n\n    arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    geometric_sequence(a, r, n)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `arithmetic_sequence` function generates and prints the first n numbers in an arithmetic sequence.\n* The `geometric_sequence` function generates and prints the first n numbers in a geometric sequence.\n* The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the above functions.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block ensures the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nArithmetic Sequence:\n2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 \nGeometric Sequence:\n2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 \n```",
