  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input, reverses the order of its elements, and then sorts the array in ascending order. The program should output the modified array.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n\n    while (t--) {\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n\n        int a[n];\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cin >> a[i];\n        }\n\n        reverse(a, a + n);\n\n        sort(a, a + n);\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cout << a[i] << \" \";\n        }\n        cout << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header file to include all standard C++ libraries, and uses the `namespace std;` directive to avoid prefixing standard library functions with `std::`.\n\nThe code then uses the `main` function to read the number of test cases `t` and loop through each test case using a `while` loop. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, declares an array `a` of size `n`, and reads the elements of the array from the input.\n\nThe code then reverses the order of the elements in the array using the `reverse` function, and sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort` function.\n\nFinally, the code prints the modified array to the output using a `for` loop, with each element separated by a space and a newline character at the end of each test case.\n\nNote that this code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not recommended in production code due to its large size and potential for naming conflicts. However, it is commonly used in competitive programming and coding challenges to simplify the code and reduce the number of lines.",
