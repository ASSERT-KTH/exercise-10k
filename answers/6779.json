  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to n:\n\n```python\ndef print_squares(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the squares of numbers from 1 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(f\"{i}^2 = {i ** 2}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the value of n from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            n = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if n <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Print the squares of numbers from 1 to n\n    print_squares(n)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the program works:**\n\n1. The `print_squares` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n2. Inside the loop, it calculates the square of the current number `i` using the exponentiation operator `**` and prints the result.\n3. The `main` function gets the value of `n` from the user using a `while` loop to ensure that the input is a positive integer.\n4. Once the value of `n` is validated, the `main` function calls the `print_squares` function to print the squares of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\nEnter a positive integer: 5\n1^2 = 1\n2^2 = 4\n3^2 = 9\n4^2 = 16\n5^2 = 25\n```",
