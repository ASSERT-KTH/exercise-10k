  "answer": "**Printing Numbers from 1 to 10**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a simple Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, 11.\n* The `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`.\n* The `print(i)` statement prints the current number to the console.\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `print_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python print_numbers.py`) to see the output.",
