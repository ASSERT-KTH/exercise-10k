  "prompt": "Create a program that reads a user's first and last name and prints out a greeting message.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_name():\n    \"\"\"Gets the user's first and last name.\"\"\"\n    first_name = input(\"Please enter your first name: \")\n    last_name = input(\"Please enter your last name: \")\n    return first_name, last_name\n\ndef print_greeting(first_name, last_name):\n    \"\"\"Prints a greeting message with the user's name.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}! It's nice to meet you.\")\n\ndef main():\n    first_name, last_name = get_user_name()\n    print_greeting(first_name, last_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `get_user_name` function uses the built-in `input` function to get the user's first and last name.\n* The `print_greeting` function uses an f-string to format the greeting message with the user's name.\n* The `main` function calls `get_user_name` to get the user's name, and then calls `print_greeting` to print the greeting message.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your first and last name. After you enter your name, it will print out a greeting message. Here's an example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your first name: John\nPlease enter your last name: Doe\nHello, John Doe! It's nice to meet you.\n```",
