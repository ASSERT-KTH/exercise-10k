  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator Program**\n======================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n*   The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. It iteratively replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero.\n*   At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Usage\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `gcd_calculator.py`).\n2.  Run the program using Python (e.g., `python gcd_calculator.py`).\n3.  The program will calculate and print the GCD of the example numbers (48 and 18).\n4.  You can modify the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the GCD of different numbers.",
