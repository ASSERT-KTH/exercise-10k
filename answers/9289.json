  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop or a while loop. The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer n.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n```\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user to enter a positive integer n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            n = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n            if n <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum of even numbers\n    sum_even = sum_even_numbers(n)\n    print(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to {n} is: {sum_even}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a positive integer `n` and validates the input using a `try`-`except` block.\n3. Once the input is validated, the `main` function calls the `sum_even_numbers` function with the user-input `n` and prints the result.\n\nYou can also use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to calculate the sum of even numbers. Here's an example:\n```\ndef sum_even_numbers(n):\n    total = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += i\n        i += 1\n    return total\n```\nThis implementation uses a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and calculates the sum of even numbers in the same way as the `for` loop implementation.",
