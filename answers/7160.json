  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, you must be at least 18 years old to vote.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility(age):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n\n    Args:\n        age (int): The age of the person.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the person is eligible to vote, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return age >= 18\n\ndef main():\n    # Ask for the person's age\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    # Check if the person is eligible to vote\n    if check_voting_eligibility(age):\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `check_voting_eligibility` function takes the person's age as input and returns `True` if they are eligible to vote (i.e., their age is 18 or older) and `False` otherwise.\n* The `main` function asks the user for their age, checks if the input is a valid integer, and then calls `check_voting_eligibility` to determine if the person is eligible to vote.\n* The program prints out a message indicating whether the person is eligible to vote or not.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters an age of 25, the program will print \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n* If the user enters an age of 17, the program will print \"You are not eligible to vote. You must be at least 18 years old.\"\n* If the user enters a non-integer value (e.g., \"abc\"), the program will print \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\" and ask for the age again.",
