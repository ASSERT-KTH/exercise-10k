  "answer": "**Merging Two Sorted Arrays**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution using a two-pointer technique:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first sorted array.\n        arr2 (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            result.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in arr1, append them to the result\n    while i < len(arr1):\n        result.append(arr1[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in arr2, append them to the result\n    while j < len(arr2):\n        result.append(arr2[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\narr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\narr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\nprint(merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.\n2. Compare the elements at the current positions of `arr1` and `arr2`. If the element in `arr1` is smaller, append it to the result and increment `i`. Otherwise, append the element from `arr2` to the result and increment `j`.\n3. Repeat step 2 until one of the arrays is exhausted.\n4. Append any remaining elements from the non-exhausted array to the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively. This is because we are scanning both arrays once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n + m), as we are creating a new array to store the merged result.",
