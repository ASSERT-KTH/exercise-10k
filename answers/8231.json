  "answer": "**Employee Salary Calculator**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates an employee's salary based on their job title and years of experience.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_salary(job_title, years_of_experience, base_salary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates an employee's salary based on their job title and years of experience.\n\n    Args:\n        job_title (str): The employee's job title.\n        years_of_experience (int): The employee's years of experience.\n        base_salary (float): The base salary for the employee's job title.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The employee's calculated salary.\n    \"\"\"\n    if job_title == \"Manager\":\n        if years_of_experience < 5:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.1\n        elif years_of_experience < 10:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.2\n        else:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.3\n    elif job_title == \"Developer\":\n        if years_of_experience < 3:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.05\n        elif years_of_experience < 6:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.1\n        else:\n            salary = base_salary * 1.2\n    elif job_title == \"Intern\":\n        if years_of_experience < 1:\n            salary = base_salary * 0.8\n        else:\n            salary = base_salary * 0.9\n    else:\n        salary = base_salary\n\n    return salary\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    job_title = \"Manager\"\n    years_of_experience = 8\n    base_salary = 50000.0\n\n    salary = calculate_salary(job_title, years_of_experience, base_salary)\n    print(f\"The salary for a {job_title} with {years_of_experience} years of experience is: ${salary:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_salary` that takes in three parameters:\n\n*   `job_title`: The employee's job title.\n*   `years_of_experience`: The employee's years of experience.\n*   `base_salary`: The base salary for the employee's job title.\n\nThe function uses if/else statements to determine the employee's salary based on their job title and years of experience. The salary is calculated by multiplying the base salary by a factor that depends on the job title and years of experience.\n\nIn the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_salary` function, where we calculate the salary for a Manager with 8 years of experience and a base salary of $50,000.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Calculate the salary for a Developer with 5 years of experience and a base salary of $60,000.\n*   Calculate the salary for an Intern with 1 year of experience and a base salary of $30,000.\n*   Calculate the salary for a Manager with 12 years of experience and a base salary of $80,000.",
