  "answer": "**Function: Filter Numbers Above Threshold**\n==============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function filters a list of numbers based on a given threshold. It returns a new list containing only the numbers that are above the threshold.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of numbers based on a given threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n        threshold (float): The threshold value.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the numbers above the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if num > threshold]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    threshold = 3\n    result = filter_above_threshold(numbers, threshold)\n    print(result)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `filter_above_threshold` takes two parameters: `numbers` (a list of numbers) and `threshold` (a float value).\n2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `numbers` list and includes only the numbers that are greater than the `threshold` in the new list.\n3. The function returns the new list.\n4. In the example usage, we create a list of numbers and set a threshold value. We then call the `filter_above_threshold` function with these values and print the result.",
