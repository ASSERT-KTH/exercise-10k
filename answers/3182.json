  "answer": "Here is a Python program that takes a student's score as input and uses if/else statements to determine their grade:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = int(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            if score < 0 or score > 100:\n                print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes the student's score as input and uses if/else statements to determine their grade.\n*   The `main` function gets the student's score from the user, checks that it is a valid number between 0 and 100, and then calls `calculate_grade` to calculate the grade.\n*   The grade is then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the student's score is 95, the program will output: `The student's grade is: A`\n*   If the student's score is 75, the program will output: `The student's grade is: C`\n*   If the student's score is 40, the program will output: `The student's grade is: F`\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This program assumes that the grade boundaries are as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (Below 60).\n*   The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid score.",
