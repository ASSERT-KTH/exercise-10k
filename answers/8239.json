  "answer": "**Flight Status Checker**\n================================\n\nThis program uses if/else statements to check the flight status based on the flight number and the current status of the flight.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef check_flight_status(flight_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the flight status based on the flight number.\n\n    Args:\n        flight_number (str): The flight number.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The flight status.\n    \"\"\"\n    flight_status = {\n        \"AA101\": \"On Time\",\n        \"AA102\": \"Delayed\",\n        \"AA103\": \"Cancelled\",\n        \"UA201\": \"On Time\",\n        \"UA202\": \"Delayed\",\n        \"UA203\": \"Cancelled\"\n    }\n\n    if flight_number in flight_status:\n        if flight_status[flight_number] == \"On Time\":\n            return f\"Flight {flight_number} is on time.\"\n        elif flight_status[flight_number] == \"Delayed\":\n            return f\"Flight {flight_number} is delayed. Please check with the airline for the latest updates.\"\n        else:\n            return f\"Flight {flight_number} is cancelled. Please contact the airline to rebook or refund your ticket.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Flight {flight_number} not found. Please check the flight number and try again.\"\n\ndef main():\n    flight_number = input(\"Enter the flight number: \")\n    print(check_flight_status(flight_number))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `check_flight_status` function takes the flight number as an argument and checks if it exists in the `flight_status` dictionary.\n2. If the flight number exists, it checks the status of the flight and returns a message based on the status.\n3. If the flight number does not exist, it returns a message indicating that the flight was not found.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the flight number and calls the `check_flight_status` function with the entered flight number.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a valid flight number with an \"On Time\" status: `AA101`\n* Enter a valid flight number with a \"Delayed\" status: `AA102`\n* Enter a valid flight number with a \"Cancelled\" status: `AA103`\n* Enter an invalid flight number: `InvalidFlight`\n\nNote: This program uses a hardcoded dictionary to store the flight status. In a real-world application, you would likely retrieve the flight status from an API or a database.",
