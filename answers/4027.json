  "answer": "**Quick Sort Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nQuick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the quick sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If the array has 1 or 0 elements, it is already sorted.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Select the pivot element (in this case, the middle element).\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n\n    # Divide the array into three sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot,\n    # elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot.\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n\n    # Recursively sort the sub-arrays and combine the results.\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Base case**: If the array has 1 or 0 elements, it is already sorted, so we return the array as is.\n2.  **Pivot selection**: We select a pivot element from the array. In this implementation, we choose the middle element, but other pivot selection methods like the first or last element can also be used.\n3.  **Partitioning**: We divide the array into three sub-arrays:\n\n    *   `left`: elements less than the pivot\n    *   `middle`: elements equal to the pivot\n    *   `right`: elements greater than the pivot\n4.  **Recursive sorting**: We recursively sort the `left` and `right` sub-arrays and combine the results with the `middle` sub-array to produce the final sorted array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of quick sort is O(n log n) on average, but it can be O(n^2) in the worst case if the pivot is chosen poorly. However, with a good pivot selection method, quick sort is generally one of the fastest and most efficient sorting algorithms.",
