  "answer": "**Bank Account Management Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program allows users to manage a bank account by performing basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance. It uses if/else statements to handle different scenarios and user inputs.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_name, balance=0):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_name = account_name\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposit successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            if amount <= self.balance:\n                self.balance -= amount\n                print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Insufficient funds for withdrawal.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account_number = input(\"Enter your account number: \")\n    account_name = input(\"Enter your account name: \")\n    account = BankAccount(account_number, account_name)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program defines a `BankAccount` class with attributes for account number, account name, and balance.\n2. The class has methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.\n3. The `deposit` method checks if the deposit amount is positive and updates the balance accordingly.\n4. The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount is positive and if there are sufficient funds in the account.\n5. The `check_balance` method displays the current balance.\n6. The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` object and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with their account.\n7. The program uses if/else statements to handle different user inputs and scenarios.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter your account number and name.\n2. Choose option 1 to deposit $100.\n3. Choose option 2 to withdraw $50.\n4. Choose option 3 to check your balance.\n5. Choose option 4 to exit the program.",
