  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if statements",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero:\n\n```python\ndef check_number(num):\n    if num > 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is a positive number.\")\n    elif num < 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is a negative number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is zero.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncheck_number(num)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define a function `check_number` that takes one argument `num`.\n2. Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if the number is greater than 0. If it is, we print a message indicating that the number is positive.\n3. If the number is not greater than 0, we use an `elif` statement to check if the number is less than 0. If it is, we print a message indicating that the number is negative.\n4. If the number is neither greater than 0 nor less than 0, we know it must be 0. In this case, we print a message indicating that the number is zero.\n5. Finally, we ask the user to input a number, convert it to a float (to allow for decimal numbers), and call the `check_number` function with the input number.\n\nYou can save this code to a file with a `.py` extension and run it from the command line to test it.",
