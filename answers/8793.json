  "answer": "**Calculating the Volume of a Sphere**\n=====================================\n\nHere is a Python program that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sphere_volume(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n    try:\n        volume = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)\n        print(f\"The volume of the sphere is: {volume:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The program defines a function `calculate_sphere_volume` that takes the radius of the sphere as input and returns its volume.\n* The formula for the volume of a sphere is `(4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3`, where `r` is the radius.\n* The `main` function prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere, calculates its volume using the `calculate_sphere_volume` function, and prints the result.\n* The program also includes error handling to ensure that the radius is not negative.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a radius of `5`.\n* The program will output the volume of the sphere, which is approximately `523.60`.",
