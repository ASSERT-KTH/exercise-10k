  "prompt": "Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs where each key is a letter from A to E and each value is a number from 1 to 5",
  "answer": "Here is a Python dictionary that meets the requirements:\n```python\nmy_dict = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 4, 'E': 5}\n```\nThis dictionary has 5 key-value pairs, where each key is a letter from A to E and each value is a corresponding number from 1 to 5. Let me know if you have any further requests! \n\nIf you want to create this dictionary programmatically, you can use the following code:\n```python\nmy_dict = {chr(65+i): i+1 for i in range(5)}\n```\nThis code uses a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary, where `chr(65+i)` generates the letters A to E (65 is the ASCII code for 'A') and `i+1` generates the numbers 1 to 5.",
