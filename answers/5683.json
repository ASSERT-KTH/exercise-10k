  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the temperature as input and checks if it's hot, cold, or mild using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks the temperature:\n\n```python\ndef check_temperature(temp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the temperature and returns if it's hot, cold, or mild.\n\n    Args:\n        temp (float): The temperature in Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string indicating if the temperature is hot, cold, or mild.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temp < 10:\n        return \"Cold\"\n    elif 10 <= temp <= 25:\n        return \"Mild\"\n    else:\n        return \"Hot\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the temperature from the user\n    temp = float(input(\"Enter the temperature in Celsius: \"))\n\n    # Check the temperature\n    result = check_temperature(temp)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The temperature is {result}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1.  **User Input**: The program asks the user to input the temperature in Celsius.\n2.  **Temperature Check**: The `check_temperature` function checks the temperature and returns a string indicating if it's hot, cold, or mild.\n3.  **Result**: The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user inputs `5`, the program will output: `The temperature is Cold.`\n*   If the user inputs `15`, the program will output: `The temperature is Mild.`\n*   If the user inputs `30`, the program will output: `The temperature is Hot.`\n\nNote that the temperature ranges for hot, cold, and mild are arbitrary and can be adjusted according to your needs. In this example, temperatures below 10\u00b0C are considered cold, temperatures between 10\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C are considered mild, and temperatures above 25\u00b0C are considered hot.",
