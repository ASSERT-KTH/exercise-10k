  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should take in the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal) and the amount. If the transaction type is 'deposit', the program should add the amount to the account balance. If the transaction type is 'withdrawal', the program should subtract the amount from the account balance, but only if the account balance is sufficient. If the account balance is not sufficient, the program should print an error message. The initial account balance is $1000.",
  "answer": "**Bank Transaction System Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program simulates a bank transaction system. It takes in the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal) and the amount, and updates the account balance accordingly.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance.\n        \n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float): The initial account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits a specified amount into the account.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws a specified amount from the account, if sufficient balance exists.\n        \n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Error: Insufficient balance.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize a BankAccount object with an initial balance of $1000\n    account = BankAccount(1000)\n    print(f\"Initial balance: ${account.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Get the transaction type from the user\n        transaction_type = input(\"Enter transaction type (deposit/withdrawal) or 'quit' to exit: \")\n\n        if transaction_type.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n\n        # Get the transaction amount from the user\n        try:\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter transaction amount: $\"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid amount. Please enter a valid number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Perform the transaction\n        if transaction_type.lower() == 'deposit':\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif transaction_type.lower() == 'withdrawal':\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid transaction type. Please enter 'deposit' or 'withdrawal'.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will display the initial account balance of $1000.\n3. Enter the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal) when prompted.\n4. Enter the transaction amount when prompted.\n5. The program will perform the transaction and display the new account balance.\n6. To exit the program, enter 'quit' when prompted for the transaction type.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance and perform transactions. The `main` function provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the program.",
