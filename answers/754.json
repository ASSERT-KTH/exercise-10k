  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Tournament Program**\n=============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a Rock Paper Scissors tournament between the user and the computer. The tournament consists of a series of matches, and the player with the most wins at the end of the tournament is declared the winner.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of a single match\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef play_tournament(num_matches):\n    \"\"\"Play a tournament of Rock Paper Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_wins = 0\n    computer_wins = 0\n    ties = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_matches):\n        print(f\"\\nMatch {i+1}:\")\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nComputer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            ties += 1\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(\"You win this match!\")\n            user_wins += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins this match!\")\n            computer_wins += 1\n\n    print(f\"\\nTournament Results:\")\n    print(f\"User wins: {user_wins}\")\n    print(f\"Computer wins: {computer_wins}\")\n    print(f\"Ties: {ties}\")\n\n    if user_wins > computer_wins:\n        print(\"You win the tournament! Congratulations!\")\n    elif computer_wins > user_wins:\n        print(\"Computer wins the tournament! Better luck next time!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's a tie tournament! Well played!\")\n\ndef main():\n    num_matches = int(input(\"Enter the number of matches in the tournament: \"))\n    play_tournament(num_matches)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program and enter the number of matches you want to play in the tournament.\n2. For each match, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the winner of the match will be determined.\n4. The tournament results will be displayed at the end, including the number of wins, losses, and ties for both the user and the computer.\n5. The overall winner of the tournament will be declared based on the number of wins.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple random number generator to simulate the computer's choices. In a real-world implementation, you may want to use a more secure random number generator to prevent predictability.",
