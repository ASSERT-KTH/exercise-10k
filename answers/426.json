  "answer": "**User Information Input and Output**\n\nBelow is an example of how you can achieve this using Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's name and age.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.\")\n\n    return name, age\n\ndef print_user_info(name, age):\n    \"\"\"Print out a message including the user's information.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\ndef main():\n    name, age = get_user_info()\n    print_user_info(name, age)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works:**\n\n1. The `get_user_info` function prompts the user to enter their name and age.\n2. The age input is validated to ensure it's a valid integer.\n3. The `print_user_info` function takes the user's name and age as input and prints out a greeting message.\n4. The `main` function calls `get_user_info` to get the user's information and then calls `print_user_info` to print out the message.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run this code, it will prompt you to enter your name and age. After entering the information, it will print out a greeting message including your name and age. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John\nPlease enter your age: 30\nHello, John! You are 30 years old.\n```",
