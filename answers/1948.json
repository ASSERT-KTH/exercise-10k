  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and a value as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list. If the value is not found, return -1.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_index(l, val):\n    try:\n        return l.index(val)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Test cases\nprint(find_index([1, 2, 3], 2))  # Expected output: 1\nprint(find_index([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Expected output: -1\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications and implemented the code as described. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
