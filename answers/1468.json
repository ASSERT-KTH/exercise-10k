  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user, calculates the modulus (remainder), and prints the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\n# Get two integer inputs from the user\nn1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nn2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate the modulus (remainder)\ns = n1 % n2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The modulus of\", n1, \"and\", n2, \"is:\", s)\n```\n\nThis code follows the exact steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It prompts the user to enter two integer values using the `input()` function and converts the input strings to integers using `int()`.\n2. It calculates the modulus of the two numbers using the modulus operator (`%`).\n3. It prints the result to the console using the `print()` function.\n\nNote that I've added some additional text to the `print()` statement to make the output more readable, but this is not strictly necessary to meet the specification.",
