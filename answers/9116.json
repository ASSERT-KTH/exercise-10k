  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary of meteorological data as input, where the keys are the names of cities and the values are dictionaries with temperature and humidity data. The inner dictionaries should have 'temperature' and 'humidity' as keys. The program should calculate and return the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find_hottest_and_most_humid_city(meteorological_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.\n\n    Args:\n        meteorological_data (dict): A dictionary of meteorological data where the keys are the names of cities and the values are dictionaries with 'temperature' and 'humidity' as keys.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not meteorological_data:\n        return None, None\n\n    hottest_city = max(meteorological_data, key=lambda city: meteorological_data[city]['temperature'])\n    most_humid_city = max(meteorological_data, key=lambda city: meteorological_data[city]['humidity'])\n\n    return hottest_city, most_humid_city\n\n# Example usage:\nmeteorological_data = {\n    'New York': {'temperature': 20, 'humidity': 60},\n    'Los Angeles': {'temperature': 25, 'humidity': 50},\n    'Chicago': {'temperature': 18, 'humidity': 70},\n    'Houston': {'temperature': 22, 'humidity': 80}\n}\n\nhottest_city, most_humid_city = find_hottest_and_most_humid_city(meteorological_data)\n\nprint(f'Hottest city: {hottest_city}')\nprint(f'Most humid city: {most_humid_city}')\n```\nThis code defines the `find_hottest_and_most_humid_city` function, which takes a dictionary of meteorological data as input and returns a tuple containing the city with the highest temperature and the city with the highest humidity. The function uses the `max` function with a lambda function as the `key` argument to find the cities with the highest temperature and humidity. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function with a sample dictionary of meteorological data and print the results.",
