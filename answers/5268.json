  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the discount amount based on the price and discount percentage using conditional statements. It checks if the discount percentage is within a valid range (0-100) and calculates the discount amount accordingly.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount amount based on the price and discount percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discount amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if discount_percentage < 0 or discount_percentage > 100:\n        print(\"Invalid discount percentage. Please enter a value between 0 and 100.\")\n        return None\n    else:\n        discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100)\n        return discount_amount\n\ndef main():\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price of the item: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    discount_amount = calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage)\n\n    if discount_amount is not None:\n        print(f\"Discount amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Price after discount: ${price - discount_amount:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter a valid price and discount percentage:\n    *   Price: 100\n    *   Discount percentage: 20\n    *   Output: Discount amount: $20.00, Price after discount: $80.00\n*   Enter an invalid discount percentage:\n    *   Price: 100\n    *   Discount percentage: 120\n    *   Output: Invalid discount percentage. Please enter a value between 0 and 100.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The `calculate_discount` function takes two arguments: `price` and `discount_percentage`.\n2.  It checks if the `discount_percentage` is within the valid range (0-100) using a conditional statement.\n3.  If the `discount_percentage` is valid, it calculates the `discount_amount` by multiplying the `price` with the `discount_percentage` divided by 100.\n4.  The `main` function prompts the user to enter the price and discount percentage.\n5.  It calls the `calculate_discount` function with the user-input values and stores the result in the `discount_amount` variable.\n6.  If the `discount_amount` is not `None`, it prints the discount amount and the price after applying the discount.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Always validate user input to ensure it falls within the expected range.\n*   Use conditional statements to handle different scenarios and provide informative error messages.\n*   Consider using a `try-except` block to handle potential exceptions, such as invalid input types.",
