  "answer": "### Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Function\n#### Overview\n\nThis function determines the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It takes two inputs, the choices of the two players, and returns a string indicating the winner.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the winner of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\n\n    Args:\n        player1_choice (str): The choice of player 1. Can be \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\".\n        player2_choice (str): The choice of player 2. Can be \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\".\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The winner of the game. Can be \"player 1\", \"player 2\", or \"tie\".\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the winning conditions\n    winning_conditions = {\n        \"rock\": \"scissors\",\n        \"paper\": \"rock\",\n        \"scissors\": \"paper\"\n    }\n\n    # Check if the inputs are valid\n    if player1_choice not in winning_conditions or player2_choice not in winning_conditions:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.\")\n\n    # Check if it's a tie\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return \"tie\"\n\n    # Check if player 1 wins\n    if winning_conditions[player1_choice] == player2_choice:\n        return \"player 1\"\n\n    # If none of the above conditions are met, player 2 wins\n    return \"player 2\"\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(determine_winner(\"rock\", \"scissors\"))  # Should print \"player 1\"\n    print(determine_winner(\"paper\", \"rock\"))  # Should print \"player 1\"\n    print(determine_winner(\"scissors\", \"paper\"))  # Should print \"player 1\"\n    print(determine_winner(\"rock\", \"rock\"))  # Should print \"tie\"\n    print(determine_winner(\"scissors\", \"rock\"))  # Should print \"player 2\"\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The function `determine_winner` takes two arguments, `player1_choice` and `player2_choice`, which represent the choices of the two players.\n*   It uses a dictionary `winning_conditions` to define the winning conditions for each choice.\n*   It checks if the inputs are valid and raises a `ValueError` if they are not.\n*   It checks if the game is a tie and returns \"tie\" if the choices are the same.\n*   It checks if player 1 wins by comparing their choice with the winning condition for that choice.\n*   If none of the above conditions are met, it returns \"player 2\" as the winner.",
