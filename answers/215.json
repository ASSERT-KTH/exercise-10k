  "answer": "**Number Guessing Game Function**\n================================\n\nHere's a simple implementation of a number guessing game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple number guessing game.\n    \n    The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.\n    The player has 6 attempts to guess the number.\n    After each guess, the computer tells the player if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum number of attempts\n    max_attempts = 6\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is a valid integer\n        if not user_guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Convert the user's guess to an integer\n        user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the valid range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            return\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low. Try again!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high. Try again!\")\n        \n        # Print the remaining attempts\n        print(f\"You have {max_attempts - attempts} attempts remaining.\")\n    \n    # If the user runs out of attempts, reveal the number\n    print(f\"Sorry, you didn't find the number. The number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n--------------------\n\n1. The `number_guessing_game` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint`.\n2. The function initializes the number of attempts and the maximum number of attempts.\n3. The function enters a loop where it asks the user for their guess, checks if the guess is valid, and increments the number of attempts.\n4. If the user's guess is correct, the function congratulates the user and ends.\n5. If the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number, the function provides feedback and continues the loop.\n6. If the user runs out of attempts, the function reveals the number and ends.",
