  "prompt": "Write a program that takes three numbers as input and performs the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print out the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n// Author: [Your Name]\n// Date: [Today's Date]\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int num1, num2, num3, add, sub, mul, divi;\n\n    cout << \"Enter 1st number: \";\n    cin >> num1;\n    cout << \"Enter 2nd number: \";\n    cin >> num2;\n    cout << \"Enter 3rd number: \";\n    cin >> num3;\n\n    // Perform operations\n    add = num1 + num2 + num3;\n    sub = num1 - num2 - num3;\n    mul = num1 * num2 * num3;\n    divi = num1 / num2 / num3;\n\n    // Print results\n    cout << \"Addition: \" << add << endl;\n    cout << \"Subtraction: \" << sub << endl;\n    cout << \"Multiplication: \" << mul << endl;\n    cout << \"Division: \" << divi << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank, as they should be filled in by the programmer. Also, I've used the `endl` statement to insert a newline character after each output, as is common in C++ programming. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
