  "answer": "### Finding the Youngest Student\n\nTo find the youngest student in a dictionary, you can use the `min()` function with a generator expression to iterate over the dictionary's values and find the minimum age. Then, you can use a list comprehension to find the students with that minimum age.\n\n#### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_youngest_student(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the youngest student(s) in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the youngest student(s) and their age.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the dictionary is empty\n    if not students:\n        return None\n\n    # Find the minimum age\n    min_age = min(students.values())\n\n    # Find the students with the minimum age\n    youngest_students = [(name, age) for name, age in students.items() if age == min_age]\n\n    return youngest_students\n\n# Example usage\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 20,\n    \"Charlie\": 25\n}\n\nyoungest_students = find_youngest_student(students)\n\nif youngest_students:\n    print(\"The youngest student(s) is/are:\")\n    for student in youngest_students:\n        print(f\"{student[0]} - {student[1]} years old\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No students found.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function `find_youngest_student()` takes a dictionary `students` as input.\n2. It checks if the dictionary is empty and returns `None` if it is.\n3. It finds the minimum age using the `min()` function with a generator expression.\n4. It finds the students with the minimum age using a list comprehension.\n5. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name and age of a youngest student.\n6. In the example usage, it creates a dictionary `students` with some sample data and calls the `find_youngest_student()` function to find the youngest student(s).",
