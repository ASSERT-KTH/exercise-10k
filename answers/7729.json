  "answer": "**Finding Substrings with K Distinct Characters**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a string `s` and an integer `k`, find all substrings of `s` that contain exactly `k` distinct characters.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using a sliding window approach with the help of an unordered map to keep track of the frequency of each character in the current window.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef find_substrings_with_k_distinct_characters(s, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all substrings of `s` that contain exactly `k` distinct characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n        k (int): The number of distinct characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of substrings with `k` distinct characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        char_freq = defaultdict(int)\n        distinct_chars = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\n            if char_freq[s[j]] == 0:\n                distinct_chars += 1\n            char_freq[s[j]] += 1\n            if distinct_chars == k:\n                result.append(s[i:j+1])\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ns = \"abcabc\"\nk = 2\nprint(find_substrings_with_k_distinct_characters(s, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize an empty list `result` to store the substrings with `k` distinct characters.\n2.  Iterate over the string `s` using two nested loops to generate all possible substrings.\n3.  For each substring, use an unordered map `char_freq` to keep track of the frequency of each character.\n4.  Initialize a variable `distinct_chars` to count the number of distinct characters in the current substring.\n5.  Iterate over the characters in the substring and update the frequency of each character in `char_freq`.\n6.  If the frequency of a character is 0 before incrementing, increment `distinct_chars` to count the new distinct character.\n7.  If `distinct_chars` equals `k`, append the current substring to the `result` list.\n8.  Finally, return the `result` list containing all substrings with `k` distinct characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 \\* m), where n is the length of the string and m is the average length of the substrings. This is because we are generating all possible substrings and then iterating over each substring to count the distinct characters.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are storing the substrings with `k` distinct characters in the `result` list, which can contain up to n substrings in the worst case. Additionally, the `char_freq` map can contain up to n characters in the worst case.",
