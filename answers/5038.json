  "answer": "**Employee Database Simulator**\n================================\n\nThis program is designed to simulate an employee database, allowing users to add, remove, and view employee information.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, department):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.department = department\n\nclass EmployeeDatabase:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.employees = []\n\n    def add_employee(self, name, age, department):\n        new_employee = Employee(name, age, department)\n        self.employees.append(new_employee)\n        print(f\"{name} added to the database.\")\n\n    def remove_employee(self, name):\n        for employee in self.employees:\n            if employee.name.lower() == name.lower():\n                self.employees.remove(employee)\n                print(f\"{name} removed from the database.\")\n                return\n        print(f\"{name} not found in the database.\")\n\n    def view_employees(self):\n        for i, employee in enumerate(self.employees):\n            print(f\"Employee {i+1}:\")\n            print(f\"Name: {employee.name}\")\n            print(f\"Age: {employee.age}\")\n            print(f\"Department: {employee.department}\")\n            print(\"------------------------\")\n\ndef main():\n    database = EmployeeDatabase()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"Employee Database Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Employee\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Employee\")\n        print(\"3. View Employees\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            name = input(\"Enter employee name: \")\n            age = int(input(\"Enter employee age: \"))\n            department = input(\"Enter employee department: \")\n            database.add_employee(name, age, department)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter employee name to remove: \")\n            database.remove_employee(name)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            database.view_employees()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The program defines two classes: `Employee` and `EmployeeDatabase`.\n2. The `Employee` class represents an individual employee with attributes for name, age, and department.\n3. The `EmployeeDatabase` class represents the database itself, with methods to add, remove, and view employees.\n4. The `main` function creates an instance of the `EmployeeDatabase` class and presents a menu to the user.\n5. The user can choose to add an employee, remove an employee, view all employees, or exit the program.\n6. The program uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n7. The `for` loop is used to iterate over the list of employees when viewing or removing employees.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Add an employee: Choose option 1, enter the employee's name, age, and department.\n* Remove an employee: Choose option 2, enter the employee's name to remove.\n* View all employees: Choose option 3 to display a list of all employees in the database.\n* Exit the program: Choose option 4 to exit the program.",
