  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all elements from both arrays.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two input arrays into a new array, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef combine_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing all elements from both arrays.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr1 (list): The first input array.\n    arr2 (list): The second input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new array containing all elements from both input arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(arr1, list) or not isinstance(arr2, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be lists.\")\n\n    # We initialize an empty list to store the combined array.\n    # This list will be returned at the end of the function.\n    combined_array = []\n\n    # We use the extend method to add all elements from the first array to the combined array.\n    # This is more efficient than using the + operator because it modifies the list in-place.\n    combined_array.extend(arr1)\n\n    # We use the extend method again to add all elements from the second array to the combined array.\n    combined_array.extend(arr2)\n\n    # Finally, we return the combined array.\n    return combined_array\n\n# Example usage:\narray1 = [1, 2, 3]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(combine_arrays(array1, array2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `combine_arrays` starts by validating if both inputs `arr1` and `arr2` are lists. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n* An empty list `combined_array` is initialized to store the merged elements from both input arrays.\n* The function utilizes the `extend` method to add all elements from `arr1` and `arr2` to `combined_array`. This approach is more efficient than using the `+` operator because it modifies the list in-place.\n* Finally, the function returns the `combined_array`, which contains all elements from both input arrays.",
