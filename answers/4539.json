  "answer": "**Matrix Transpose Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a 2D array as input and returns the transposed array. The transpose of a matrix is an operator which can be thought of as \"swapping\" the rows and columns for a matrix.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef transpose(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the transpose of a given 2D array.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): A 2D list of elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The transposed 2D list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a sample 2D array\n    matrix = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n\n    # Print the original matrix\n    print(\"Original Matrix:\")\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(row)\n\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)\n\n    # Print the transposed matrix\n    print(\"\\nTransposed Matrix:\")\n    for row in transposed_matrix:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `transpose` function uses Python's built-in `zip` function with the `*` operator to unpack the input matrix.\n*   The `zip` function groups the elements from each row of the input matrix into tuples, effectively transposing the matrix.\n*   The `map` function is used to convert the tuples returned by `zip` back into lists.\n*   The `list` function is used to convert the map object into a list of lists, which represents the transposed matrix.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal Matrix:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[7, 8, 9]\n\nTransposed Matrix:\n[1, 4, 7]\n[2, 5, 8]\n[3, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution Using NumPy\n\nIf you're working with large matrices, you may want to consider using the NumPy library, which provides an efficient `transpose` function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transpose(matrix):\n    return np.transpose(matrix).tolist()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    matrix = np.array([\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ])\n\n    transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)\n    print(transposed_matrix)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]\n```",
