  "answer": "Certainly! I'll provide a comprehensive response to help you understand how to implement a function that uses assertions to verify the correctness of its input or internal state. This response will include a brief introduction, an action plan, and an explanation of the code. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is a list. If it's not, we raise an AssertionError.\n    assert isinstance(numbers, list), \"Input must be a list\"\n\n    # Then, we check if the list is not empty. If it is, we raise an AssertionError.\n    assert len(numbers) > 0, \"List cannot be empty\"\n\n    # Next, we check if all elements in the list are numbers. If any element is not a number, we raise an AssertionError.\n    assert all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers), \"All elements in the list must be numbers\"\n\n    # Now that we've verified the correctness of our input, we can calculate the average.\n    # We use the sum function to add up all the numbers in the list, and then divide by the length of the list.\n    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated average.\n    return average\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average` starts by validating its input using assertions. It first checks if the input `numbers` is a list using `assert isinstance(numbers, list)`.\n* It then checks if the list is not empty using `assert len(numbers) > 0`, and if all elements in the list are numbers using `assert all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers)`.\n* If the input is valid, the function calculates the average by summing up all the numbers in the list using `sum(numbers)` and dividing by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated average.",
