  "prompt": "Create a function that calculates a student's grade based on their score. The grade should be 'A' for scores above 90, 'B' for scores between 80 and 90, 'C' for scores between 70 and 80, 'D' for scores between 60 and 70, and 'F' for scores below 60.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates a student's grade based on their score, following the specific grade thresholds you've provided. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n    \n    The grade is determined by the following criteria:\n    - 'A' for scores above 90\n    - 'B' for scores between 80 and 90\n    - 'C' for scores between 70 and 80\n    - 'D' for scores between 60 and 70\n    - 'F' for scores below 60\n\n    Parameters:\n    score (float): The student's score\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The student's grade\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the score is above 90 to assign an 'A' grade\n    if score > 90:\n        return 'A'\n    \n    # If the score is not above 90, we check if it's between 80 and 90 to assign a 'B' grade\n    elif 80 <= score <= 90:\n        return 'B'\n    \n    # If the score is not between 80 and 90, we check if it's between 70 and 80 to assign a 'C' grade\n    elif 70 <= score < 80:\n        return 'C'\n    \n    # If the score is not between 70 and 80, we check if it's between 60 and 70 to assign a 'D' grade\n    elif 60 <= score < 70:\n        return 'D'\n    \n    # If the score is not between 60 and 70, it must be below 60, so we assign an 'F' grade\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_grade(95))  # Should print 'A'\nprint(calculate_grade(85))  # Should print 'B'\nprint(calculate_grade(75))  # Should print 'C'\nprint(calculate_grade(65))  # Should print 'D'\nprint(calculate_grade(55))  # Should print 'F'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_grade` function takes a `score` as input and uses if-elif-else statements to determine the corresponding grade based on the given criteria.\n* Each condition checks the score against specific thresholds (e.g., `score > 90` for an 'A' grade) and returns the appropriate grade as a string.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a clear description of its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier for users to understand how to use it.\n* Example use cases are provided at the end of the code to demonstrate how to use the `calculate_grade` function with different scores and verify its correctness.",
