  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num1 (float): The first number\n    num2 (float): The second number\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The sum of num1 and num2\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Test the function\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", result)\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. We then ask the user to input two numbers, call the `add_numbers` function with these numbers, and print the result. The `float` function is used to convert the user's input into a floating-point number, so that the program can handle decimal numbers.",
