  "answer": "### Creating a Tuple to Store Student Information\n#### Code\n```python\n# Define a function to create and print student information\ndef print_student_info():\n    # Create a tuple to store student information\n    student_info = (\"John Doe\", 20, \"Computer Science\", 3.8)\n\n    # Print out the student information\n    print(\"Student Name:\", student_info[0])\n    print(\"Age:\", student_info[1])\n    print(\"Major:\", student_info[2])\n    print(\"GPA:\", student_info[3])\n\n# Call the function to print student information\nprint_student_info()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   We define a function `print_student_info()` to create and print student information.\n*   Inside the function, we create a tuple `student_info` to store the student's name, age, major, and GPA.\n*   We then print out the student information by accessing each element in the tuple using its index.\n*   Finally, we call the `print_student_info()` function to execute the code and print the student information.\n\n#### Output\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nAge: 20\nMajor: Computer Science\nGPA: 3.8\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use named tuples for better readability and maintainability:\n\n#### Using Named Tuples\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define a function to create and print student information\ndef print_student_info():\n    # Create a named tuple to store student information\n    Student = namedtuple(\"Student\", [\"name\", \"age\", \"major\", \"gpa\"])\n    student_info = Student(\"John Doe\", 20, \"Computer Science\", 3.8)\n\n    # Print out the student information\n    print(\"Student Name:\", student_info.name)\n    print(\"Age:\", student_info.age)\n    print(\"Major:\", student_info.major)\n    print(\"GPA:\", student_info.gpa)\n\n# Call the function to print student information\nprint_student_info()\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to access the tuple elements by their names instead of indices, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.",
