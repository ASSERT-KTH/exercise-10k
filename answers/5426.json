  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given year is a leap year or not. A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.\n2. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the year is divisible by 4. If the remainder is 0, the year is a leap year.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if it's a leap year using the `is_leap_year` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a simplified definition of a leap year, which is not entirely accurate. In the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. For a more accurate implementation, you can modify the `is_leap_year` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n```",
