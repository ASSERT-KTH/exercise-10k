  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the LCM of two numbers using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the LCM to the maximum of the two numbers\n    lcm = max(num1, num2)\n\n    # Continue to increment the LCM until it is divisible by both numbers\n    while True:\n        if lcm % num1 == 0 and lcm % num2 == 0:\n            break\n        lcm += 1\n\n    return lcm\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 12\nnum2 = 15\nlcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n```\n\nThis program works by initializing the LCM to the maximum of the two input numbers, and then incrementing it until it is divisible by both numbers. This is done using a while loop that checks whether the current LCM is divisible by both numbers, and if not, increments it by 1.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  Initialize the LCM to the maximum of `num1` and `num2`.\n2.  Enter a while loop that continues until the LCM is divisible by both `num1` and `num2`.\n3.  Inside the loop, check if the current LCM is divisible by both `num1` and `num2` using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4.  If the LCM is divisible by both numbers, break out of the loop.\n5.  Otherwise, increment the LCM by 1 and repeat the loop.\n6.  Once the loop exits, return the calculated LCM.\n\nThis approach ensures that the LCM is calculated correctly using a simple and efficient while loop.",
