  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a string as input and returns its length.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the length of a given string input. This function will take a string as an argument and return the number of characters in the string. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'string_length' that takes one argument 'input_string'.\ndef string_length(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the length of a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The length of the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input is indeed a string. If not, raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(input_string, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n\n    # Use the built-in len() function in Python to calculate the length of the string.\n    # The len() function returns the number of items in an object.\n    length = len(input_string)\n\n    # Return the calculated length.\n    return length\n\n# Test the function with a sample string.\nprint(string_length(\"Hello, World!\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `string_length` is defined with a parameter `input_string` to accept the input string. It includes a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and return values.\n* Inside the function, a check is performed using `isinstance(input_string, str)` to ensure the input is a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with a message indicating that the input must be a string.\n* The `len()` function is used to calculate the length of the `input_string`. This built-in Python function returns the number of items in an object, which for a string, corresponds to the number of characters.\n* Finally, the calculated length is returned by the function, and an example usage is demonstrated by calling the function with the string \"Hello, World!\" and printing the result.",
