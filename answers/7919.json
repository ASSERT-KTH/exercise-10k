  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in a 2D Plane**\n\nBelow is a Python program to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as (x, y).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as (x, y).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the coordinates of the two points\n    point1 = (1, 2)\n    point2 = (4, 6)\n\n    # Calculate the distance between the two points\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f} units.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes two points as input and returns the distance between them.\n*   The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: `\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n*   In the `main` function, we define the coordinates of two points and calculate the distance between them using the `calculate_distance` function.\n*   The result is printed to the console with two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculating the distance between two cities on a map\n*   Determining the distance between two objects in a game or simulation\n*   Measuring the distance between two points in a graph or chart\n\n### Running the Code\n\nTo run the code, save it in a file named `distance_calculator.py` and execute it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython distance_calculator.py\n```",
