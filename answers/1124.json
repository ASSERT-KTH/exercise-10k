  "answer": "**Rock Paper Scissors Game**\n==========================\n\nThis program simulates a game of Rock Paper Scissors between two players. The game can be played in two modes: manual input (where players enter their choices manually) and random input (where the computer generates random choices for the players).\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_player_choice(player_name, mode):\n    \"\"\"Get the choice of a player.\"\"\"\n    if mode == \"manual\":\n        while True:\n            choice = input(f\"{player_name}, enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): \")\n            if choice.lower() in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n                return choice.lower()\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n    elif mode == \"random\":\n        return random.choice([\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"])\n\ndef determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if player1_choice == player2_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player1_choice == \"rock\" and player2_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"scissors\" and player2_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (player1_choice == \"paper\" and player2_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"Player 1 wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Player 2 wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock Paper Scissors.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n    mode = input(\"Do you want to play in manual or random mode? \")\n    while mode not in [\"manual\", \"random\"]:\n        print(\"Invalid mode. Please enter 'manual' or 'random'.\")\n        mode = input(\"Do you want to play in manual or random mode? \")\n    \n    player1_name = input(\"Enter Player 1's name: \")\n    player2_name = input(\"Enter Player 2's name: \")\n\n    player1_choice = get_player_choice(player1_name, mode)\n    player2_choice = get_player_choice(player2_name, mode)\n\n    print(f\"\\n{player1_name} chose: {player1_choice}\")\n    print(f\"{player2_name} chose: {player2_choice}\")\n\n    print(determine_winner(player1_choice, player2_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo play the game, simply run the program and follow the prompts. You will be asked to choose the game mode, enter the names of the players, and (if playing in manual mode) enter the choices of the players. The program will then determine the winner and print the result.\n\n```\nWelcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\nDo you want to play in manual or random mode? manual\nEnter Player 1's name: Alice\nEnter Player 1, enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): rock\nEnter Player 2's name: Bob\nEnter Player 2, enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): scissors\n\nAlice chose: rock\nBob chose: scissors\nPlayer 1 wins!\n```\n\nNote: This is a simple implementation of the game and does not include any error handling or validation of input beyond what is necessary to ensure the game can be played.",
