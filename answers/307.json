  "answer": "**Search Element in Array Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function searches for a specific element in a given array and returns its index. If the element is not found, it returns -1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef search_element(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a specific element in a given array and returns its index.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The array to search in.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the index method to find the index of the target element\n        index = array.index(target)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the target element is not found, return -1\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    target = 3\n    index = search_element(array, target)\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `search_element` takes two parameters: `array` and `target`.\n2. It uses the `index` method of the `array` to find the index of the `target` element.\n3. If the `target` element is found, its index is returned.\n4. If the `target` element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n5. In the example usage, we create an array and a target element, and then call the `search_element` function to find the index of the target element.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function uses the `index` method, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. For large arrays, a more efficient search algorithm like binary search may be necessary. However, for small to medium-sized arrays, this function should be sufficient.",
