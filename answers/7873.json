  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that plays a guessing game with a limited number of attempts.\n\n```python\n# Import the random module\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Define the number of attempts\n    attempts = 5\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(f\"You have {attempts} attempts to guess the number.\")\n\n    # Loop until the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts\n    for i in range(attempts):\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is a valid number\n        if not user_guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Convert the user's guess to an integer\n        user_guess = int(user_guess)\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {i+1} attempts.\")\n            return\n\n        # If the user's guess is not correct, give them a hint\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try a higher number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high! Try a lower number.\")\n\n        # Print the remaining attempts\n        print(f\"You have {attempts-i-1} attempts left.\")\n\n    # If the user runs out of attempts, they lose\n    print(f\"Sorry, you didn't guess the number. The number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\n# Call the function to start the game\nguessing_game()\n```\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has a limited number of attempts (5 in this case) to guess the number. After each guess, the program gives the user a hint, telling them if their guess was too high or too low. If the user guesses the number correctly before running out of attempts, they win the game. If they run out of attempts without guessing the number, they lose.",
