  "answer": "**Boolean Variables in Conditional Statements**\n====================================================\n\nBelow is an example program written in Python that demonstrates the use of boolean variables in conditional statements.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to demonstrate boolean variables in conditional statements\ndef boolean_variables_demo():\n    # Initialize boolean variables\n    is_admin = True\n    is_logged_in = False\n    is_user_active = True\n\n    # Conditional statement using boolean variables\n    if is_admin and is_logged_in:\n        print(\"Welcome, Admin! You are logged in and active.\")\n    elif is_admin and not is_logged_in:\n        print(\"Welcome, Admin! However, you need to log in to access your account.\")\n    elif not is_admin and is_logged_in:\n        if is_user_active:\n            print(\"Welcome, User! You are logged in and active.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Welcome, User! However, your account is inactive.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You need to log in to access your account.\")\n\n    # Conditional statement using boolean variables in a loop\n    users = [\n        {\"name\": \"John\", \"is_admin\": True, \"is_logged_in\": True, \"is_active\": True},\n        {\"name\": \"Jane\", \"is_admin\": False, \"is_logged_in\": True, \"is_active\": True},\n        {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"is_admin\": True, \"is_logged_in\": False, \"is_active\": True},\n    ]\n\n    for user in users:\n        if user[\"is_admin\"] and user[\"is_logged_in\"]:\n            print(f\"Welcome, Admin {user['name']}! You are logged in and active.\")\n        elif user[\"is_admin\"] and not user[\"is_logged_in\"]:\n            print(f\"Welcome, Admin {user['name']}! However, you need to log in to access your account.\")\n        elif not user[\"is_admin\"] and user[\"is_logged_in\"]:\n            if user[\"is_active\"]:\n                print(f\"Welcome, User {user['name']}! You are logged in and active.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Welcome, User {user['name']}! However, your account is inactive.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"You need to log in to access your account, {user['name']}.\")\n\n# Call the function to demonstrate boolean variables in conditional statements\nboolean_variables_demo()\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nWelcome, Admin! However, you need to log in to access your account.\nWelcome, Admin John! You are logged in and active.\nWelcome, User Jane! You are logged in and active.\nWelcome, Admin Bob! However, you need to log in to access your account.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function `boolean_variables_demo` to demonstrate boolean variables in conditional statements.\n*   Inside the function, we initialize boolean variables `is_admin`, `is_logged_in`, and `is_user_active` to represent different user states.\n*   We use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to check the boolean variables and print corresponding messages based on the user's state.\n*   We also demonstrate using boolean variables in a loop by iterating over a list of user dictionaries, each containing boolean fields (`is_admin`, `is_logged_in`, and `is_active`).\n*   Finally, we call the `boolean_variables_demo` function to execute the demonstration.",
