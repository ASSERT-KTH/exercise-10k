  "prompt": "Create a program that reads a line of input from the user and prints it out a specified number of times.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef print_line_n_times():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a line of input from the user and prints it out a specified number of times.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read a line of input from the user\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a line of text: \")\n\n    # Ask the user how many times to print the line\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num_times = int(input(\"How many times would you like to print the line? \"))\n            if num_times <= 0:\n                print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Print the line the specified number of times\n    for _ in range(num_times):\n        print(user_input)\n\n# Call the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_line_n_times()\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter a line of text when prompted (e.g., \"Hello, world!\").\n3. Enter the number of times you want to print the line when prompted (e.g., 3).\n4. The program will print the line the specified number of times.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\nPlease enter a line of text: Hello, world!\nHow many times would you like to print the line? 3\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\n```",
