  "prompt": "Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. The function should take in an array of integers as input and return an array of the next greater elements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef next_greater_element(nums):\n    stack = deque()\n    res = [-1] * len(nums)\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:\n            res[stack.pop()] = nums[i]\n        stack.append(i)\n    \n    return res\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [2, 1, -1]\nprint(next_greater_element(nums))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]\n```\nThis code uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the elements in the input array, and an array `res` to store the next greater element for each element. The function iterates over the input array, comparing each element with the top element of the stack and updating the `res` array accordingly. Finally, it returns the `res` array containing the next greater elements for each element in the input array.",
