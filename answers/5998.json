  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**\n======================================\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The function `gcd` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n*   The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero.\n*   The `abs` function is used to ensure the result is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `gcd` function with two numbers and print the result.\n\n**Alternative Implementation:**\n\nIf you prefer to use the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library (available in Python 3.5 and later), you can implement the function as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n```",
