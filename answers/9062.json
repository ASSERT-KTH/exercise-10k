  "answer": "**Simple Game Program**\n=======================\n\nThis program lets the user play a simple game where they have to guess a number between 1 and 100. If they guess the correct number, they win; otherwise, they lose.\n\n**Code**\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (yes/no): \")\n            if play_again.lower() == \"yes\":\n                game()\n            else:\n                print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n**How to Play**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt you to guess it.\n3. Enter your guess.\n4. If your guess is too low or too high, the program will tell you and ask you to guess again.\n5. If you guess the correct number, you win and the program will ask you if you want to play again.\n6. If you want to quit, type \"quit\" and press Enter.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* The user guesses the correct number on the first try:\n\t+ Program output: \"Congratulations! You guessed the number in 1 attempts.\"\n* The user guesses a number that is too low:\n\t+ Program output: \"Too low! Try again.\"\n* The user guesses a number that is too high:\n\t+ Program output: \"Too high! Try again.\"\n* The user wants to quit:\n\t+ Program output: \"Thanks for playing!\"",
