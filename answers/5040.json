  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects using for loops:\n\n```python\n# Define the subjects and their respective scores\nsubjects = [\"Maths\", \"Science\", \"English\", \"History\", \"Geography\"]\nscores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]\n\n# Define the grade thresholds\ngrade_thresholds = {\n    \"A\": (90, 100),\n    \"B\": (80, 89),\n    \"C\": (70, 79),\n    \"D\": (60, 69),\n    \"F\": (0, 59)\n}\n\n# Function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    for grade, threshold in grade_thresholds.items():\n        if threshold[0] <= score <= threshold[1]:\n            return grade\n\n# Calculate the grade for each subject\nfor i in range(len(subjects)):\n    subject = subjects[i]\n    score = scores[i]\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"Subject: {subject}, Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")\n\n# Calculate the overall grade\ntotal_score = sum(scores)\naverage_score = total_score / len(scores)\noverall_grade = calculate_grade(average_score)\nprint(f\"Overall Average Score: {average_score:.2f}, Overall Grade: {overall_grade}\")\n```\n\nThis program first defines the subjects and their respective scores, and then defines the grade thresholds. It then uses a for loop to calculate the grade for each subject and prints the subject, score, and grade. Finally, it calculates the overall grade by averaging the scores and prints the overall average score and grade.\n\nExample output:\n```\nSubject: Maths, Score: 85, Grade: B\nSubject: Science, Score: 90, Grade: A\nSubject: English, Score: 78, Grade: C\nSubject: History, Score: 92, Grade: A\nSubject: Geography, Score: 88, Grade: B\nOverall Average Score: 86.60, Overall Grade: B\n```",
