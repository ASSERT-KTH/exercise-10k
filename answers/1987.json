  "answer": "**Weather Forecast Program**\n================================\n\nThis program determines the weather forecast based on the temperature using conditional statements.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef get_weather_forecast(temperature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the weather forecast based on the temperature.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The weather forecast.\n    \"\"\"\n    if temperature < 0:\n        return \"Freezing\"\n    elif temperature < 10:\n        return \"Cold\"\n    elif temperature < 20:\n        return \"Cool\"\n    elif temperature < 25:\n        return \"Mild\"\n    elif temperature < 30:\n        return \"Warm\"\n    elif temperature < 35:\n        return \"Hot\"\n    else:\n        return \"Extremely Hot\"\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature in Celsius: \"))\n    forecast = get_weather_forecast(temperature)\n    print(f\"The weather forecast is: {forecast}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `get_weather_forecast` function takes a temperature as input and returns the corresponding weather forecast.\n2. The function uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the weather forecast based on the temperature.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the temperature, calls the `get_weather_forecast` function, and prints the result.\n4. The program uses a simple and intuitive temperature scale:\n\t* Freezing: below 0\u00b0C\n\t* Cold: 0\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C\n\t* Cool: 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C\n\t* Mild: 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C\n\t* Warm: 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C\n\t* Hot: 30\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C\n\t* Extremely Hot: above 35\u00b0C\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a temperature of 15\u00b0C to get the forecast: \"Cool\"\n* Enter a temperature of 28\u00b0C to get the forecast: \"Warm\"\n* Enter a temperature of -5\u00b0C to get the forecast: \"Freezing\"\n\nNote: This program uses a simple temperature scale and does not take into account other factors that may affect the weather forecast, such as humidity, wind, or precipitation.",
