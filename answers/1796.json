  "answer": "### Symmetric Difference of Two Dictionaries\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the symmetric difference of two dictionaries:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in either dictionary but not in both.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the symmetric difference of dict1 and dict2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a new dictionary to store the symmetric difference\n    symmetric_diff = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the key-value pairs in dict1\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # If the key is not in dict2, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict2:\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value\n\n    # Iterate over the key-value pairs in dict2\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # If the key is not in dict1, add it to the symmetric difference\n        if key not in dict1:\n            symmetric_diff[key] = value\n\n    # Return the symmetric difference\n    return symmetric_diff\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nprint(symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the key-value pairs in each dictionary and adding the pairs to the symmetric difference if they are not present in the other dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, you can use dictionary comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that exist in either dictionary but not in both.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary containing the symmetric difference of dict1 and dict2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {key: dict1[key] for key in dict1 if key not in dict2} | {key: dict2[key] for key in dict2 if key not in dict1}\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\nprint(symmetric_difference(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}\n```\n\nNote that this implementation will use the value from `dict1` for keys that are present in both dictionaries but have different values. If you want to use the value from `dict2` instead, you can swap the order of the dictionaries in the dictionary comprehension.",
