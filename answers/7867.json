  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime using conditional statements. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False  # If the number is divisible by any number, it's not prime\n    return True  # If the number is not divisible by any number, it's prime\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's prime.\n2. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it's not prime.\n3. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of these values.\n4. If the number is divisible by any of these values, it's not prime, and the function returns `False`.\n5. If the number is not divisible by any of these values, it's prime, and the function returns `True`.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a prime number, such as 23: The program will output \"23 is a prime number.\"\n* Enter a non-prime number, such as 30: The program will output \"30 is not a prime number.\"",
