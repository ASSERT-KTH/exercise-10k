  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that demonstrates variable reassignment:\n\n```python\n# Variable Reassignment Demo\ndef main():\n    # Initial variable assignment\n    x = 10\n    print(f\"Initial value of x: {x}\")\n\n    # Reassign the variable\n    x = 20\n    print(f\"Value of x after reassignment: {x}\")\n\n    # Function scope\n    def inner_function():\n        # Local variable assignment\n        y = 30\n        print(f\"Value of y inside inner_function: {y}\")\n\n        # Reassign the local variable\n        y = 40\n        print(f\"Value of y inside inner_function after reassignment: {y}\")\n\n    inner_function()\n\n    # Try to access the local variable outside the function\n    try:\n        print(f\"Value of y outside inner_function: {y}\")\n    except NameError:\n        print(\"Error: Variable y is not defined outside inner_function.\")\n\n    # Global variable assignment\n    global z\n    z = 50\n    print(f\"Value of global variable z: {z}\")\n\n    # Reassign the global variable\n    z = 60\n    print(f\"Value of global variable z after reassignment: {z}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis Python program demonstrates the concept of variable reassignment and its effects on memory and variable scope. It covers the following aspects:\n\n1.  **Initial Variable Assignment**: Assigns a value to a variable `x` and prints its initial value.\n2.  **Variable Reassignment**: Reassigns a new value to the variable `x` and prints its value after reassignment.\n3.  **Function Scope**: Defines an inner function that assigns a value to a local variable `y` and reassigns it. The program then tries to access the local variable outside the inner function, demonstrating that it's not accessible outside its scope.\n4.  **Global Variable Assignment**: Assigns a value to a global variable `z` and reassigns it, demonstrating how global variables can be accessed and modified throughout the program.\n\nOutput:\n```\nInitial value of x: 10\nValue of x after reassignment: 20\nValue of y inside inner_function: 30\nValue of y inside inner_function after reassignment: 40\nError: Variable y is not defined outside inner_function.\nValue of global variable z: 50\nValue of global variable z after reassignment: 60\n```\n\nIn terms of memory, when a variable is reassigned, the old value is not necessarily deleted from memory immediately. Instead, Python uses a mechanism called reference counting to manage memory. When the reference count of an object (in this case, the old value of the variable) reaches zero, it becomes eligible for garbage collection, and its memory is reclaimed. However, the exact timing of garbage collection is not deterministic and depends on the Python interpreter's implementation.",
