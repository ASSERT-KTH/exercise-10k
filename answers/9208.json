  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The function should handle strings of any length and should not use any built-in string reversal functions.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that reverses a given string without using built-in string reversal functions. This function will be able to handle strings of any length. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.\n    \n    It handles strings of any length and does not use any built-in string reversal functions.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    input_str (str): The input string to be reversed.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The reversed string.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the reversed string\n    reversed_str = \"\"\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current character index\n    # We start from the end of the string and move backwards to the beginning\n    i = len(input_str) - 1\n    \n    # Continue the loop until we have processed all characters in the string\n    while i >= 0:\n        # In each iteration, append the current character to the reversed string\n        # We use the index i to access the current character in the input string\n        reversed_str += input_str[i]\n        \n        # Decrement the index to move to the previous character in the next iteration\n        i -= 1\n    \n    # After the loop, the reversed string is complete, so we return it\n    return reversed_str\n\n# Test the function\nprint(reverse_string(\"Hello World\"))  # Output: \"dlroW olleH\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* We initialize an empty string `reversed_str` to store the reversed string and a variable `i` to keep track of the current character index, starting from the end of the input string.\n* We use a while loop to iterate over the input string from the end to the beginning, appending each character to `reversed_str` using `input_str[i]`.\n* After the loop, `reversed_str` contains the reversed input string, which is then returned by the function.\n* The test case `print(reverse_string(\"Hello World\"))` demonstrates the function's correctness by outputting the reversed string \"dlroW olleH\".",
