  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and number of times interest applied per time period.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial amount of money.\n        rate (float): Interest rate (in decimal).\n        time (int): Time period (in years).\n        n (int): Number of times interest applied per time period.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Final amount after compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: $\"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period (in years): \"))\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of times interest applied per time period: \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Principal: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {rate * 100:.2f}%\")\n    print(f\"Time Period: {time} years\")\n    print(f\"Number of times interest applied per time period: {n}\")\n    print(f\"Final Amount: ${final_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound Interest: ${final_amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and number of times interest applied per time period when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the final amount after compound interest, as well as the compound interest itself.\n\n### Formula\n\nThe formula used to calculate compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A is the final amount after compound interest.\n- P is the principal amount (initial amount of money).\n- r is the interest rate (in decimal).\n- n is the number of times interest applied per time period.\n- t is the time period (in years).",
