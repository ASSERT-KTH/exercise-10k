  "answer": "**Simple Chatbot Function**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python function that simulates a simple chatbot. It responds to basic user queries such as greetings, farewells, and help requests.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef chatbot(query):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a simple chatbot that responds to basic user queries.\n\n    Args:\n        query (str): The user's query.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The chatbot's response.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a dictionary of possible responses to different queries\n    responses = {\n        'greeting': [\n            'Hello! How can I assist you today?',\n            'Hi! What brings you here?',\n            'Hey! How are you doing?'\n        ],\n        'farewell': [\n            'Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.',\n            'See you later! Have a great day.',\n            'Bye! Feel free to come back anytime.'\n        ],\n        'help': [\n            'I can help you with basic queries. What do you need help with?',\n            'How can I assist you? Please provide more details.',\n            'What do you need help with? I\\'m here to assist you.'\n        ],\n        'default': [\n            'I didn\\'t quite understand that. Could you please rephrase?',\n            'Sorry, I\\'m not sure what you mean. Could you provide more context?',\n            'I\\'m not sure I understand your query. Please try again.'\n        ]\n    }\n\n    # Convert the query to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    query = query.lower()\n\n    # Check if the query is a greeting\n    if any(word in query for word in ['hello', 'hi', 'hey']):\n        return random.choice(responses['greeting'])\n\n    # Check if the query is a farewell\n    elif any(word in query for word in ['bye', 'goodbye', 'see you later']):\n        return random.choice(responses['farewell'])\n\n    # Check if the query is a help request\n    elif any(word in query for word in ['help', 'assist']):\n        return random.choice(responses['help'])\n\n    # If none of the above conditions are met, return a default response\n    else:\n        return random.choice(responses['default'])\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the simple chatbot!\")\n    while True:\n        query = input(\"You: \")\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", chatbot(query))\n        if chatbot(query).startswith('Goodbye') or chatbot(query).startswith('See you later'):\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `chatbot` function takes a user query as input and checks it against a set of predefined conditions.\n2. It uses a dictionary to store possible responses to different queries, including greetings, farewells, and help requests.\n3. The function converts the query to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison and checks if it matches any of the predefined conditions.\n4. If a match is found, the function returns a random response from the corresponding list of responses.\n5. If no match is found, the function returns a default response.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Greeting: \"Hello\" or \"Hi\"\n* Farewell: \"Bye\" or \"Goodbye\"\n* Help request: \"I need help\" or \"Can you assist me?\"",
