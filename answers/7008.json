  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and fuel consumption.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumption):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled in miles or kilometers.\n        fuel_consumption (float): The amount of fuel consumed in gallons or liters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/l).\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel_consumption == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Fuel consumption cannot be zero.\")\n\n    fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumption\n    return fuel_efficiency\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled (miles or kilometers): \"))\n    fuel_consumption = float(input(\"Enter the fuel consumption (gallons or liters): \"))\n\n    # Calculate fuel efficiency\n    try:\n        fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel_consumption)\n        print(f\"The fuel efficiency is: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/l)\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the distance traveled (e.g., 250 miles).\n3. Enter the fuel consumption (e.g., 10 gallons).\n4. The program will display the calculated fuel efficiency (e.g., 25.00 miles per gallon).\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the distance and fuel consumption are input in consistent units (e.g., miles and gallons, or kilometers and liters).\n* The fuel efficiency is calculated using the formula: `fuel_efficiency = distance / fuel_consumption`.\n* The program raises a `ValueError` if the fuel consumption is zero, as this would result in a division by zero error.",
