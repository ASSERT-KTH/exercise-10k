  "answer": "**Fruit Purchase Program**\n\n### Description\nThis program asks the user for the type of fruit they want to buy and the quantity they want to purchase. It then calculates the total cost based on the given prices.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(fruit_type, quantity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total cost of the fruit based on the given prices.\n\n    Args:\n        fruit_type (str): The type of fruit.\n        quantity (int): The quantity of fruit.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    prices = {\n        \"apples\": 1.00,\n        \"bananas\": 0.50,\n        \"oranges\": 1.50\n    }\n\n    if fruit_type in prices:\n        return prices[fruit_type] * quantity\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Available fruits: apples, bananas, oranges\")\n    fruit_type = input(\"Enter the type of fruit you want to buy: \").lower()\n    while True:\n        try:\n            quantity = int(input(\"Enter the quantity you want to purchase: \"))\n            if quantity <= 0:\n                print(\"Quantity must be a positive integer.\")\n                continue\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid quantity. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(fruit_type, quantity)\n\n    if total_cost is not None:\n        print(f\"The total cost of {quantity} {fruit_type} is: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid fruit type. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the type of fruit you want to buy (e.g., \"apples\").\n3. Enter the quantity you want to purchase (e.g., \"5\").\n4. The program will print out the total cost.\n\nNote: The program uses a dictionary to store the prices of the fruits and calculates the total cost by multiplying the price by the quantity. It also includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid fruit type and quantity.",
