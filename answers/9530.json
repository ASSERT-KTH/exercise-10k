  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, and finally print the numbers from 1 to 10 again, but this time with a '*' symbol after each number. Use either a for loop or a while loop for each part of the task.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10\nprint(\"Numbers from 1 to 10:\")\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n\n# Print numbers from 10 to 1\nprint(\"\\nNumbers from 10 to 1:\")\nfor i in range(10, 0, -1):\n    print(i)\n\n# Print numbers from 1 to 10 with '*' symbol\nprint(\"\\nNumbers from 1 to 10 with '*' symbol:\")\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(f\"{i}*\")\n```\n\nThis Python program uses `for` loops to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 and then from 10 to 1. It then uses another `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10 with a '*' symbol after each number.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the `range()` function works in this program:\n- `range(1, 11)` generates numbers from 1 to 10 (the upper limit is exclusive).\n- `range(10, 0, -1)` generates numbers from 10 to 1 (the third argument `-1` specifies the step, which in this case is decrementing by 1).\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the numbers from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, and finally from 1 to 10 with a '*' symbol after each number.",
