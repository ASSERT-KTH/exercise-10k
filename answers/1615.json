  "answer": "**GCD Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the GCD\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0.\n3. The `main` function gets two integers as input from the user, calculates their GCD using the `gcd` function, and displays the result.\n4. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input integers are negative.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 12 and 15: `gcd(12, 15)` returns 3.\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30: `gcd(24, 30)` returns 6.\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g., `gcd_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python gcd_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter two integers and view their GCD.",
