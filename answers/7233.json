  "prompt": "Create a program that uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should have separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation. The main part of the program should ask the user for two numbers and the operation they want to perform, then call the corresponding function and print the result.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code based on the specifications provided:\n```\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Function to subtract two numbers\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Function to multiply two numbers\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    return num1 * num2\n\n# Function to divide two numbers\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    if num2 == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    return num1 / num2\n\n# Main program\ndef main():\n    # Ask user for two numbers\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    # Ask user for the operation to perform\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n    choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \"))\n\n    # Perform the chosen operation\n    if choice == 1:\n        result = add(num1, num2)\n    elif choice == 2:\n        result = subtract(num1, num2)\n    elif choice == 3:\n        result = multiply(num1, num2)\n    elif choice == 4:\n        result = divide(num1, num2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n        return\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {get_operation_symbol(choice)} {num2} = {result}\")\n\n# Function to get the symbol for the chosen operation\ndef get_operation_symbol(choice):\n    if choice == 1:\n        return \"+\"\n    elif choice == 2:\n        return \"-\"\n    elif choice == 3:\n        return \"*\"\n    elif choice == 4:\n        return \"/\"\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n\n# Run the main program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the four arithmetic functions, the `main` function, and the `get_operation_symbol` function as specified. It asks the user for two numbers and the operation to perform, performs the chosen operation, and prints the result. It also handles invalid choices and division by zero.",
