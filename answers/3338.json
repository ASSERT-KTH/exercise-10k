  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two 2D arrays of integers as input and returns the sum of the two arrays, element-wise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\ndef matrix_add(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the sum of two matrices, element-wise.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> matrix_add([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n    [[6, 8], [10, 12]]\n    \"\"\"\n    return [[a + b for a, b in zip(row1, row2)] for row1, row2 in zip(A, B)]\n\n# Test the function\nA = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nB = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]\nprint(matrix_add(A, B))\n```\nI've written the code exactly as described in the specification, with the docstring, list comprehension, and test code included. The output of this code will be:\n```\n[[6, 8], [10, 12]]\n```",
