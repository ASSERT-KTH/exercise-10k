  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Given a score between 0 and 100, determine the grade based on the following conditions:\n# A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)\n\n# Define the grade function\ndef grade(score):\n    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Define a helper function to check if the input is a valid score\ndef valid_score(score):\n    return 0 <= score <= 100\n\n# Define the convert_to_letter function\ndef convert_to_letter(score):\n    # Check if the score is valid\n    if valid_score(score):\n        # Return the grade as a letter\n        return grade(score)\n    else:\n        # Return an error message if the score is not valid\n        return \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\"\n\n# Test the convert_to_letter function\nprint(convert_to_letter(90))  # Should print \"A\"\nprint(convert_to_letter(80))  # Should print \"B\"\nprint(convert_to_letter(70))  # Should print \"C\"\nprint(convert_to_letter(60))  # Should print \"D\"\nprint(convert_to_letter(50))  # Should print \"F\"\nprint(convert_to_letter(110))  # Should print \"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\"\n```\nI've followed the specifications to the letter, including the comments and the test cases. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
