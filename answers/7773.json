It can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The result of the arithmetic operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operator == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n        return num1 / num2\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator.

It performs the specified arithmetic operation on the two numbers and returns the result. The function supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It raises an error if the operator is not one of these four or if the user attempts to divide by zero.",
