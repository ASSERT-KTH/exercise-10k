  "answer": "**Rounding Down to the Nearest Integer**\n======================================\n\nBelow is an example of how to round a given number down to the nearest integer using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_down(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number down to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded down.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded down integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.floor(num)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 3.7\n    rounded_down = round_down(num)\n    print(f\"The number {num} rounded down to the nearest integer is: {rounded_down}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We import the `math` module to utilize its `floor` function, which returns the largest integer not greater than the given number.\n*   The `round_down` function takes a number as input and returns the result of `math.floor` applied to that number.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the `round_down` function by rounding the number 3.7 down to the nearest integer, which results in 3.\n\nYou can replace the `num` variable with any number you want to round down. This program will work with both positive and negative numbers.",
