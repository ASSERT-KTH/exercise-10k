  "answer": "**Declaring Variables and Printing a Greeting Message**\n\nBelow is an example code in Python that declares variables for a student's name and age, then prints out a greeting message with the student's name and age.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print a greeting message\nprint(f\"Hello, my name is {student_name} and I am {student_age} years old.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We declare two variables: `student_name` to store the student's name and `student_age` to store the student's age.\n2. We use Python's f-string formatting to print out a greeting message that includes the student's name and age.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.\n```\n\nYou can replace the values of `student_name` and `student_age` with your own values to see the greeting message with different names and ages.",
