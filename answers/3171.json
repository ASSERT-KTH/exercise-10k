  "answer": "### Function Composition\n#### Overview\nFunction composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Here, we'll create a function that takes two functions as input and returns a new function that represents their composition.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef compose(f, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compose two functions together.\n\n    Args:\n        f (function): The outer function.\n        g (function): The inner function.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that represents the composition of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n    def h(x):\n        return f(g(x))\n    return h\n\n# Example usage:\ndef double(x):\n    \"\"\"Double the input.\"\"\"\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    \"\"\"Add one to the input.\"\"\"\n    return x + 1\n\n# Compose the functions\ncomposed = compose(double, add_one)\n\n# Test the composed function\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n*   The `compose` function takes two functions `f` and `g` as input.\n*   It defines a new function `h` that applies `g` to the input `x` and then applies `f` to the result.\n*   The `compose` function returns the new function `h`.\n*   In the example usage, we define two simple functions `double` and `add_one`.\n*   We compose these functions using the `compose` function, resulting in a new function `composed`.\n*   When we apply the `composed` function to the input `5`, it first adds one to get `6` and then doubles the result to get `12`.\n\n#### Advice\n*   Function composition is a powerful technique for building complex functions from simpler ones.\n*   It can help make your code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.\n*   When using function composition, consider the order of the functions and how they will be applied to the input.",
