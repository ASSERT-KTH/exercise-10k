  "answer": "**Recursive Factorial Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The factorial of a number `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Check for negative input\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input number must be non-negative.\")\n    \n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since 0! and 1! are both 1).\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   For `n > 1`, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This is the recursive case.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a number.",
