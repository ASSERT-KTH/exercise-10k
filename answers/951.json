  "prompt": "Write a program that prints powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10 using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10 using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_powers_of_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(11):  # loop from 0 to 10\n        power_of_2 = 2 ** i\n        print(f\"2^{i} = {power_of_2}\")\n\nprint_powers_of_2()\n```\n\nIn this program, we use a for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to 10 (inclusive). For each iteration, we calculate the power of 2 using the exponentiation operator `**`. We then print the result using an f-string, which allows us to insert the values of `i` and `power_of_2` into the string.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10, like this:\n```\n2^0 = 1\n2^1 = 2\n2^2 = 4\n2^3 = 8\n2^4 = 16\n2^5 = 32\n2^6 = 64\n2^7 = 128\n2^8 = 256\n2^9 = 512\n2^10 = 1024\n```",
