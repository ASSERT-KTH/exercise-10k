  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for the cost of a meal and the tip percentage, and then calculates and prints out the total cost of the meal, including the tip.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the tip amount\ndef calculate_tip(cost, tip_percentage):\n    tip_amount = cost * (tip_percentage / 100)\n    return tip_amount\n\n# Define a function to calculate the total cost of a meal\ndef calculate_total_cost(cost, tip_percentage):\n    tip_amount = calculate_tip(cost, tip_percentage)\n    total_cost = cost + tip_amount\n    return total_cost\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Print a welcome message\n    print(\"Welcome to the tip calculator!\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the cost of the meal\n    cost = float(input(\"Enter the cost of the meal: $\"))\n\n    # Ask the user for the tip percentage\n    tip_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage (e.g. 15 for 15%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the total cost of the meal\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(cost, tip_percentage)\n\n    # Print the total cost of the meal\n    print(\"The total cost of the meal is: $%.2f\" % total_cost)\n\n# Call the main function\nmain()\n```\nThis code follows the exact specification provided, including the three functions (`calculate_tip`, `calculate_total_cost`, and `main`) and the input/output interactions with the user. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
