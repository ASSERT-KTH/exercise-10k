  "prompt": "Create a program that simplifies a given fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simplify a fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n    Args:\n        numerator (int): The numerator of the fraction.\n        denominator (int): The denominator of the fraction.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the simplified numerator and denominator.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the denominator is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero error\n    if denominator == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator\n    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\n    # Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor\n    simplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\n    simplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\n    return simplified_numerator, simplified_denominator\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the function\n    numerator = 12\n    denominator = 18\n    simplified_numerator, simplified_denominator = simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator)\n    print(f\"The simplified fraction of {numerator}/{denominator} is {simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `simplify_fraction` function takes two parameters, `numerator` and `denominator`, and returns a tuple containing the simplified numerator and denominator.\n*   It first checks if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero error and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n*   It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator using the `math.gcd` function.\n*   The fraction is simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.\n*   In the `main` function, we test the `simplify_fraction` function with a sample fraction (12/18) and print the simplified fraction.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Simplifying a fraction: `simplify_fraction(12, 18)` returns `(2, 3)`, which is the simplified fraction 2/3.\n*   Handling invalid input: `simplify_fraction(12, 0)` raises a `ValueError` because the denominator cannot be zero.\n*   Simplifying a fraction with a GCD of 1: `simplify_fraction(7, 11)` returns `(7, 11)`, which is the same as the original fraction because the GCD is 1.",
