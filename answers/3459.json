  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the current temperature and weather condition as input, and provides a recommendation for outdoor activities",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that provides recommendations for outdoor activities based on the current temperature and weather condition:\n\n```python\ndef get_recommendation(temperature, weather):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides recommendations for outdoor activities based on temperature and weather.\n\n    Parameters:\n    temperature (float): The current temperature in Celsius.\n    weather (str): The current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A recommendation for an outdoor activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    temperature = float(temperature)\n\n    if weather.lower() == \"rainy\":\n        return \"It's not ideal to go out in the rain. Consider staying indoors or engaging in indoor activities like reading, watching a movie, or playing board games.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"sunny\":\n        if temperature < 15:\n            return \"It's a bit chilly for outdoor activities. Consider wearing warm clothing and engaging in activities like hiking, cycling, or having a picnic.\"\n        elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:\n            return \"Perfect weather! You can engage in outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, playing sports, or going for a walk.\"\n        else:\n            return \"It's hot outside! Be sure to stay hydrated and wear sunscreen. You can engage in outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, or playing sports, but be sure to take breaks in the shade.\"\n    elif weather.lower() == \"cloudy\":\n        if temperature < 10:\n            return \"It's quite chilly and cloudy. Consider wearing warm clothing and engaging in activities like hiking, cycling, or having a picnic.\"\n        elif 10 <= temperature <= 20:\n            return \"It's a great day for outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, or having a picnic. Just be prepared for potential rain showers.\"\n        else:\n            return \"It's warm and cloudy. You can engage in outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, or playing sports, but be sure to stay hydrated and wear sunscreen.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unable to provide a recommendation for the given weather condition. Please try again with a different weather condition.\"\n\ndef main():\n    temperature = input(\"Enter the current temperature in Celsius: \")\n    weather = input(\"Enter the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.): \")\n\n    recommendation = get_recommendation(temperature, weather)\n    print(recommendation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\nTo run the program, save it to a file named `outdoor_activity_recommender.py`, then navigate to the directory containing the file and run it using Python:\n```bash\npython outdoor_activity_recommender.py\n```\nFollow the prompts to enter the current temperature and weather condition, and the program will provide a recommendation for an outdoor activity.\n\n### Example Use Cases\nHere are some example use cases:\n\n*   **Sunny weather with a temperature of 22\u00b0C:**\n    *   Input: `temperature = 22`, `weather = sunny`\n    *   Output: `Perfect weather! You can engage in outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, playing sports, or going for a walk.`\n*   **Rainy weather with a temperature of 18\u00b0C:**\n    *   Input: `temperature = 18`, `weather = rainy`\n    *   Output: `It's not ideal to go out in the rain. Consider staying indoors or engaging in indoor activities like reading, watching a movie, or playing board games.`\n*   **Cloudy weather with a temperature of 12\u00b0C:**\n    *   Input: `temperature = 12`, `weather = cloudy`\n    *   Output: `It's a great day for outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, or having a picnic. Just be prepared for potential rain showers.`",
