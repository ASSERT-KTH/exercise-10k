  "answer": "**List Union Program**\n========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two lists as input and returns their union. The union of two lists is a list containing all unique elements from both lists.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef list_union(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the union of two lists.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The union of list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1) | set(list2))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    print(\"List 1:\", list1)\n    print(\"List 2:\", list2)\n    print(\"Union:\", list_union(list1, list2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `list_union` function takes two lists as input and returns their union.\n2. The `set` function is used to convert the input lists to sets, which automatically removes duplicates.\n3. The `|` operator is used to compute the union of the two sets.\n4. The `list` function is used to convert the resulting set back to a list.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `list_union` function with two example lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nList 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nList 2: [3, 4, 5, 6]\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the union list may not be the same as the order in the original lists, since sets are unordered data structures. If you need to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension to filter out duplicates:\n```python\ndef list_union_ordered(list1, list2):\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in list1 + list2 if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n```\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists, and preserves the original order of elements.",
