  "prompt": "Create a program that takes an email address as input, checks if it's valid, and prints out a success message if it is.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses regular expressions to validate an email address:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an email address.\n\n    Args:\n        email (str): The email address to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Regular expression for validating an email\n    regex = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n    if re.match(regex, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the email address from the user\n    email = input(\"Enter your email address: \")\n\n    # Validate the email address\n    if validate_email(email):\n        print(\"Email address is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Email address is not valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `validate_email` function takes an email address as input and checks it against a regular expression.\n2. The regular expression checks for the following:\n   * One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens before the `@` symbol.\n   * The `@` symbol.\n   * One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens after the `@` symbol.\n   * A dot.\n   * The domain extension (it must be at least 2 characters long).\n3. If the email address matches the regular expression, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter their email address.\n5. The `validate_email` function is called with the user's email address, and if it returns `True`, a success message is printed. Otherwise, an error message is printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Valid email address: `example@gmail.com`\n* Invalid email address: `example@gmail` (missing domain extension)\n* Invalid email address: `@gmail.com` (missing local part)\n* Invalid email address: `example@gmail` (missing domain extension)",
