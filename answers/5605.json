  "answer": "Here is a Python program that creates a to-do list and allows the user to add, remove, and view items:\n```\n# Define a class for the to-do list\nclass ToDoList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.tasks = []\n\n    # Method to add a task to the list\n    def add_task(self, task):\n        self.tasks.append(task)\n        print(f\"Task '{task}' added to the list.\")\n\n    # Method to remove a task from the list\n    def remove_task(self, task_number):\n        try:\n            task_number = int(task_number)\n            if task_number <= len(self.tasks):\n                task = self.tasks.pop(task_number - 1)\n                print(f\"Task '{task}' removed from the list.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid task number.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid task number.\")\n\n    # Method to view all tasks in the list\n    def view_tasks(self):\n        if not self.tasks:\n            print(\"No tasks in the list.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Tasks:\")\n            for i, task in enumerate(self.tasks, start=1):\n                print(f\"{i}. {task}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    to_do_list = ToDoList()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Add task\")\n        print(\"2. Remove task\")\n        print(\"3. View tasks\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n\n        option = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if option == \"1\":\n            task = input(\"Enter the task: \")\n            to_do_list.add_task(task)\n        elif option == \"2\":\n            to_do_list.view_tasks()\n            task_number = input(\"Enter the task number to remove: \")\n            to_do_list.remove_task(task_number)\n        elif option == \"3\":\n            to_do_list.view_tasks()\n        elif option == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The program defines a `ToDoList` class with methods to add, remove, and view tasks.\n2. The `add_task` method appends a new task to the list and prints a confirmation message.\n3. The `remove_task` method removes a task from the list based on its task number. It checks if the task number is valid and prints an error message if it's not.\n4. The `view_tasks` method prints all tasks in the list, along with their task numbers.\n5. The `main` function creates an instance of the `ToDoList` class and enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input.\n6. Based on the user's input, the program performs the corresponding action:\n\t* If the user chooses to add a task, it prompts them to enter the task and calls the `add_task` method.\n\t* If the user chooses to remove a task, it displays the current tasks, prompts them to enter the task number to remove, and calls the `remove_task` method.\n\t* If the user chooses to view tasks, it calls the `view_tasks` method.\n\t* If the user chooses to quit, it prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Add a task: Enter `1` as the option, then enter the task (e.g., \"Buy milk\").\n* Remove a task: Enter `2` as the option, then enter the task number to remove (e.g., `1`).\n* View tasks: Enter `3` as the option.\n* Quit: Enter `4` as the option.",
