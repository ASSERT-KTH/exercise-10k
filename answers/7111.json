  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades. Calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that calculates the average grade for each student in the dictionary:\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(student_grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade for each student in the dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        student_grades (dict): A dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with the student names as keys and their average grades as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    average_grades = {}\n    for student, grades in student_grades.items():\n        # Calculate the sum of grades using the built-in sum function\n        total_grades = sum(grades)\n        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of grades\n        average_grade = total_grades / len(grades)\n        # Store the average grade in the new dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\nstudent_grades = {\n    \"Alice\": [90, 85, 95],\n    \"Bob\": [80, 75, 85],\n    \"Charlie\": [95, 90, 92]\n}\naverage_grades = calculate_average_grades(student_grades)\nprint(average_grades)\n```\nThis program defines a function `calculate_average_grades` that takes a dictionary `student_grades` as input. It then iterates over each student in the dictionary, calculates their average grade, and stores it in a new dictionary `average_grades`. Finally, it returns the `average_grades` dictionary.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input dictionary is well-formed, i.e., it contains only student names as keys and lists of grades as values. If the input dictionary may be malformed, you should add error checking code to handle such cases.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a dictionary comprehension to simplify the code:\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(student_grades):\n    return {student: sum(grades) / len(grades) for student, grades in student_grades.items()}\n```\nThis code uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the average grades for each student. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of grades, and the `len` function is used to get the number of grades.",
