  "answer": "### Rotating an Image by 90 Degrees Clockwise\n#### Function Description\n\nThe following function takes a 2D list representing an image and returns the rotated image.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef rotate_image(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n    Args:\n        image (list): A 2D list representing the image.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The rotated image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Transpose the image (swap rows and columns)\n    transposed_image = list(zip(*image))\n    \n    # Reverse each row to achieve the clockwise rotation\n    rotated_image = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_image]\n    \n    return rotated_image\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define an example image\n    image = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n    \n    # Rotate the image\n    rotated_image = rotate_image(image)\n    \n    # Print the original and rotated images\n    print(\"Original Image:\")\n    for row in image:\n        print(row)\n    \n    print(\"\\nRotated Image:\")\n    for row in rotated_image:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `rotate_image` takes a 2D list `image` as input.\n2.  It first transposes the image using the `zip(*image)` expression, which swaps the rows and columns.\n3.  Then, it reverses each row in the transposed image to achieve the clockwise rotation.\n4.  The rotated image is returned as a new 2D list.\n5.  In the example usage, an image is defined, rotated, and both the original and rotated images are printed to demonstrate the function's effect.",
