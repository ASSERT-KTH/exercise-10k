  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them, then prints the results.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nadd = num1 + num2\nsub = num1 - num2\nmul = num1 * num2\ndiv = num1 / num2\n\nprint(\"Addition: \", add)\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", sub)\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", mul)\nprint(\"Division: \", div)\n```\nNote that I've used `float` as the input type to allow for decimal numbers, as you mentioned in the notes. This code will work as expected, but keep in mind that it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the user enters 0 as the second number. To handle this, you could add a check before performing the division:\n```\nif num2 != 0:\n    div = num1 / num2\n    print(\"Division: \", div)\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n```",
