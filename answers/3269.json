  "answer": "**Vowel Counter Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to count the number of vowels in a given string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_vowels(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of vowels in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string to count vowels in.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of vowels in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    count = 0\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    vowel_count = count_vowels(input_string)\n    print(f\"The string '{input_string}' contains {vowel_count} vowels.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_vowels` function takes an input string and initializes a count variable to 0.\n2. It defines a string of vowels (`vowels`) containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels.\n3. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. If a character is found to be a vowel (i.e., it is in the `vowels` string), the count is incremented by 1.\n5. The function returns the total count of vowels.\n6. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a string, and the `count_vowels` function is called with the input string.\n7. The result is printed to the console, displaying the total number of vowels in the input string.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Run the program and enter a string, such as \"Hello World\".\n* The program will output the number of vowels in the string, which in this case would be 3.",
