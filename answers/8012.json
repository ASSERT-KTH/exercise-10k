  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs the requested operations:\n\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and prints the results.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Perform addition\n    addition_result = num1 + num2\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n    # Perform subtraction\n    subtraction_result = num1 - num2\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n    # Perform multiplication\n    multiplication_result = num1 * num2\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n    # Perform division, checking for division by zero\n    if num2 != 0:\n        division_result = num1 / num2\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get input from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform arithmetic operations\n    perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `perform_arithmetic_operations` function takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n*   It checks for division by zero to prevent an error.\n*   The `main` function gets the input from the user and calls `perform_arithmetic_operations` to perform the arithmetic operations.\n*   The results of the operations are printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers. For example, if you enter `10` and `2`, the program will output the results of the arithmetic operations:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 2\nAddition: 10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0\nSubtraction: 10.0 - 2.0 = 8.0\nMultiplication: 10.0 * 2.0 = 20.0\nDivision: 10.0 / 2.0 = 5.0\n```",
