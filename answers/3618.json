  "answer": "### Mutual Recursion Function for GCD Calculation\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses mutual recursion to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. We'll define two functions, `gcd` and `gcd_helper`, where `gcd` is the main function and `gcd_helper` is the helper function that performs the mutual recursion.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using mutual recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return gcd_helper(a, b)\n\ndef gcd_helper(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function for calculating the greatest common divisor using mutual recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd_helper(b, a % b)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The greatest common divisor of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `gcd` function is the main function that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as arguments and calls the `gcd_helper` function to perform the mutual recursion.\n*   The `gcd_helper` function checks if `b` is zero. If it is, the function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor.\n*   If `b` is not zero, the function calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`) as arguments. This process continues until `b` is zero.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\n### Mutual Recursion\n\nWhile the provided code does use recursion, it's not an example of mutual recursion. Mutual recursion involves two or more functions that call each other recursively.\n\nTo implement mutual recursion for calculating the GCD, we can define two functions, `gcd_even` and `gcd_odd`, where `gcd_even` handles the case when both numbers are even, and `gcd_odd` handles the case when one or both numbers are odd. These functions will call each other recursively.\n\nHere's an updated implementation:\n\n```python\ndef gcd_even(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two even numbers using mutual recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    elif a == b:\n        return a\n    elif a > b:\n        return gcd_odd(a - b, b)\n    else:\n        return gcd_odd(a, b - a)\n\ndef gcd_odd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers (one or both odd) using mutual recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    elif a == b:\n        return a\n    elif a > b:\n        return gcd_even((a - b) // 2, b // 2) if (a - b) % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 else gcd_odd((a - b) // 2, b) if (a - b) % 2 == 0 else gcd_odd(a // 2, (b - a) // 2)\n    else:\n        return gcd_even(a // 2, (b - a) // 2) if (b - a) % 2 == 0 and a % 2 == 0 else gcd_odd(a, (b - a) // 2) if (b - a) % 2 == 0 else gcd_odd((b - a) // 2, a // 2)\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using mutual recursion.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:\n        return gcd_even(a, b)\n    else:\n        return gcd_odd(a, b)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n   ",
