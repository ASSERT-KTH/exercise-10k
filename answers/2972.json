  "prompt": "Create a program that plays a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the user. The program should generate a random move for the computer player.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    print(f\"{board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]}\")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    winning_combos = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for combo in winning_combos:\n        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[combo[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move(board):\n    possible_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n    move = random.choice(possible_moves)\n    board[move] = \"O\"\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        computer_move(board)\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. **Game Board**: The game board is represented as a list of 9 spaces, initially all empty.\n2. **User Move**: The user is prompted to enter their move (1-9), and the corresponding space on the board is marked with an \"X\".\n3. **Computer Move**: After the user's move, the computer generates a random move by selecting an empty space on the board and marking it with an \"O\".\n4. **Winning Conditions**: After each move, the program checks if there is a winner by examining all possible winning combinations. If a winner is found, the game ends and the result is printed.\n5. **Tie Conditions**: If all spaces on the board are filled and no winner is found, the game ends in a tie.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `tic_tac_toe.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python tic_tac_toe.py`). Follow the prompts to play the game.",
