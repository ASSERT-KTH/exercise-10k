  "prompt": "Write a program to find the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the remainder of a division operation.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return remainder\n\n# Example usage:\ndividend = 17\ndivisor = 5\nremainder = calculate_remainder(dividend, divisor)\nprint(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_remainder` function takes two arguments: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n*   It checks if the `divisor` is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if it is, because division by zero is undefined.\n*   It calculates the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`) and returns the result.\n*   In the example usage, we call the `calculate_remainder` function with `dividend = 17` and `divisor = 5`, and print the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_remainder` that takes two arguments: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2.  Check if the `divisor` is zero and raise an error if it is.\n3.  Calculate the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4.  Return the remainder.\n5.  Call the function with example values and print the result.\n\n### Advice:\n\n*   Always check for division by zero to avoid runtime errors.\n*   Use the modulus operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of a division operation.\n*   Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the inputs are not integers.",
