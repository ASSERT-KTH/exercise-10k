  "answer": "**Speed Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the speed of an object given the distance traveled and time taken. It uses the formula: speed = distance / time.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_speed(distance, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the speed of an object given the distance traveled and time taken.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): The distance traveled by the object in meters.\n        time (float): The time taken to travel the distance in seconds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The speed of the object in meters per second.\n    \"\"\"\n    if time == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Time cannot be zero.\")\n    speed = distance / time\n    return speed\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in meters: \"))\n    time = float(input(\"Enter the time taken in seconds: \"))\n\n    # Calculate speed\n    try:\n        speed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\n        print(f\"The speed of the object is {speed:.2f} meters per second.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_speed` function takes two arguments: `distance` and `time`.\n2. It checks if the time is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. It calculates the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n4. The `main` function gets user input for distance and time.\n5. It calls the `calculate_speed` function and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nEnter the distance traveled in meters: 100\nEnter the time taken in seconds: 10\nThe speed of the object is 10.00 meters per second.\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the distance and time are given in meters and seconds, respectively.\n* The speed is calculated in meters per second.\n* The program raises a `ValueError` if the time is zero.",
