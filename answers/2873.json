  "answer": "**Function to Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String**\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears only once in the string. If no such character exists, it returns `None`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str or None: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each character in the string\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n\n    # Iterate over the characters in the original order\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character appears only once\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            # Return the first non-repeating character\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nprint(find_first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbc\"))  # Output: c\nprint(find_first_non_repeating_char(\"aabbcc\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. We iterate over the characters in the original order using a for loop.\n3. For each character, we check if its count is 1. If it is, we return the character as it is the first non-repeating character.\n4. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a non-repeating character, we return `None`.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we make two passes over the string: one to count the characters and one to find the first non-repeating character. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we need to store the count of each character in the `Counter` object.",
