  "answer": "**Leap Year Program**\n======================\n\nThis program determines whether a given year is a leap year using conditional statements.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if year % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    elif year % 100 != 0:\n        return True\n    elif year % 400 != 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `is_leap_year` function takes an integer `year` as input.\n2. It checks if the year is divisible by 4. If not, it's not a leap year.\n3. If the year is divisible by 4, it checks if it's not divisible by 100. If so, it's a leap year.\n4. If the year is divisible by 100, it checks if it's not divisible by 400. If so, it's not a leap year.\n5. If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Input: 2020, Output: 2020 is a leap year.\n* Input: 2021, Output: 2021 is not a leap year.\n* Input: 2000, Output: 2000 is a leap year.\n* Input: 1900, Output: 1900 is not a leap year.\n\n**Notes**\n-----\n\n* This program uses the standard rules for determining leap years:\n\t+ The year can be evenly divided by 4;\n\t+ If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;\n\t+ The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.",
