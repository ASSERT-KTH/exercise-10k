  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the tip given the total bill and tip percentage. The program should use the formula tip = bill * percentage to calculate the tip.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(bill, percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip given the total bill and tip percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        bill (float): The total bill amount.\n        percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated tip amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert percentage to decimal\n    decimal_percentage = percentage / 100\n\n    # Calculate the tip using the formula tip = bill * percentage\n    tip = bill * decimal_percentage\n\n    return tip\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the total bill amount from the user\n    bill = float(input(\"Enter the total bill amount: \"))\n\n    # Get the tip percentage from the user\n    percentage = float(input(\"Enter the tip percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the tip\n    tip = calculate_tip(bill, percentage)\n\n    # Print the calculated tip\n    print(f\"The calculated tip is: ${tip:.2f}\")\n\n    # Print the total amount including the tip\n    total_amount = bill + tip\n    print(f\"The total amount including the tip is: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program defines a function `calculate_tip` that takes the total bill and tip percentage as arguments, calculates the tip using the formula `tip = bill * percentage`, and returns the calculated tip amount.\n\nIn the `main` function:\n1. The program prompts the user to enter the total bill amount and tip percentage.\n2. It calculates the tip by calling the `calculate_tip` function with the provided bill and percentage.\n3. It prints the calculated tip amount.\n4. Finally, it calculates and prints the total amount including the tip.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `tip_calculator.py`), then execute it using Python (e.g., `python tip_calculator.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount and tip percentage. The program will display the calculated tip and total amount.",
