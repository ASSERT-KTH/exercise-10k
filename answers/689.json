  "answer": "**Rounding a Number to the Nearest Integer**\n==============================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n```python\ndef round_to_nearest_integer(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    rounded_num = round_to_nearest_integer(num)\n    print(f\"The number {num} rounded to the nearest integer is {rounded_num}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `round_to_nearest_integer` function takes a floating-point number as input.\n2. The built-in `round` function in Python rounds the number to the nearest integer.\n3. The result is returned as an integer.\n4. In the example usage, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then passed to the `round_to_nearest_integer` function.\n5. The rounded number is printed to the console.\n\n**Note:**\n--------\n\n* The `round` function uses the \"banker's rounding\" algorithm, which rounds to the nearest even number in case of a tie (e.g., 3.5 is rounded to 4, and 2.5 is rounded to 2). If you want to use a different rounding algorithm, you may need to implement it manually.",
