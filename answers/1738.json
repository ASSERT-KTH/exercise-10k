  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a subarray.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses Kadane's algorithm to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_sum(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    for num in nums:\n        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n\n    return max_sum\n\n# Test the function\nnums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]\nprint(max_subarray_sum(nums))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, as there are no subarrays to sum.\n\n2. **Initialization**: The function initializes two variables, `max_sum` and `current_sum`, to keep track of the maximum sum and the sum of the current subarray, respectively. `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity to ensure that any sum will be greater than it, and `current_sum` is initialized to 0.\n\n3. **Kadane's Algorithm**: The function then iterates over each number in the input list. For each number, it calculates the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position by choosing the maximum between the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous subarray sum (`current_sum + num`). It then updates `max_sum` if the new `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`.\n\n4. **Return Maximum Sum**: Finally, the function returns `max_sum`, which is the maximum sum of any subarray in the input list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, as it involves a single pass through the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `max_sum` and `current_sum`, regardless of the size of the input list.",
