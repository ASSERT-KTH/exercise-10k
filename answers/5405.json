  "prompt": "Create a function named 'celsius_to_fahrenheit' that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a solution to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a function. This response will guide you through creating a simple yet effective function to achieve this conversion. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n\n    Args:\n        celsius (float): The temperature in Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a number. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(celsius, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a number.\")\n\n    # Now, we apply the formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: (\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = \u00b0F.\n    # We multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5.\n    fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5\n    \n    # Then, we add 32 to the result to get the Fahrenheit temperature.\n    fahrenheit += 32\n    \n    # Finally, we return the calculated Fahrenheit temperature.\n    return fahrenheit\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(celsius_to_fahrenheit(30))  # Output: 86.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` takes one argument `celsius`, which is the temperature in Celsius that needs to be converted. It first checks if the input is a number and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.\n* The conversion formula `(\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = \u00b0F` is applied in two steps: first, the Celsius temperature is multiplied by `9/5`, and then `32` is added to the result to obtain the Fahrenheit temperature.\n* The calculated Fahrenheit temperature is then returned by the function.\n* An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to convert a temperature of `30` degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, resulting in an output of `86.0`.",
