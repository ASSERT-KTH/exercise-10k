  "answer": "**Calculator Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that asks the user for two numbers and an operator, then performs the specified operation.\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for two numbers and an operator, then performs the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for the first number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the operator\n    while True:\n        operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if operator in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid operator. Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /\")\n\n    # Ask the user for the second number\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Cannot divide by zero. Please enter a non-zero number.\")\n            else:\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Perform the operation\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    while True:\n        response = input(\"Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): \")\n        if response.lower() == \"yes\":\n            calculator()\n        elif response.lower() == \"no\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Run the program and enter two numbers and an operator to perform the operation.\n* Enter `yes` when prompted to perform another operation.\n* Enter `no` when prompted to exit the program.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The program uses a `while` loop to ensure that the user enters valid input.\n* The program uses a `try`-`except` block to catch any `ValueError` exceptions that may occur when converting the user's input to a float.\n* The program uses an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement to perform the specified operation based on the user's input.",
