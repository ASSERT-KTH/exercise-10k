  "answer": "### Function with Type Hints\n\nHere's an example of a function with type hints in Python. This function calculates the area of a rectangle.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (int): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (int): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 5\n    width = 3\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, both of which are integers.\n*   The `-> int` syntax indicates that the function returns an integer value, representing the area of the rectangle.\n*   The docstring provides a description of the function, its arguments, and its return value.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to call the `calculate_area` function with a length of 5 and a width of 3, and then print the calculated area.",
