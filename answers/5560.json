  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of digits in a given integer using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    n = abs(n)  # handle negative numbers\n    sum = 0\n    for digit in str(n):\n        sum += int(digit)\n    return sum\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of the digits is:\", sum_of_digits(num))\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- The `sum_of_digits` function takes an integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.\n- The `abs` function is used to handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value.\n- The integer is converted to a string so that we can iterate over its digits.\n- Inside the for loop, each character (digit) is converted back to an integer and added to the sum.\n- Finally, the program asks for user input, calls the `sum_of_digits` function, and prints the result.",
