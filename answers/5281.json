  "prompt": "Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user, where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program should use a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they guess the correct number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the provided specification:\n```\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    guess = None\n    tries = 0\n\n    while guess != number_to_guess:\n        guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 100: \")\n        if not guess.isdigit():\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n        guess = int(guess)\n        tries += 1\n\n        if guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\n    print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {tries} tries.\")\n\nguessing_game()\n```\nThis code meets all the requirements specified in the breakdown. It defines a function `guessing_game()` that plays a guessing game with the user, using a while loop to keep asking for input until the correct number is guessed. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user's input is validated to ensure it's a digit. The game provides feedback on the user's guess, and once the correct number is guessed, it displays a congratulatory message with the number of tries it took.",
