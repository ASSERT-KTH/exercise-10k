  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_index_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        # Check if the index is odd\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(numbers[i])\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(\"Numbers with odd indices:\")\nprint_odd_index_numbers(numbers)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `print_odd_index_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input. We then use a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list. Inside the loop, we check if the current index is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of the index divided by 2 is not 0, then the index is odd, and we print the corresponding number.\n\nWhen you run this program with the test list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, it will print the numbers at odd indices, which are `2, 4, 6, 8, 10`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Python's enumerate function to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\ndef print_odd_index_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints numbers with odd indices from a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n        # Check if the index is odd\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            print(num)\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(\"Numbers with odd indices:\")\nprint_odd_index_numbers(numbers)\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over both the indices and values of the list simultaneously. The rest of the logic remains the same.",
