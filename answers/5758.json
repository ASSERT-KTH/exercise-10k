  "prompt": "Declare variables with reference data types and print their values",
  "answer": "### Reference Data Types in Python\nPython has several reference data types, including lists, dictionaries, sets, and more. Below is an example that demonstrates how to declare variables with these reference data types and print their values.\n\n#### Code\n```python\n# Lists\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"List:\", my_list)\n\n# Dictionaries\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(\"Dictionary:\", my_dict)\n\n# Sets\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nprint(\"Set:\", my_set)\n\n# Tuples\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nprint(\"Tuple:\", my_tuple)\n\n# Frozen Sets\nmy_frozen_set = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})\nprint(\"Frozen Set:\", my_frozen_set)\n```\n\n#### Output\n```\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nDictionary: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\nSet: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nTuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nFrozen Set: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Lists**: Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists.\n2. **Dictionaries**: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.\n3. **Sets**: Sets are unordered collections of unique items.\n4. **Tuples**: Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items that can be of any data type.\n5. **Frozen Sets**: Frozen sets are unordered, immutable collections of unique items.\n\nEach of these data types has its own use cases and advantages. For example, lists are useful when you need to store a collection of items that need to be modified, while tuples are useful when you need to store a collection of items that should not be modified.",
