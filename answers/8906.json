  "answer": "**First Duplicate Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program finds the first duplicate in a given list. A duplicate is an element that appears more than once in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The first duplicate element, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in seen:\n            return element\n        seen.add(element)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    lst = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(lst)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate is: {duplicate}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create an empty set `seen` to store unique elements.\n2. Iterate through the input list.\n3. For each element, check if it's already in the `seen` set.\n4. If it is, return the element as the first duplicate.\n5. If not, add the element to the `seen` set.\n6. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we're doing a single pass through the list. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the `seen` set.",
