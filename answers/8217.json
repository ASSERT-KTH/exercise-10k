  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses if/else statements to determine the day of the week based on the day number.\n\n```python\ndef find_day(day_number):\n    if day_number == 1:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif day_number == 2:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif day_number == 3:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif day_number == 4:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    elif day_number == 5:\n        return \"Friday\"\n    elif day_number == 6:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n    elif day_number == 7:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid day number. Day number should be between 1 and 7.\"\n\ndef main():\n    day_number = int(input(\"Enter the day number (1-7): \"))\n    print(\"The day of the week is:\", find_day(day_number))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `find_day` function takes an integer `day_number` as input and uses if/else statements to determine the corresponding day of the week.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a day number between 1 and 7, calls the `find_day` function with the user's input, and prints the result.\n3. If the user enters a day number outside the range of 1 to 7, the program prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Enter `1` as the day number to get `Monday` as the output.\n* Enter `3` as the day number to get `Wednesday` as the output.\n* Enter `8` as the day number to get `Invalid day number. Day number should be between 1 and 7.` as the output.",
