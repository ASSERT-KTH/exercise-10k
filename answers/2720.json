  "answer": "**Credit Card Number Validator Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program uses the Luhn algorithm to validate a given credit card number.\n\n### Luhn Algorithm\n\nThe Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the digits in the credit card number.\n2. For each of the odd-positioned digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), double the value of the digit.\n3. If the doubled value is greater than 9, subtract 9 from the doubled value.\n4. Add up all the digits, including the doubled values.\n5. If the sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is valid.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the Luhn algorithm:\n```python\ndef validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any non-digit characters from the card number\n    card_number = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, card_number))\n\n    # Check if the card number is empty or has less than 13 digits\n    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 19:\n        return False\n\n    # Reverse the order of the digits in the card number\n    reversed_card_number = card_number[::-1]\n\n    # Initialize the sum of the digits\n    digit_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the digits in the reversed card number\n    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed_card_number):\n        # Convert the digit to an integer\n        digit = int(digit)\n\n        # If the digit is at an odd position, double its value\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            digit *= 2\n            # If the doubled value is greater than 9, subtract 9\n            if digit > 9:\n                digit -= 9\n\n        # Add the digit to the sum\n        digit_sum += digit\n\n    # Check if the sum is divisible by 10\n    return digit_sum % 10 == 0\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    card_number = input(\"Enter a credit card number: \")\n    if validate_credit_card_number(card_number):\n        print(\"The credit card number is valid.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The credit card number is not valid.\")\n```\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines a function `validate_credit_card_number` that takes a credit card number as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is valid or not. The function implements the Luhn algorithm to validate the credit card number.\n\nThe program first removes any non-digit characters from the card number and checks if the resulting number has between 13 and 19 digits. If not, it returns False.\n\nThe program then reverses the order of the digits in the card number and initializes a sum of the digits. It iterates over the digits in the reversed card number, doubling the value of each odd-positioned digit and subtracting 9 if the doubled value is greater than 9. The program adds each digit to the sum and checks if the sum is divisible by 10. If it is, the program returns True, indicating that the credit card number is valid. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the program prompts the user to enter a credit card number and prints whether the number is valid or not.",
