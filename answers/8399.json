  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image. The mirror image of a matrix is obtained by reversing the order of columns. For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], the mirror image would be [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]. The function should work with matrices of any size.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image, which is obtained by reversing the order of columns. This function will work with matrices of any size. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_image(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a 2D matrix as input and returns its mirror image.\n    The mirror image of a matrix is obtained by reversing the order of columns.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): A 2D list representing the matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The mirror image of the input matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the mirror image of the matrix\n    mirrored_matrix = []\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the input matrix\n    for row in matrix:\n        # Reverse the order of elements in the current row and append it to the mirrored matrix\n        # The reversed function returns a reversed iterator of the given sequence\n        mirrored_matrix.append(list(reversed(row)))\n\n    # Return the mirrored matrix\n    return mirrored_matrix\n\n# Example usage:\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nprint(mirror_image(matrix))  # Output: [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `mirror_image` takes a 2D list `matrix` as input and initializes an empty list `mirrored_matrix` to store the mirror image.\n* It iterates over each row in the input `matrix`, reverses the order of elements in the current row using the `reversed` function, and appends it to `mirrored_matrix`.\n* The `reversed` function returns a reversed iterator of the given sequence, which is then converted to a list using the `list` function.\n* Finally, the function returns the `mirrored_matrix`, which is the mirror image of the input `matrix`.",
