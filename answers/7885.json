  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints out the numbers from 1 to the input number, with each number on a new line. Use a for loop to achieve this.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications:\n```\n<?php\n$n = 100; // replace with the desired input number\nfor ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {\n    echo $i . \"\\n\";\n}\n?>\n```\nThis code will print the numbers from 1 to `$n` (which is set to 100 in this example), with each number on a new line.",
