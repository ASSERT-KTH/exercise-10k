  "answer": "**JSON File Reader/Writer Function**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses the `json` module to read and write JSON files.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef read_json_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a JSON file and returns the data as a Python object.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the JSON file.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict or list: The data from the JSON file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            return json.load(file)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n        return None\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing JSON: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef write_json_file(file_path, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Writes data to a JSON file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the JSON file.\n        data (dict or list): The data to write to the JSON file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:\n            json.dump(data, file, indent=4)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error writing JSON: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = \"example.json\"\n    data = {\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"age\": 30,\n        \"city\": \"New York\"\n    }\n\n    # Write data to JSON file\n    write_json_file(file_path, data)\n\n    # Read data from JSON file\n    read_data = read_json_file(file_path)\n    print(read_data)\n```\n\n**Function Explanation**\n------------------------\n\nThe code defines two functions: `read_json_file` and `write_json_file`.\n\n*   `read_json_file(file_path)`: Reads a JSON file and returns the data as a Python object. It handles errors such as file not found and JSON decoding errors.\n*   `write_json_file(file_path, data)`: Writes data to a JSON file. It uses the `json.dump` function to serialize the data to JSON format and write it to the file.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the functions to write data to a JSON file and then read it back. The `write_json_file` function is used to write a dictionary to a JSON file, and the `read_json_file` function is used to read the data back from the file. The read data is then printed to the console.",
