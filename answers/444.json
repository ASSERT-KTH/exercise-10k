  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\")\n\n    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    print(f\"\\n{result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer from the list `[\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]`.\n2. The `determine_winner` function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input and determines the winner based on the game's rules.\n3. The `main` function plays the game by:\n\t* Asking the user for their choice and validating the input.\n\t* Generating a random choice for the computer.\n\t* Displaying the user's choice and the computer's choice.\n\t* Determining the winner and displaying the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program and follow the prompts to play a game of rock, paper, scissors. For example:\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\n\nYou chose: rock\nComputer chose: scissors\n\nYou win!\n```",
