  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, addressing your request for a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.\n\n    Args:\n        celsius (float): The temperature in Celsius.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The temperature in Fahrenheit.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is a valid number. We'll use a try-except block for this.\n    try:\n        # Now, we'll apply the formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: (\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = \u00b0F\n        # We'll multiply the Celsius temperature by 9 and divide it by 5 to get the first part of the formula.\n        fahrenheit = (celsius * 9) / 5\n        \n        # Then, we'll add 32 to the result to get the final Fahrenheit temperature.\n        fahrenheit += 32\n        \n        # Finally, we'll return the calculated Fahrenheit temperature.\n        return fahrenheit\n    \n    # If the input is not a valid number, we'll catch the exception and raise a ValueError with a meaningful error message.\n    except TypeError:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(celsius_to_fahrenheit(30))  # Output: 86.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` takes a temperature in Celsius as input and applies the formula `(\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = \u00b0F` to convert it to Fahrenheit. It first multiplies the Celsius temperature by 9 and divides it by 5.\n* The result is then added to 32 to get the final Fahrenheit temperature, which is stored in the `fahrenheit` variable and returned by the function.\n* To ensure the input is a valid number, a try-except block is used. If the input is not a valid number, a `TypeError` is caught and a `ValueError` is raised with a meaningful error message.\n* An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to convert 30 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit using the `print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(30))` statement.",
