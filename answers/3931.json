  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n*   It uses the built-in `sum` function to add up all the numbers in the list and the `len` function to get the count of numbers.\n*   The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count.\n*   In the `main` function, we provide an example usage of the `calculate_average` function with a list of numbers.\n*   The result is printed to the console.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure the input list is not empty to avoid a ZeroDivisionError.\n*   You can add error handling code to handle such cases.\n*   For a more robust solution, consider using the `statistics` module in Python, which provides a `mean` function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.",
