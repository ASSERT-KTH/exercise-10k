The class has methods to add students, add grades for a student, calculate the average grade for a student, and display all student grades.\n\nThe `add_student` method adds a new student to the dictionary with an empty list of grades. The `add_grade` method adds a grade to the list of grades for a specific student. The `calculate_average` method calculates the average grade for a student by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades. The `display_grades` method displays all student grades.\n\nThe `main` function provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the `StudentGrades` class. It allows users to add students, add grades, calculate averages, display grades, and exit the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n1. Add a student:\n\t* Enter choice: 1\n\t* Enter student name: John Doe\n2. Add grades for a student:\n\t* Enter choice: 2\n\t* Enter student name: John Doe\n\t* Enter grade: 85\n3. Calculate average grade for a student:\n\t* Enter choice: 3\n\t* Enter student name: John Doe\n4. Display all student grades:\n\t* Enter choice: 4\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and does not include any error handling or validation for invalid inputs. You may want to add additional features such as data validation, error handling, and data persistence to make the program more robust.",
