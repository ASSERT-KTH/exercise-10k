  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score:\n\n```python\n# Define the questions, options, and answers\nquestions = [\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Madrid\"],\n        \"answer\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Earth\", \"Saturn\", \"Jupiter\", \"Uranus\"],\n        \"answer\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\",\n        \"options\": [\"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Raphael\", \"Caravaggio\"],\n        \"answer\": 0\n    }\n]\n\ndef quiz(questions):\n    score = 0\n    for i, question in enumerate(questions):\n        print(f\"Question {i+1}: {question['question']}\")\n        for j, option in enumerate(question['options']):\n            print(f\"{j+1}. {option}\")\n        answer = int(input(\"Enter the number of your answer: \")) - 1\n        if answer == question['answer']:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {question['options'][question['answer']]}.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Quiz finished. Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nquiz(questions)\n```\n\nThis program defines a list of questions, each with a list of possible answers and the correct answer. It then iterates over each question, prints the question and options, asks the user for their answer, checks if the answer is correct, and updates the score accordingly. Finally, it prints the final score.\n\nHere's how you can run the program:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `quiz.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python quiz.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to answer the questions.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter a valid answer (i.e., a number between 1 and the number of options). If the user enters an invalid answer, the program will crash. You may want to add error handling to make the program more robust.",
