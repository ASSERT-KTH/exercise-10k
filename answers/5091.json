  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the current temperature and weather condition as input and prints out a message describing the weather.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you requested:\n\n```python\ndef describe_weather(temperature, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a message describing the weather based on the given temperature and condition.\n\n    Args:\n        temperature (float): The current temperature in degrees Celsius.\n        condition (str): The current weather condition (e.g. \"sunny\", \"cloudy\", \"rainy\", etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current temperature and weather condition from the user\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    condition = input(\"Enter the current weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.): \")\n\n    # Describe the weather\n    describe_weather(temperature, condition)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program will ask the user for the current temperature and weather condition, and then print out a message describing the weather. The temperature is expected to be in degrees Celsius, and the condition can be any string (e.g. \"sunny\", \"cloudy\", \"rainy\", etc.).\n\nHere's an example of how the program might be used:\n\n```\nEnter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: 25\nEnter the current weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.): sunny\nThe current temperature is 25.0 degrees Celsius and the weather is sunny.\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any further modifications to the program. \n\nIf you want to make the program more advanced, you could add some conditional statements to provide more descriptive messages based on the temperature and weather condition. For example:\n\n```python\ndef describe_weather(temperature, condition):\n    if temperature < 0:\n        print(f\"It's freezing outside! The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n    elif temperature < 10:\n        print(f\"It's cold outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n    elif temperature < 20:\n        print(f\"It's mild outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n    elif temperature < 30:\n        print(f\"It's warm outside. The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"It's hot outside! The current temperature is {temperature} degrees Celsius and the weather is {condition}.\")\n\n    if condition == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Don't forget your sunscreen!\")\n    elif condition == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"You might want to bring an umbrella.\")\n    elif condition == \"cloudy\":\n        print(\"It's a good day to stay indoors.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the current temperature and weather condition from the user\n    temperature = float(input(\"Enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius: \"))\n    condition = input(\"Enter the current weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.): \")\n\n    # Describe the weather\n    describe_weather(temperature, condition)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version of the program will provide more descriptive messages based on the temperature, and will also provide some additional advice based on the weather condition.",
