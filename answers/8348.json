  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a bank transaction system. The program should ask the user for their account type (checking or savings) and the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal). Based on the account type and transaction type, the program should apply the corresponding fees and calculate the new balance. If the user tries to withdraw more money than they have in their account, the program should display an error message.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a bank transaction system:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_type, balance=0):\n        self.account_type = account_type\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposit of ${amount} successful. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Error: Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            if self.account_type == \"checking\":\n                fee = 0.01  # 1% fee for checking accounts\n            elif self.account_type == \"savings\":\n                fee = 0.005  # 0.5% fee for savings accounts\n\n            total_amount = amount + (amount * fee)\n            self.balance -= total_amount\n            print(f\"Withdrawal of ${amount} successful. Fee: ${amount * fee:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the bank transaction system!\")\n    account_type = input(\"Enter your account type (checking or savings): \").lower()\n    while account_type not in [\"checking\", \"savings\"]:\n        account_type = input(\"Invalid account type. Please enter checking or savings: \").lower()\n\n    initial_balance = float(input(\"Enter your initial balance: $\"))\n    account = BankAccount(account_type, initial_balance)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nTransaction options:\")\n        print(\"1.

Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a `BankAccount` class with an `__init__` method that initializes the account type and balance.\n*   The `deposit` method adds the deposit amount to the balance and prints a success message.\n*   The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance. If it does, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it applies the corresponding fee based on the account type and updates the balance.\n*   In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter their account type, initial balance, and transaction options.\n*   We use a loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they choose to exit.\n*   Based on the user's choice, we perform the corresponding action (deposit, withdrawal, check balance, or exit).",
