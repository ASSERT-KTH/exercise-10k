  "answer": "**Password Validator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program checks if a given password meets certain conditions, such as length, presence of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_password(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates a password based on the following conditions:\n    - Length: at least 8 characters\n    - Uppercase letters: at least 1\n    - Numbers: at least 1\n    - Special characters: at least 1\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to validate\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is valid, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    conditions = {\n        \"length\": len(password) >= 8,\n        \"uppercase\": re.search(r\"[A-Z]\", password) is not None,\n        \"numbers\": re.search(r\"[0-9]\", password) is not None,\n        \"special_chars\": re.search(r\"[^A-Za-z0-9]\", password) is not None,\n    }\n\n    for condition, met in conditions.items():\n        if not met:\n            print(f\"Password does not meet the '{condition}' condition.\")\n            return False\n\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    validate_password(password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `validate_password` function takes a password as input and checks if it meets the conditions.\n2. The conditions are defined in a dictionary, where each key is a condition and the value is a boolean indicating whether the condition is met.\n3. The `re.search` function is used to search for patterns in the password, such as uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n4. If any condition is not met, a message is printed indicating which condition is not met, and the function returns `False`.\n5. If all conditions are met, a success message is printed, and the function returns `True`.\n6. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a password and calls the `validate_password` function.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Valid password: `P@ssw0rd` (meets all conditions)\n* Invalid password: `password` (does not meet the \"uppercase\" and \"numbers\" conditions)\n* Invalid password: `P@ssword` (does not meet the \"numbers\" condition)",
