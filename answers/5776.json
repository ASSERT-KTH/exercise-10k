  "answer": "**Student Average Grade Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores. It takes the number of subjects and their respective scores as input, then calculates the average grade.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_subjects = int(input(\"Enter the number of subjects: \"))\n\n    total_score = 0\n    subject_scores = {}\n\n    for i in range(num_subjects):\n        subject = input(f\"Enter subject {i+1} name: \")\n        score = float(input(f\"Enter {subject} score (out of 100): \"))\n\n        # Validate score\n        while score < 0 or score > 100:\n            print(\"Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n            score = float(input(f\"Enter {subject} score (out of 100): \"))\n\n        total_score += score\n        subject_scores[subject] = score\n\n    average_grade = total_score / num_subjects\n\n    print(\"\\nSubject Scores:\")\n    for subject, score in subject_scores.items():\n        print(f\"{subject}: {score:.2f}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nAverage Grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n    # Determine grade based on average score\n    if average_grade >= 90:\n        print(\"Grade: A\")\n    elif average_grade >= 80:\n        print(\"Grade: B\")\n    elif average_grade >= 70:\n        print(\"Grade: C\")\n    elif average_grade >= 60:\n        print(\"Grade: D\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Grade: F\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_average_grade()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of subjects.\n3. Enter each subject's name and score.\n4. The program will calculate and display the average grade and determine the grade based on the average score.\n\n**Note:** This program uses a simple grading system where:\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: below 60\n\nYou can modify the grading system as needed.",
