  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. The function should handle the case where the input is not a number.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function that calculates the square of a given number and handles cases where the input is not a number. This function will provide a robust solution to your problem. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef square_number(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a number as an argument and returns its square.\n    If the input is not a number, it raises a TypeError.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int or float): The number to be squared.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or float: The square of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is not a number\n    # We use isinstance to check if the input is either an integer or a float\n    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n        # If the input is not a number, we raise a TypeError with a descriptive message\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a number\")\n\n    # If the input is a number, we calculate its square using the ** operator\n    # The ** operator in Python is used for exponentiation\n    # In this case, we use ** 2 to calculate the square of the number\n    squared_num = num ** 2\n\n    # Finally, we return the squared number\n    return squared_num\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `square_number` takes a single argument `num` and first checks if it's a number using `isinstance(num, (int, float))`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* If `num` is a number, the function calculates its square using the exponentiation operator `** 2` and stores the result in `squared_num`.\n* The function then returns the squared number `squared_num`.\n* The use of `isinstance` to check the type of `num` ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats as input.",
