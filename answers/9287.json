  "prompt": "Create a program that can compress and decompress strings using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The program should take a string as input, compress it using RLE, and then decompress it back to the original string. The compressed string should be in the format of 'charactercount' (e.g., 'a3' for 'aaa'). The program should handle strings with repeated characters and single characters.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\ndef comp(s):\n    res = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        count = 1\n        while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i] == s[i+1]:\n            i += 1\n            count += 1\n        res.append(s[i])\n        if count > 1:\n            res.append(str(count))\n        i += 1\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decomp(s):\n    res = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        count = ''\n        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():\n            count += s[i]\n            i += 1\n        if count:\n            res.append(s[i-1] * int(count))\n        else:\n            res.append(s[i])\n        i += 1\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    s1 = comp(s)\n    print(\"Compressed string:\", s1)\n    s2 = decomp(s1)\n    print(\"Decompressed string:\", s2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've used the `input()` function to read the input string from the user, as it is the most common way to do so in Python. Also, I've used the `join()` method to concatenate the characters in the `res` list into a single string, as it is a more efficient and Pythonic way to do so.",
