  "answer": "**Word Scrambler Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that scrambles a word and asks the user to unscramble it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to scramble\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"Scramble a word by shuffling its characters.\"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)\n    random.shuffle(word_list)\n    return \"\".join(word_list)\n\ndef main():\n    # Choose a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n\n    print(f\"Unscramble the word: {scrambled_word}\")\n    user_answer = input(\"Enter your answer: \")\n\n    if user_answer.lower() == word:\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer was {word}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program starts with a list of words to scramble.\n2. The `scramble_word` function takes a word, converts it to a list of characters, shuffles the list using `random.shuffle`, and joins the characters back into a string.\n3. In the `main` function, a random word is chosen from the list, scrambled, and printed to the console.\n4. The user is prompted to enter their answer.\n5. The program checks if the user's answer matches the original word (case-insensitive). If it does, the program prints \"Correct!\". Otherwise, it prints the correct answer.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nRun the program, and you will see a scrambled word printed to the console. Try to unscramble the word and enter your answer. The program will let you know if you are correct or not.",
