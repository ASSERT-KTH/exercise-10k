  "prompt": "Create an optimized version of the bubble sort algorithm that includes a flag to track if any swaps were made in a pass. If no swaps were made, the algorithm should terminate early. The input will be a list of integers, and the output should be the sorted list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that implements the optimized bubble sort algorithm based on the specifications:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(nums):\n    swapped = True\n    start = 0\n    end = len(nums) - 1\n\n    while start < end and swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        for i in range(start, end):\n            if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:\n                nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[i + 1], nums[i]\n                swapped = True\n        end -= 1\n\n    return nums\n```\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the specification:\n\n1. It initializes the `swapped` flag to `True`, the `start` variable to 0, and the `end` variable to the length of the input list minus 1.\n2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `start` is less than `end` and `swapped` is `True`.\n3. Inside the loop, it sets `swapped` to `False` and then iterates over the range from `start` to `end` (exclusive).\n4. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is greater than the next one. If so, it swaps them and sets `swapped` to `True`.\n5. After the inner loop completes, it decrements `end` by 1 to reduce the range of elements to be sorted.\n6. Once the while loop exits, it returns the sorted list.\n\nNote that I've followed the specification exactly, including the use of the `swapped` flag to track whether any swaps were made in a pass. This optimization helps to terminate the algorithm early if the list is already sorted.",
