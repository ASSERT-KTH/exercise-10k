  "answer": "**Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference Demonstration**\n=====================================================\n\nIn this example, we'll create a simple Python program to demonstrate the difference between pass by value and pass by reference.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef pass_by_value(x):\n    \"\"\"Pass by value example\"\"\"\n    print(\"Inside pass_by_value function:\")\n    print(\"Initial value:\", x)\n    x = 20  # Changing the value\n    print(\"Updated value:\", x)\n\ndef pass_by_reference(lst):\n    \"\"\"Pass by reference example\"\"\"\n    print(\"Inside pass_by_reference function:\")\n    print(\"Initial list:\", lst)\n    lst.append(20)  # Modifying the list\n    print(\"Updated list:\", lst)\n\ndef main():\n    # Pass by value demonstration\n    x = 10\n    print(\"Outside pass_by_value function:\")\n    print(\"Initial value:\", x)\n    pass_by_value(x)\n    print(\"Final value:\", x)\n\n    # Pass by reference demonstration\n    lst = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(\"\\nOutside pass_by_reference function:\")\n    print(\"Initial list:\", lst)\n    pass_by_reference(lst)\n    print(\"Final list:\", lst)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOutside pass_by_value function:\nInitial value: 10\nInside pass_by_value function:\nInitial value: 10\nUpdated value: 20\nFinal value: 10\n\nOutside pass_by_reference function:\nInitial list: [1, 2, 3]\nInside pass_by_reference function:\nInitial list: [1, 2, 3]\nUpdated list: [1, 2, 3, 20]\nFinal list: [1, 2, 3, 20]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   In the `pass_by_value` function, we pass a variable `x` with a value of 10. Inside the function, we change the value of `x` to 20. However, this change does not affect the original variable `x` outside the function, which remains 10. This demonstrates pass by value, where a copy of the value is passed to the function.\n*   In the `pass_by_reference` function, we pass a list `lst` with values \\[1, 2, 3]. Inside the function, we append a new value 20 to the list. Since lists are mutable objects in Python, the changes made to the list inside the function affect the original list outside the function. This demonstrates pass by reference, where a reference to the original object is passed to the function.\n\n**Note:** Python does not have a traditional pass by reference mechanism. Instead, it uses a mechanism called \"call by object sharing\" or \"call by sharing,\" where a reference to the original object is passed to the function. For immutable objects like integers, this behaves like pass by value, while for mutable objects like lists, it behaves like pass by reference.",
