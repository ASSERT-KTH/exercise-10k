  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n        while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n            next_term = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]\n            fib_sequence.append(next_term)\n        return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage\nnum_terms = 10\nfib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(num_terms)\nprint(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:\")\nprint(fib_sequence)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The `generate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2.  It handles base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0 (returns an empty list), 1 (returns `[0]`), or 2 (returns `[0, 1]`).\n3.  For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two terms `[0, 1]`.\n4.  The function then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` reaches `n`.\n5.  Inside the loop, it calculates the next term by adding the last two terms in the sequence (`fib_sequence[-1]` and `fib_sequence[-2]`) and appends it to `fib_sequence`.\n6.  Once the loop completes, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```\n\nYou can adjust the `num_terms` variable to generate Fibonacci sequences of different lengths.",
