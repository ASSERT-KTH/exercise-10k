  "answer": "### Tic Tac Toe Game Function\n#### Description\nA function to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against the user. The function takes in the user's move and updates the board accordingly.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef print_board(board):\n    \"\"\"Print the Tic Tac Toe board.\"\"\"\n    print(f\" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} \")\n    print(\"---+---+---\")\n    print(f\" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} \")\n\ndef check_win(board):\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != \" \":\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if \" \" not in board:\n        return \"Tie\"\n    return False\n\ndef tic_tac_toe():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Tic Tac Toe.\"\"\"\n    board = [\" \"] * 9\n    while True:\n        print_board(board)\n        move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != \" \":\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = \"X\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n        # AI's turn\n        possible_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == \" \"]\n        move = random.choice(possible_moves)\n        board[move] = \"O\"\n        result = check_win(board)\n        if result:\n            print_board(board)\n            if result == \"Tie\":\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"{result} wins!\")\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tic_tac_toe()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `print_board` function is used to print the current state of the board.\n*   The `check_win` function checks if there is a winner or if the game is a tie.\n*   The `tic_tac_toe` function is the main game loop. It prompts the user for a move, updates the board, checks for a winner, and then makes the AI's move.\n*   The AI's move is chosen randomly from the available moves.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\nTo run the game, simply execute the `tic_tac_toe` function. The game will prompt you for a move, and you can enter a number from 1 to 9 to place your piece on the corresponding space on the board. The game will continue until either you or the AI wins, or until the game is a tie.",
