  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a grade as input and checks if it's passing or failing using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that checks if a grade is passing or failing using conditional statements:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to check the grade\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    # Check if the grade is passing (>= 60)\n    if grade >= 60:\n        print(\"The grade is passing.\")\n    # Check if the grade is failing (< 60)\n    else:\n        print(\"The grade is failing.\")\n\n# Take the grade as input from the user\ngrade = float(input(\"Enter a grade: \"))\n\n# Check the grade\ncheck_grade(grade)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define a function**: We define a function `check_grade` to encapsulate the logic for checking the grade.\n2. **Check the grade**: Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if the grade is passing (>= 60). If it is, we print a message indicating that the grade is passing.\n3. **Check for failing grade**: If the grade is not passing, we print a message indicating that the grade is failing.\n4. **Take user input**: We use the `input` function to take the grade as input from the user and convert it to a `float` value.\n5. **Call the function**: We call the `check_grade` function with the user-input grade as an argument.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Enter a grade of 75: The program will print \"The grade is passing.\"\n* Enter a grade of 50: The program will print \"The grade is failing.\"",
