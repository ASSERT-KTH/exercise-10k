  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user. The user can choose to play again or quit after each game.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Return the computer's random choice\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\"\"\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n    \n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\")\n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main program loop\"\"\"\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        play_game()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n4. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to play again or 'n' to quit.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a simple random choice for the computer's move.\n* The `determine_winner` function uses a simple set of rules to determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\n* The `play_game` function handles user input and displays the game's outcome.\n* The `main` function runs the program's main loop, allowing the user to play multiple games.",
