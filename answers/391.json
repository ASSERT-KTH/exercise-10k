  "answer": "**Cube Surface Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length. The surface area of a cube is calculated using the formula: `6 * side_length^2`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number\")\n\n    surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_surface_area` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the calculated surface area.\n2. The function checks if the side length is a positive number and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n3. The surface area is calculated using the formula `6 * side_length^2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_surface_area` function by prompting the user for the side length and printing the calculated surface area.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the surface area of a cube with a side length of 5 units: `calculate_cube_surface_area(5)`\n* Calculate the surface area of a cube with a side length of 10 units: `calculate_cube_surface_area(10)`",
