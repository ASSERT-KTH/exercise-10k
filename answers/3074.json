  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints out their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n    score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Take the score as input from the user\n    while True:\n        try:\n            score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score (0-100): \"))\n            if 0 <= score <= 100:\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Please enter a score between 0 and 100.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given scale.\n*   The `main` function takes the score as input from the user, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid score between 0 and 100.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a score. After entering a score, it will print the corresponding grade. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the student's score (0-100): 85\nThe student's grade is: B\n```",
