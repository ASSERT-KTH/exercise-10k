  "prompt": "Create a program that manages a bank account. The user can deposit or withdraw money, and the program displays the current balance. If the user tries to withdraw more money than the balance, the program displays an error message.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a new bank account with an optional initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposits money into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraws money from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive value.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds. Withdrawal not allowed.\")\n\n    def display_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Displays the current balance of the account.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Management\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Display balance\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.display_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n*   The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account with methods to deposit, withdraw, and display the balance.\n*   The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the account balance, and the `withdraw` method subtracts the amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n*   The `display_balance` method shows the current account balance.\n*   In the `main` function, a simple text-based menu allows users to interact with their bank account.\n*   Users can deposit money, withdraw money, display their balance, or quit the program.\n\n### Example usage\n\nRun the program and follow the on-screen instructions to manage your bank account. Here's an example interaction:\n\n```\nBank Account Management\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Display balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 1\nEnter the amount to deposit: $100\nDeposited $100.00. Current balance: $100.00\n\nBank Account Management\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Display balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 2\nEnter the amount to withdraw: $50\nWithdrew $50.00. Current balance: $50.00\n\nBank Account Management\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Display balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 3\nCurrent balance: $50.00\n\nBank Account Management\n1. Deposit money\n2. Withdraw money\n3. Display balance\n4. Quit\nEnter your choice: 4\nGoodbye!\n```",
