  "answer": "**Cube Volume Calculation Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula for the volume of a cube is `V = s^3`, where `V` is the volume and `s` is the side length.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_volume(side_length: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of a side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length cannot be negative\")\n    return side_length ** 3\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    side_length = 5.0\n    volume = calculate_cube_volume(side_length)\n    print(f\"The volume of the cube with side length {side_length} is {volume}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `calculate_cube_volume` takes one argument, `side_length`, which is the length of a side of the cube.\n2. It checks if the `side_length` is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is, since a side length cannot be negative.\n3. It calculates the volume of the cube by cubing the `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n4. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5.0.",
