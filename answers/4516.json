  "answer": "**Blackjack Program**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a game of Blackjack between the user and the computer.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary to map card ranks to their values\ncard_values = {\n    '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10,\n    'J': 10, 'Q': 10, 'K': 10, 'A': 11\n}\n\n# Define a function to deal a card\ndef deal_card():\n    \"\"\"Deals a random card from a deck.\"\"\"\n    ranks = list(card_values.keys())\n    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']\n    return {'rank': random.choice(ranks), 'suit': random.choice(suits)}\n\n# Define a function to calculate the total value of a hand\ndef calculate_hand_value(hand):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total value of a hand.\"\"\"\n    total = sum([card_values[card['rank']] for card in hand])\n    # Adjust for Aces\n    for card in hand:\n        if card['rank'] == 'A' and total > 21:\n            total -= 10\n    return total\n\n# Define a function to play the game\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Plays a game of Blackjack.\"\"\"\n    # Initialize the player's and dealer's hands\n    player_hand = [deal_card(), deal_card()]\n    dealer_hand = [deal_card(), deal_card()]\n\n    # Display the initial hands\n    print(\"Your hand:\")\n    for card in player_hand:\n        print(f\"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}\")\n    print(f\"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Dealer's up card:\")\n    print(f\"{dealer_hand[0]['rank']} of {dealer_hand[0]['suit']}\")\n\n    # Player's turn\n    while True:\n        action = input(\"Do you want to hit or stand? \")\n        if action.lower() == 'hit':\n            player_hand.append(deal_card())\n            print(\"Your hand:\")\n            for card in player_hand:\n                print(f\"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}\")\n            print(f\"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}\")\n            if calculate_hand_value(player_hand) > 21:\n                print(\"You busted! Dealer wins.\")\n                return\n        elif action.lower() == 'stand':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'hit' or 'stand'.\")\n\n    # Dealer's turn\n    while calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) < 17:\n        dealer_hand.append(deal_card())\n\n    # Display the final hands\n    print()\n    print(\"Your hand:\")\n    for card in player_hand:\n        print(f\"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}\")\n    print(f\"Total: {calculate_hand_value(player_hand)}\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Dealer's hand:\")\n    for card in dealer_hand:\n        print(f\"{card['rank']} of {card['suit']}\")\n    print(f\"Total: {calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand)}\")\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    if calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) > 21:\n        print(\"Dealer busted! You win.\")\n    elif calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) < calculate_hand_value(player_hand):\n        print(\"Your total is higher. You win.\")\n    elif calculate_hand_value(dealer_hand) > calculate_hand_value(player_hand):\n        print(\"Dealer's total is higher. Dealer wins.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"It's a tie!\")\n\n# Play the game\nplay_game()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will deal the initial hands and display them.\n3. Choose to hit or stand by typing 'hit' or 'stand'.\n4. If you hit, the program will deal another card and display the updated hand.\n5. If you stand, the program will reveal the dealer's hand and determine the winner.\n6. The program will display the final result and the winner.",
