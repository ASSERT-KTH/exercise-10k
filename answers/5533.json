  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on two integers:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform bitwise operations\ndef bitwise_operations(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on two integers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first integer.\n        num2 (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing the results of the bitwise operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform bitwise AND operation\n    and_result = num1 & num2\n\n    # Perform bitwise OR operation\n    or_result = num1 | num2\n\n    # Perform bitwise XOR operation\n    xor_result = num1 ^ num2\n\n    # Return the results as a dictionary\n    return {\n        \"AND\": and_result,\n        \"OR\": or_result,\n        \"XOR\": xor_result\n    }\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 5  # Binary: 101\n    num2 = 3  # Binary: 011\n\n    results = bitwise_operations(num1, num2)\n\n    print(f\"Bitwise AND of {num1} and {num2}: {results['AND']}\")\n    print(f\"Bitwise OR of {num1} and {num2}: {results['OR']}\")\n    print(f\"Bitwise XOR of {num1} and {num2}: {results['XOR']}\")\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `bitwise_operations` function takes two integers as input and performs bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations using the corresponding operators (`&`, `|`, and `^`).\n*   The results are returned as a dictionary for easy access.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the `bitwise_operations` function with two integers (5 and 3) and print the results of the bitwise operations.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nBitwise AND of 5 and 3: 1\nBitwise OR of 5 and 3: 7\nBitwise XOR of 5 and 3: 6\n```\n\n**Advice:**\n\n*   When working with bitwise operations, it's essential to understand the binary representation of the numbers involved.\n*   The bitwise AND operation (`&`) sets a bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.\n*   The bitwise OR operation (`|`) sets a bit to 1 if either of the corresponding bits is 1.\n*   The bitwise XOR operation (`^`) sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.",
