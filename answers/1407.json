  "prompt": "Write a program that counts down from a given time in seconds. If the time is above 60, print the minutes and seconds, otherwise print only the seconds.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that counts down from a given time in seconds:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef countdown(t):\n    while t:\n        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)\n        if mins > 0:\n            print(f\"{mins:02d}:{secs:02d}\", end=\"\\r\")\n        else:\n            print(secs, end=\"\\r\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n        t -= 1\n    print(\"Time's up!\")\n\n# Input time in seconds\nt = int(input(\"Enter the time in seconds: \"))\n\n# Start countdown\ncountdown(t)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **User Input**: The program first asks the user to input the time in seconds.\n2. **Countdown Function**: The `countdown` function takes the input time `t` and starts a while loop that continues until `t` reaches 0.\n3. **Time Formatting**: Inside the loop, the program calculates the minutes and seconds using the `divmod` function, which returns the quotient and remainder of the division of `t` by 60.\n4. **Printing Time**: If the minutes are greater than 0, the program prints the time in the format `mm:ss`. Otherwise, it prints only the seconds. The `\\r` at the end of the print statement returns the cursor to the beginning of the line, so the next iteration of the loop overwrites the current line.\n5. **Sleep and Decrement**: The program then pauses for 1 second using `time.sleep(1)` and decrements `t` by 1.\n6. **Time's Up**: Once `t` reaches 0, the program prints \"Time's up!\" to indicate the end of the countdown.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n* Count down from 120 seconds: Enter `120` when prompted, and the program will print `02:00`, `01:59`, ..., `00:01`, `0`, and finally \"Time's up!\".\n* Count down from 30 seconds: Enter `30` when prompted, and the program will print `30`, `29`, ..., `1`, and finally \"Time's up!\".",
