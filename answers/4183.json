  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Function**\n=====================================\n\nHere's a Python function that plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_rock_paper_scissors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        # Get user's choice\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or 'q' to quit: \").lower()\n\n        # Check if user wants to quit\n        if user_choice == 'q':\n            break\n\n        # Validate user's choice\n        if user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Get computer's choice\n        choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Print choices\n        print(f\"\\nUser chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n\n        # Determine winner\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == 'rock':\n            if computer_choice == 'scissors':\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! User wins!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! Computer wins.\")\n        elif user_choice == 'paper':\n            if computer_choice == 'rock':\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! User wins!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! Computer wins.\")\n        elif user_choice == 'scissors':\n            if computer_choice == 'paper':\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! User wins!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! Computer wins.\")\n\n        # Ask user to play again\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (y/n): \").lower()\n        if play_again != 'y':\n            break\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_rock_paper_scissors()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their choice until they choose to quit. The user's choice is validated to ensure it is one of 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. The computer's choice is randomly selected from the same options.\n\nThe function then determines the winner based on the game's rules and prints the result. Finally, the user is asked if they want to play again, and the loop continues if they answer 'y'.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the function and enter 'rock' when prompted to play a game.\n* Enter 'q' to quit the game.\n* Enter an invalid choice to see the validation error message.\n* Play multiple rounds by answering 'y' when asked to play again.",
