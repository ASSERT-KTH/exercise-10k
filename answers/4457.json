  "prompt": "Create a program that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score. The user should be able to input their answers and the program should then print out the final score.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n```python\n# Question and Answer Program\n\n# Dictionary containing questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Paris\",\n        \"B\": \"London\",\n        \"C\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Which programming language is used for this program?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Java\",\n        \"B\": \"Python\",\n        \"C\": \"C++\",\n        \"D\": \"JavaScript\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef ask_questions(questions):\n    \"\"\"Asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of the score.\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Enter the letter of your answer: \").upper()\n        if answer == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer was {options['answer']}: {options[options['answer']]}\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the program.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Question and Answer Program!\")\n    score = ask_questions(questions)\n    print(f\"Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n### How the Program Works\n\n1.  The program defines a dictionary called `questions` that contains questions, options, and answers.\n2.  The `ask_questions` function asks the user each question, provides the options, and checks the user's answer.\n3.  The `main` function runs the `ask_questions` function and prints out the final score.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you a series of questions. You can enter the letter of your answer, and the program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not. At the end, it will print out your final score.",
