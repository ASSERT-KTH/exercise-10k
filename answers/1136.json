  "answer": "**Student Grade Average Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average grade of a student based on their individual grades.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade from a list of grades.\n\n    Args:\n        grades (list): A list of grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of grades from the user\n    num_grades = int(input(\"Enter the number of grades: \"))\n\n    # Get each grade from the user\n    grades = []\n    for i in range(num_grades):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(f\"Enter grade {i+1}: \"))\n                if 0 <= grade <= 100:\n                    grades.append(grade)\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Grade must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    # Calculate and display the average grade\n    average_grade = calculate_average_grade(grades)\n    print(f\"Average grade: {average_grade:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the number of grades when prompted.\n3. Enter each grade when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and display the average grade.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The program uses a `calculate_average_grade` function to calculate the average grade from a list of grades.\n* The `main` function gets the number of grades and each individual grade from the user, then calls `calculate_average_grade` to calculate the average grade.\n* The program checks to ensure that each grade is a number between 0 and 100.\n* The average grade is displayed with two decimal places of precision.",
