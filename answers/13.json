  "answer": "**Exception Handling Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates how to catch and handle exceptions that occur during execution. It includes examples of try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and error handling.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Define a custom exception class\nclass CustomException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"A custom exception class.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef divide_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The dividend.\n        num2 (float): The divisor.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The quotient.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is zero.\n        TypeError: If the inputs are not numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Check if inputs are numbers\n        if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):\n            raise TypeError(\"Inputs must be numbers\")\n\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n\n        # Perform division\n        result = num1 / num2\n        return result\n\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except TypeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Test the divide_numbers function\n    print(divide_numbers(10, 2))  # Expected output: 5.0\n    print(divide_numbers(10, 0))  # Expected output: Error: Cannot divide by zero\n    print(divide_numbers(\"a\", 2))  # Expected output: Error: Inputs must be numbers\n\n    # Test custom exception\n    try:\n        raise CustomException(\"A custom exception occurred\")\n    except CustomException as e:\n        print(f\"Custom exception: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The program defines a custom exception class `CustomException` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.\n2.  The `divide_numbers` function takes two numbers as input and attempts to divide them. It includes try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during execution.\n3.  The function checks if the inputs are numbers and raises a `TypeError` if they are not.\n4.  It also checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero.\n5.  The `main` function tests the `divide_numbers` function with different inputs and demonstrates how to catch and handle exceptions.\n6.  Additionally, the program tests the custom exception by raising it and catching it in a try-except block.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during file operations, such as reading or writing to a file that does not exist.\n*   Implement custom exceptions to provide more informative error messages and handle specific error scenarios in your application.\n*   Use exception handling to handle network errors, such as connection timeouts or invalid responses from a server.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\n*   Always use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during execution.\n*   Provide informative error messages to help diagnose and fix issues.\n*   Use custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios and provide more context.\n*   Keep exception handling code organized and separate from the main logic of your program.",
