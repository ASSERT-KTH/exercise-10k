  "answer": "**Factorial Function**\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is: {result}\")\n```\n**How it works:**\n\n* The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial.\n* It checks if the input number is negative, and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n* It handles the base cases where the input number is 0 or 1, returning 1 in both cases.\n* For numbers greater than 1, it calls itself with the input number decremented by 1, and multiplies the result by the original input number.\n\n**Note:** This function uses recursion, which can be less efficient than an iterative approach for large input numbers. For large inputs, consider using an iterative approach or a library function like `math.factorial` in Python.",
