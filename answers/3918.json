  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom statistics import mean, median, multimode\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list is empty\")\n\n    mean_value = mean(numbers)\n    median_value = median(numbers)\n    mode_value = multimode(numbers)\n\n    return {\n        \"mean\": mean_value,\n        \"median\": median_value,\n        \"mode\": mode_value\n    }\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]\n    stats = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Mean:\", stats[\"mean\"])\n    print(\"Median:\", stats[\"median\"])\n    print(\"Mode:\", stats[\"mode\"])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean, median, and mode.\n2. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary containing the calculated statistics.\n3. The `mean` function calculates the arithmetic mean of the numbers.\n4. The `median` function calculates the median (middle value) of the numbers.\n5. The `multimode` function calculates the mode (most frequently occurring value) of the numbers.\n6. In the `main` function, an example list of numbers is provided, and the `calculate_statistics` function is called to calculate the statistics.\n7. The calculated statistics are then printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating statistics for a dataset of exam scores\n* Analyzing the distribution of values in a dataset\n* Identifying the most frequently occurring value in a dataset\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle edge cases, such as an empty input list.\n* Consider using a more robust method for calculating the mode, such as using a frequency distribution, if the input list contains duplicate values.\n* This program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the input list may contain other data types, additional error handling may be necessary.",
