  "answer": "**Array Difference Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program calculates the difference between two arrays. The difference is defined as the elements that are present in one array but not in the other.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef array_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The difference between the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) ^ set(arr2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    print(\"Array 1:\", arr1)\n    print(\"Array 2:\", arr2)\n    print(\"Difference:\", array_difference(arr1, arr2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `array_difference` function takes two arrays as input and returns their difference.\n2. The `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates from the arrays.\n3. The `^` operator is used to calculate the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n4. The result is converted back to a list using the `list` function.\n5. In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated.\n\n**Example Output**\n----------------\n\n```\nArray 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nArray 2: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nDifference: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nNote that the order of the elements in the difference array may not be the same as the original arrays, as sets are unordered data structures.",
