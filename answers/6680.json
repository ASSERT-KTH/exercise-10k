  "answer": "**Calculating Distance between Two Points in 2D Space**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the distance between two points in 2D space using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point (x1, y1).\n        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point (x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    point1 = (1, 2)  # Coordinates of the first point\n    point2 = (4, 6)  # Coordinates of the second point\n    distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)\n    print(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is: {distance:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_distance` function takes two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing the coordinates of the two points in 2D space.\n2. The function uses the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2) to calculate the distance between the two points.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_distance` function with example points.\n4. The distance is calculated and printed to the console, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Running the Code\n\nSave this code in a file (e.g., `distance_calculator.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python distance_calculator.py`). The output will display the distance between the two example points. You can modify the `point1` and `point2` variables in the `main` function to calculate the distance between different points.",
