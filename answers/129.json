  "answer": "**Cube Surface Area Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a cube given its side length. The surface area of a cube is calculated by finding the area of one face and multiplying it by 6.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a cube given its side length.\n\n    Args:\n        side_length (float): The length of one side of the cube.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Side length must be a positive number.\")\n\n    # Calculate the area of one face\n    face_area = side_length ** 2\n\n    # Calculate the surface area of the cube\n    surface_area = 6 * face_area\n\n    return surface_area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the cube: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_cube_surface_area(side_length)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the cube is: {surface_area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_cube_surface_area` function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the surface area.\n2. It first checks if the side length is a positive number. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the area of one face by squaring the side length.\n4. It then calculates the surface area of the cube by multiplying the face area by 6.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_cube_surface_area` function by asking the user for the side length and printing the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nRun the program, enter a side length when prompted, and it will print the surface area of the cube. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the side length of the cube: 5\nThe surface area of the cube is: 150.00 square units.\n```",
