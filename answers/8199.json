  "answer": "Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort using a nested for loop:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n\n    return arr\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test the function\n    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Define the function**: The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the sorted list.\n2.  **Get the length of the array**: The length of the array is stored in the variable `n`.\n3.  **Outer loop**: The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n4.  **Inner loop**: The inner loop iterates from the first element to the `(n - i - 1)`th element. In each iteration, it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n5.  **Swap elements**: If an element is greater than the next one, they are swapped using tuple assignment.\n6.  **Return the sorted array**: After the outer loop completes, the sorted array is returned.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of bubble sort is:\n\n*   **Best-case**: O(n) when the input array is already sorted.\n*   **Average-case**: O(n^2) for random input arrays.\n*   **Worst-case**: O(n^2) when the input array is sorted in reverse order.\n\nNote that bubble sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its high time complexity. For larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are recommended.",
