  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a for loop to print all prime numbers up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef print_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Print all prime numbers up to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for num in range(2, n + 1):\n        is_prime = True\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            print(num)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    print(f\"Prime numbers up to {n}:\")\n    print_primes(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Get the Upper Limit**: The program asks the user to enter a number, which serves as the upper limit.\n2. **Loop Through Numbers**: The `print_primes` function uses a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 2 to the given upper limit (`n`).\n3. **Check for Primality**: For each number, it checks whether it is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n4. **Print Prime Numbers**: If a number is prime, it is printed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will ask you to enter a number. For example, if you enter `20`, it will print all prime numbers up to 20:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 20\nPrime numbers up to 20:\n2\n3\n5\n7\n11\n13\n17\n19\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple and efficient way to find and print prime numbers up to a given number using a for loop.",
