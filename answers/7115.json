  "prompt": "You are given a dictionary where the keys are the names of students and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects. Create a function that calculates the average grade for each student and then finds the student with the highest average grade. If there are multiple students with the same highest average grade, return all of them.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade for each student and finds the student(s) with the highest average grade. This solution will involve iterating over a dictionary of students, calculating average grades, and identifying the student(s) with the highest average.\n\n\u2022 Initialize variables to store the average grades for each student and the highest average grade found.\n\u2022 Iterate over each student in the dictionary, calculating their average grade and updating the highest average grade and corresponding student(s) as needed.\n\u2022 Store the student(s) with the highest average grade for return.\n\u2022 Return the student(s) with the highest average grade.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_highest_average_grade(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in the given dictionary and returns the student(s) with the highest average grade.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the names of students and the values are dictionaries containing their grades for different subjects.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of students with the highest average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grade for each student\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the given dictionary\n    for student, grades in students.items():\n        # For each student, calculate the sum of their grades\n        total_grade = sum(grades.values())\n        \n        # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum of grades by the number of subjects\n        average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n        \n        # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n        average_grades[student] = average_grade\n\n    # If the students dictionary is empty, return an empty list\n    if not average_grades:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the maximum average grade\n    max_average_grade = max(average_grades.values())\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the students with the highest average grade\n    highest_average_students = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each student in the average_grades dictionary\n    for student, average_grade in average_grades.items():\n        # If the student's average grade is equal to the maximum average grade, add them to the highest_average_students list\n        if average_grade == max_average_grade:\n            highest_average_students.append(student)\n\n    # Return the list of students with the highest average grade\n    return highest_average_students\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    'Alice': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 95},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 90, 'English': 85},\n    'Charlie': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 90, 'English': 90}\n}\n\nprint(find_highest_average_grade(students))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n\u2022 The `find_highest_average_grade` function starts by initializing an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the average grade for each student. It then iterates over each student in the input dictionary `students`, calculating the average grade by summing the grades and dividing by the number of subjects.\n\u2022 The average grade for each student is stored in the `average_grades` dictionary, which is used to find the maximum average grade with `max(average_grades.values())`.\n\u2022 The function then iterates over `average_grades` again to find all students with an average grade equal to the maximum average grade, storing these students in the `highest_average_students` list.\n\u2022 Finally, the function returns the `highest_average_students` list, which contains the name(s) of the student(s) with the highest average grade.",
