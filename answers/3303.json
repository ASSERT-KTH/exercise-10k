  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array and a start and end index as input, and returns a new array containing the elements between the start and end indices.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specification:\n```\nfunction sliceArray(animate, start, end) {\n  return animate.slice(start, end);\n}\n\nexport default sliceArray;\n```\nThis code defines a function `sliceArray` that takes three arguments: `animate`, `start`, and `end`. The function uses the `slice` method on the `animate` array to extract a new array containing the elements between the `start` and `end` indices. The resulting array is then returned by the function.\n\nThe function is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the program.",
