  "answer": "**Email Validation Function**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses a regular expression to validate an email address.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an email address using a regular expression.\n\n    Args:\n    email (str): The email address to be validated.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the email address is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Regular expression pattern for email validation\n    pattern = r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"\n    \n    # Use the re.match function to check if the email matches the pattern\n    if re.match(pattern, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    email1 = \"example@example.com\"\n    email2 = \"invalid_email\"\n\n    print(f\"Is {email1} valid? {validate_email(email1)}\")\n    print(f\"Is {email2} valid? {validate_email(email2)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `validate_email` function takes an email address as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the email is valid or not.\n*   The regular expression pattern `r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"` is used to match most common email address formats. It breaks down into the following components:\n    *   `^` matches the start of the string.\n    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens. This is for the local part of the email (before the `@`).\n    *   `@` matches the `@` symbol.\n    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens. This is for the domain name.\n    *   `\\.` matches a dot (escaped with a backslash because `.` has a special meaning in regex).\n    *   `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches the domain extension (it must be at least 2 characters long).\n    *   `$` matches the end of the string.\n*   The `re.match` function attempts to match the email address against the pattern. If a match is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   This regular expression pattern does not cover all possible valid email formats according to the official specification (RFC 5322). However, it should work for most common email addresses.\n*   For more complex email validation, consider using a dedicated library or service that can handle internationalized domain names, quoted local parts, and other edge cases.",
