  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique character in the string and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that implements the required functionality:\n\n```python\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary where each key is a unique character in the string \n    and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in frequency:\n            frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[char] = 1\n    return frequency\n\ndef main():\n    string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    print(char_frequency(string))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis Python code defines a function named `char_frequency` that calculates the frequency of each character in a given string. It iterates over the string, counting the occurrences of each character, and returns the counts as a dictionary. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `char_frequency` with user input.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask for a string input. After entering a string, it will print a dictionary where each key is a character from the string and the corresponding value is the number of times that character appears in the string.",
