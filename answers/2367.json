  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that calculates the square root or cube root of a given number:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_root():\n    print(\"Root Calculator\")\n    print(\"1. Square Root\")\n    print(\"2. Cube Root\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2): \")\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n        if num < 0:\n            print(\"Error: Square root of negative number is not a real number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The square root of\", num, \"is\", math.sqrt(num))\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n        print(\"The cube root of\", num, \"is\", round(num ** (1. / 3), 3))\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter 1 or 2.\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculate_root()\n    again = input(\"Do you want to calculate again? (yes/no): \")\n    if again.lower() == \"yes\":\n        main()\n    else:\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The program first imports the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function for calculating square roots.\n*   The `calculate_root` function displays a menu for the user to choose between calculating the square root or cube root of a number.\n*   Based on the user's choice, it prompts for a number and calculates the corresponding root.\n*   For square roots, it checks if the number is negative and displays an error message if so, since square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers.\n*   For cube roots, it uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) with a fractional exponent (`1. / 3`) to calculate the cube root.\n*   The `main` function calls `calculate_root` and asks the user if they want to calculate again. If the user responds with \"yes,\" it calls itself recursively; otherwise, it prints a goodbye message and ends the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1.  **Square Root Calculation**:\n\n    *   Run the program and choose option 1 (Square Root).\n    *   Enter a positive number, such as 16.\n    *   The program will display the square root of the number, which is 4.0.\n2.  **Cube Root Calculation**:\n\n    *   Run the program and choose option 2 (Cube Root).\n    *   Enter a number, such as 27.\n    *   The program will display the cube root of the number, which is 3.0.\n3.  **Negative Number for Square Root**:\n\n    *   Run the program and choose option 1 (Square Root).\n    *   Enter a negative number, such as -16.\n    *   The program will display an error message indicating that the square root of a negative number is not a real number.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This program uses a simple text-based interface. For a more complex application, consider using a GUI framework like Tkinter or PyQt.\n*   The program uses the `math` module for square root calculation. For cube roots, it uses exponentiation, which is a more general approach that can be used for calculating roots of any order.\n*   Error handling is essential in programs that interact with users. This program checks for invalid choices and handles the case where a user tries to calculate the square root of a negative number.",
