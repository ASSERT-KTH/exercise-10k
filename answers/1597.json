  "answer": "**Multiple Choice Quiz Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program creates a multiple-choice quiz with a list of questions and their corresponding answers. The user can take the quiz and see their score at the end.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store questions, options, and answers\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef take_quiz(questions):\n    \"\"\"Take the quiz and return the score\"\"\"\n    score = 0\n    for question, options in questions.items():\n        print(question)\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        answer = input(\"Choose your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        if answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer is {options['answer']}\\n\")\n    return score\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the quiz\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the quiz!\")\n    score = take_quiz(questions)\n    print(f\"Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by choosing one of the options (A, B, C, D).\n3. See your score at the end of the quiz.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `questions` to store the questions, options, and answers.\n2. The `take_quiz` function iterates through each question, prints the options, and asks the user for their answer.\n3. If the user's answer matches the correct answer, they score a point.\n4. The `main` function runs the quiz and prints the final score.\n\n### Tips and Variations\n\n* Add more questions to the `questions` dictionary.\n* Use a different data structure, such as a list of dictionaries, to store the questions.\n* Implement a timer to limit the time for each question.\n* Add a feature to save the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.",
