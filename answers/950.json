  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    i = 1\n    total = 0\n    while i <= n:\n        total += i\n        i += 1\n    return total\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter the value of n: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of the first\", n, \"natural numbers is:\", sum_of_natural_numbers(n))\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n- We define a function `sum_of_natural_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n- We initialize two variables: `i` to keep track of the current number and `total` to store the sum.\n- We use a while loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, adding each number to `total`.\n- We ask the user to input the value of `n`.\n- We call the function with the user's input and print the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a number, and then it will print the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there is a more efficient way to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula allows you to calculate the sum directly, without needing a loop. Here is how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter the value of n: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of the first\", n, \"natural numbers is:\", sum_of_natural_numbers(n))\n```\n\nThis version of the program does exactly the same thing as the previous one, but it's more efficient because it doesn't need a loop.",
