  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of the two. This will help you understand how function composition works and how to implement it in Python. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef compose_functions(func1, func2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function \n    that is the composition of the two. The new function will first apply func2 \n    to its input, then apply func1 to the result.\n\n    Args:\n        func1 (function): The first function to be applied in the composition.\n        func2 (function): The second function to be applied in the composition.\n\n    Returns:\n        function: A new function that is the composition of func1 and func2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We want to return a new function, so we define a new function inside our compose_functions function.\n    def composed_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        \n        # First, we apply func2 to the input.\n        # We use *args and **kwargs to allow for any number of arguments and keyword arguments.\n        result_from_func2 = func2(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Then, we apply func1 to the result of func2.\n        # We use *args and **kwargs to allow for any number of arguments and keyword arguments.\n        result_from_func1 = func1(result_from_func2)\n        \n        # Finally, we return the result of the composition.\n        return result_from_func1\n    \n    # We return the new composed function.\n    return composed_function\n\n# Example usage:\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x + 1\n\ndef multiply_by_two(x):\n    return x * 2\n\ncomposed = compose_functions(add_one, multiply_by_two)\nprint(composed(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `compose_functions` function takes two functions `func1` and `func2` as arguments and returns a new function `composed_function`. This new function applies `func2` to its input, then applies `func1` to the result.\n* Inside `composed_function`, we first apply `func2` to the input using `*args` and `**kwargs` to allow for any number of arguments and keyword arguments. The result is stored in `result_from_func2`.\n* Then, we apply `func1` to `result_from_func2` and store the final result in `result_from_func1`.\n* Finally, we return `result_from_func1` as the result of the composition.",
