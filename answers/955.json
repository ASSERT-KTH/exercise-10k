  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that uses a for loop to calculate and print the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the factorial of a given number.\"\"\"\n    factorial = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        factorial *= i\n    return factorial\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        factorial = calculate_factorial(i)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {i} is: {factorial}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a given number `n` using a for loop. Then, in the `main()` function, it uses another for loop to calculate and print the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this approach is not the most efficient way to calculate factorials, especially for larger numbers, because it involves repeated calculations. A more efficient approach would be to use a technique called \"memoization\" to store and reuse previously calculated factorials.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement memoization to calculate factorials:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n, memo = {}):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the factorial of a given number using memoization.\"\"\"\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n == 1 or n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        factorial = n * calculate_factorial(n - 1, memo)\n        memo[n] = factorial\n        return factorial\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Prints the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        factorial = calculate_factorial(i)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {i} is: {factorial}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses a dictionary `memo` to store previously calculated factorials, which avoids repeated calculations and makes the program more efficient.",
