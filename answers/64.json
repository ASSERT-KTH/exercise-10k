  "answer": "**Anagram Check Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first string.\n        str2 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove any whitespace and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if both strings have the same length\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Sort both strings and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(are_anagrams(\"listen\", \"silent\"))  # True\n    print(are_anagrams(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `are_anagrams` takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams.\n2. It first removes any whitespace from the strings and converts them to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3. It then checks if both strings have the same length. If they don't, it immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same number of characters.\n4. Finally, it sorts both strings and compares the sorted lists of characters. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the strings are anagrams.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input strings. However, this is a simple and effective solution for checking anagrams. For larger inputs, a more efficient solution using a hash table or counter could be implemented, with a time complexity of O(n).",
