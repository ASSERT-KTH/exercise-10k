  "prompt": "Given two dictionaries, write a function to merge them into a single dictionary. If a key exists in both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary should be used.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function to merge two dictionaries into one, ensuring that if a key exists in both, the value from the second dictionary is used. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function merges two dictionaries into one. If a key exists in both dictionaries, \n    the value from the second dictionary is used.\n\n    Parameters:\n    dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be merged.\n    dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be merged.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a copy of the first dictionary to avoid modifying it directly\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    \n    # Update the copied dictionary with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary\n    # This will overwrite any duplicate keys with the values from the second dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    \n    # Return the merged dictionary\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nprint(merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `merge_dictionaries` takes two parameters, `dict1` and `dict2`, which are the dictionaries to be merged. It returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n* To avoid modifying the original dictionary, a copy of `dict1` is created using the `copy()` method and stored in `merged_dict`.\n* The `update()` method is then used to update `merged_dict` with the key-value pairs from `dict2`. This overwrites any duplicate keys with the values from `dict2`.\n* Finally, the merged dictionary is returned, providing the combined key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.",
