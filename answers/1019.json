  "answer": "**Character Frequency Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `character_frequency` function takes an input string and initializes an empty dictionary `frequency_dict`.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, it increments the frequency by 1. Otherwise, it adds the character to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. The function returns the dictionary with character frequencies.\n5. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a string.\n6. The `character_frequency` function is called with the input string, and the resulting dictionary is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nInput:\n```\nEnter a string: hello\n```\nOutput:\n```\nCharacter Frequency:\nh: 1\ne: 1\nl: 2\no: 1\n```\nNote: This program is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want to ignore these, you can modify the program to preprocess the input string.",
