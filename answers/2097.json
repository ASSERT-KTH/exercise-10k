  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the mean of a set of numbers\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers, mean):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the variance of a set of numbers\"\"\"\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return variance\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(variance):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the standard deviation of a set of numbers\"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers, mean)\n    standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(variance)\n    \n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Variance:\", variance)\n    print(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program uses the following steps to calculate the standard deviation:\n\n1. **Calculate the mean**: The mean is calculated by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the total count of numbers.\n2. **Calculate the variance**: The variance is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions to calculate the standard deviation of a set of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n* Output:\n\t+ Mean: `3.0`\n\t+ Variance: `2.0`\n\t+ Standard Deviation: `1.4142135623730951`",
