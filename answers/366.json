  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```python\n# Arithmetic Operation Program\n\n# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, op):\n    # Define a dictionary to map operator symbols to their corresponding functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n        '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n        '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n        '/': lambda x, y: x / y\n    }\n\n    # Check if the operator is valid\n    if op in operations:\n        # Perform the operation and return the result\n        return operations[op](num1, num2)\n    else:\n        # Return an error message if the operator is invalid\n        return \"Invalid operator\"\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 5\nop = \"+\"\n\nresult = arithmetic_operation(num1, num2, op)\nprint(f\"{num1} {op} {num2} = {result}\")\n```\nThis code defines a function `arithmetic_operation` that takes three parameters: two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator (`op`). The function uses a dictionary to map operator symbols to their corresponding functions, which are implemented using lambda functions. The function checks if the operator is valid and performs the corresponding operation if it is, returning the result. If the operator is invalid, the function returns an error message. The code also includes an example usage of the function to demonstrate its functionality.",
