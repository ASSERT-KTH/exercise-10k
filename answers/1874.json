  "answer": "**List Zip Program**\n=======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes two lists as input, zips them together into a list of pairs, and prints the resulting list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef zip_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Zip two lists together into a list of pairs.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of pairs, where each pair is a tuple containing one element from each input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(zip(list1, list2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n    list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\n    zipped_list = zip_lists(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Zipped List:\", zipped_list)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `zip_lists` function takes two lists as input and uses the built-in `zip` function to create a list of pairs.\n2. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `zip_lists` with two example lists.\n3. The resulting zipped list is printed to the console.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nZipped List: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\nNote that if the input lists have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter list. If you want to include all elements from both lists, you can use the `zip_longest` function from the `itertools` module instead.",
