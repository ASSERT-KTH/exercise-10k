  "prompt": "Write a program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers input by the user.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations():\n    # Get the first number from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n    # Get the second number from the user\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform addition\n    addition = num1 + num2\n\n    # Perform subtraction\n    subtraction = num1 - num2\n\n    # Perform multiplication\n    multiplication = num1 * num2\n\n    # Perform division (with error handling)\n    if num2 != 0:\n        division = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        division = \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\"\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\n\n# Call the function\nperform_arithmetic_operations()\n```\n\nIn this program, the user is prompted to enter two numbers. The program then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers. The results are printed to the console. Note that the program includes error handling to prevent division by zero. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an error message is printed instead of the result.",
