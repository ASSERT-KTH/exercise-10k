  "answer": "**Trivia Game Program**\n=======================\n\nHere is a simple Python program that asks the user a series of trivia questions and keeps track of the score.\n\n```python\n# Import the required modules\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary with trivia questions, options, and answers\ntrivia_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"Which planet is the largest in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"Answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the famous painting 'The Starry Night'?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n        \"C\": \"Pablo Picasso\",\n        \"D\": \"Claude Monet\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest mammal on Earth?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Blue whale\",\n        \"B\": \"African elephant\",\n        \"C\": \"Hippopotamus\",\n        \"D\": \"Giraffe\",\n        \"Answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"Which music group's original members were John, Paul, George, and Ringo?\": {\n        \"A\": \"The Rolling Stones\",\n        \"B\": \"The Beatles\",\n        \"C\": \"The Who\",\n        \"D\": \"The Beach Boys\",\n        \"Answer\": \"B\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef trivia_game():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Shuffle the questions to randomize the order\n    questions = list(trivia_questions.items())\n    random.shuffle(questions)\n    \n    # Ask each question and check the answer\n    for question, options in questions:\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion: {question}\")\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"Answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        \n        # Get the user's answer\n        answer = input(\"Enter your answer (A, B, C, D): \").upper()\n        \n        # Check if the answer is correct\n        if answer == options[\"Answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct answer!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, the correct answer is {options['Answer']}.\")\n    \n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"\\nGame over! Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    trivia_game()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will ask you a series of trivia questions, one at a time.\n3. Enter your answer for each question (A, B, C, or D).\n4. The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.\n5. After all questions have been asked, the program will print your final score.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program uses a dictionary to store the trivia questions, options, and answers.\n* The questions are shuffled to randomize the order.\n* The user's answers are checked against the correct answers.\n* The final score is printed at the end of the game.",
