  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10, and prints out a message indicating whether the guess is correct or not",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that fulfills your request:\n\n```python\n# Define the number to be guessed\nnumber_to_guess = 7\n\n# Ask the user for their guess\nuser_guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n\n# Check if the guess is correct\nif user_guess == number_to_guess:\n    print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Sorry, your guess is incorrect. The correct number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1. We first define the `number_to_guess` variable and assign it a value.\n2. We then use the `input` function to ask the user for their guess. The `int` function is used to convert the user's input into an integer.\n3. We check if the user's guess is equal to the `number_to_guess` using an `if` statement.\n4. If the guess is correct, we print out a congratulatory message. Otherwise, we print out a message indicating that the guess is incorrect, along with the correct number.\n\nYou can run this program, guess a number, and see the result! \n\nTo make the program more interactive, you could also add a loop to allow the user to guess multiple times until they get it correct. Here's an example of how you could modify the program to do this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number to be guessed\nnumber_to_guess = 7\n\n# Initialize a variable to track the number of attempts\nattempts = 0\n\n# Loop until the user guesses the number correctly\nwhile True:\n    # Ask the user for their guess\n    user_guess = int(input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n\n    # Increment the attempts counter\n    attempts += 1\n\n    # Check if the guess is correct\n    if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n        print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry, your guess is incorrect. Try again!\")\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the program:\n\n1. We add a `while` loop that continues to run until the user guesses the number correctly.\n2. We use a variable `attempts` to track the number of times the user has attempted to guess the number.\n3. We increment the `attempts` counter each time the user makes a guess.\n4. If the user guesses the number correctly, we print out a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took, and then use the `break` statement to exit the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is incorrect, we print out a message encouraging them to try again, and the loop continues.",
