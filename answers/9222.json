  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. You can use basic algorithms such as iterating through the list and comparing each number to find the maximum.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef max_num(list):\n    max_num = list[0]\n    for num in list:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n\nnumbers = [10, 50, 30, 20, 40]\nmax_number = max_num(numbers)\nprint(max_number)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `max_num` that takes a list of numbers as input, iterates through the list to find the maximum number, and returns the maximum number. The code then tests the function with a list of numbers and prints the result. The output will be `50`, which is the maximum number in the list.",
