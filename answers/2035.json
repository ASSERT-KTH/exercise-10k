  "answer": "**Shipping Cost Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the shipping cost based on the package weight and destination. It uses if/else statements to determine the shipping cost.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_shipping_cost(weight, destination):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the shipping cost based on the package weight and destination.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): The weight of the package in pounds.\n        destination (str): The destination of the package (e.g., \"local\", \"regional\", \"national\", \"international\").\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The shipping cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    if destination == \"local\":\n        if weight <= 2:\n            return 3.00\n        elif weight <= 6:\n            return 5.00\n        else:\n            return 7.00\n    elif destination == \"regional\":\n        if weight <= 2:\n            return 5.00\n        elif weight <= 6:\n            return 8.00\n        else:\n            return 12.00\n    elif destination == \"national\":\n        if weight <= 2:\n            return 8.00\n        elif weight <= 6:\n            return 12.00\n        else:\n            return 18.00\n    elif destination == \"international\":\n        if weight <= 2:\n            return 15.00\n        elif weight <= 6:\n            return 25.00\n        else:\n            return 40.00\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid destination\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter the package weight in pounds: \"))\n    destination = input(\"Enter the destination (local, regional, national, international): \")\n    shipping_cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight, destination)\n    print(f\"The shipping cost is: ${shipping_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_shipping_cost` function takes two arguments: `weight` and `destination`.\n2. It uses if/else statements to determine the shipping cost based on the destination and weight.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_shipping_cost` function.\n4. The user is prompted to enter the package weight and destination.\n5. The shipping cost is calculated and printed to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Package weight: 1 pound, Destination: local, Shipping cost: $3.00\n* Package weight: 5 pounds, Destination: regional, Shipping cost: $8.00\n* Package weight: 10 pounds, Destination: national, Shipping cost: $18.00\n* Package weight: 2 pounds, Destination: international, Shipping cost: $15.00",
