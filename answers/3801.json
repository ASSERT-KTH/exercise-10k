  "prompt": "Write a program to print a pattern of asterisks (*) using a for loop. The pattern should have 5 rows and each row should have an increasing number of asterisks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that prints the pattern of asterisks using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of rows in the pattern\nnum_rows = 5\n\n# Loop through each row\nfor i in range(1, num_rows + 1):\n    # Print asterisks for the current row\n    print('*' * i)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the following pattern:\n```\n*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define the number of rows in the pattern (`num_rows = 5`).\n2. We use a for loop to iterate through each row, starting from 1 and ending at `num_rows` (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, we print a string of asterisks using the expression `'*' * i`, where `i` is the current row number. This creates a string with `i` asterisks.\n4. The `print` statement automatically adds a newline character at the end of each row, which creates the vertical pattern.\n\nYou can adjust the `num_rows` variable to change the size of the pattern. For example, setting `num_rows = 10` will print a pattern with 10 rows.",
