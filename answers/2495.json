  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in a List of Numbers**\n\nBelow is a Python program that finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate in a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    - nums (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    - The first duplicate number, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nfirst_duplicate = find_first_duplicate(numbers)\nif first_duplicate is not None:\n    print(f\"The first duplicate is: {first_duplicate}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No duplicates found.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We create a function `find_first_duplicate` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far.\n3. We iterate through the input list. For each number, we check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n4. If a number is already in the `seen` set, it means we have found a duplicate, and we return that number immediately.\n5. If a number is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue with the next number.\n6. If we finish iterating through the entire list without finding any duplicates, we return None.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we are doing a constant amount of work for each number in the list.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\nThe space complexity of this program is also O(n), because in the worst case, we might need to store all numbers in the `seen` set.",
