  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given integer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"The Fibonacci sequence up to {n} numbers is: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n2. It first checks for base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).\n4. It then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` is equal to `n`.\n5. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of the list.\n6. Finally, it returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor `n = 10`, the output will be:\n```\nThe Fibonacci sequence up to 10 numbers is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
