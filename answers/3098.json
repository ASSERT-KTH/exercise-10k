  "answer": "**Symmetric Matrix Check Function**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nA symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its own transpose. This function checks if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the matrix is equal to its transpose\n    return np.allclose(matrix, matrix.T)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a symmetric matrix\n    symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]])\n\n    # Define a non-symmetric matrix\n    non_symmetric_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n\n    print(is_symmetric(symmetric_matrix))  # Output: True\n    print(is_symmetric(non_symmetric_matrix))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `is_symmetric` takes a numpy array `matrix` as input.\n2.  It first checks if the matrix is square by comparing its number of rows and columns.\n3.  If the matrix is not square, it immediately returns `False`.\n4.  If the matrix is square, it checks if the matrix is equal to its transpose using `np.allclose`.\n5.  The `np.allclose` function checks if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.\n6.  If the matrix is equal to its transpose, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   This function assumes that the input matrix is a numpy array. If you're working with a different type of matrix, you may need to modify the function accordingly.\n*   The `np.allclose` function is used instead of `==` to account for floating-point precision issues.\n*   This function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, because it needs to compare each element in the matrix with its corresponding element in the transpose.",
