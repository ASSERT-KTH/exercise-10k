  "answer": "**Program: Quiz Question**\n```python\n# Define a function to ask the question and print the answer\ndef ask_question():\n    # Define the question and answer\n    question = \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\"\n    answer = \"Jupiter\"\n\n    # Ask the user the question\n    print(question)\n    user_response = input(\"Enter your response: \")\n\n    # Print the correct answer\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct answer is: {answer}\")\n\n# Call the function\nask_question()\n```\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask the user \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\" and then print out the correct answer, \"Jupiter\", regardless of the user's response.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The program defines a function `ask_question()` that contains the question and answer.\n2. The function prints the question and asks the user for input.\n3. The function then prints the correct answer.\n\nNote: This program does not check if the user's response is correct or not. If you want to add that functionality, you can modify the program to compare the user's response with the correct answer and print a message indicating whether the response is correct or not. For example:\n```python\n# Define a function to ask the question and print the answer\ndef ask_question():\n    # Define the question and answer\n    question = \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\"\n    answer = \"Jupiter\"\n\n    # Ask the user the question\n    print(question)\n    user_response = input(\"Enter your response: \")\n\n    # Check if the user's response is correct\n    if user_response.lower() == answer.lower():\n        print(\"\\nCorrect!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nSorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is: {answer}\")\n\n# Call the function\nask_question()\n```",
