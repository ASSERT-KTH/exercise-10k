  "prompt": "Create a function that takes in two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries. If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary should override the values from the first dictionary.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that merges two dictionaries, ensuring that the values from the second dictionary override any duplicate keys from the first dictionary. This will provide a clear understanding of how to implement the function. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef combine_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two dictionaries into one. If there are any duplicate keys, \n    the values from the second dictionary override the values from the first dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be combined.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be combined.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we'll create a new dictionary to store the combined key-value pairs.\n    combined_dict = {}\n\n    # We'll start by copying all the key-value pairs from the first dictionary into our new dictionary.\n    # This is because we want to include all the key-value pairs from both dictionaries in our result.\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        # For each key-value pair in the first dictionary, we'll add it to our new dictionary.\n        combined_dict[key] = value\n\n    # Now, we'll copy all the key-value pairs from the second dictionary into our new dictionary.\n    # If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override the values from the first dictionary.\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        # For each key-value pair in the second dictionary, we'll add it to our new dictionary.\n        # If the key already exists in our new dictionary, its value will be updated to the value from the second dictionary.\n        combined_dict[key] = value\n\n    # Finally, we'll return our new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    return combined_dict\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the built-in dictionary update method to simplify the function:\ndef combine_dictionaries_alternative(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two dictionaries into one. If there are any duplicate keys, \n    the values from the second dictionary override the values from the first dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be combined.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be combined.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a copy of the first dictionary to avoid modifying it directly.\n    combined_dict = dict1.copy()\n\n    # Use the update method to add all the key-value pairs from the second dictionary to our new dictionary.\n    # If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override the values from the first dictionary.\n    combined_dict.update(dict2)\n\n    # Return our new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    return combined_dict\n\n# Or even more concise using dictionary unpacking (Python 3.5+):\ndef combine_dictionaries_concise(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function combines two dictionaries into one. If there are any duplicate keys, \n    the values from the second dictionary override the values from the first dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary to be combined.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary to be combined.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use dictionary unpacking to combine the key-value pairs from both dictionaries into a new dictionary.\n    # If there are any duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will override the values from the first dictionary.\n    return {**dict1, **dict2}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `combine_dictionaries` function initializes an empty dictionary `combined_dict` to store the merged key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.\n* It iterates over the key-value pairs in `dict1` and `dict2`, adding them to `combined_dict`. If a key from `dict2` already exists in `combined_dict`, its value is updated to the value from `dict2`.\n* Alternatively, the `combine_dictionaries_alternative` function uses the `update` method to add key-value pairs from `dict2` to a copy of `dict1`, achieving the same result more concisely.\n* The `combine_dictionaries_concise` function uses dictionary unpacking (`{**dict1, **dict2}`) to merge the dictionaries in a single line of code, providing the most concise solution.",
