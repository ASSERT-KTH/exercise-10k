  "answer": "**Variance Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the variance of a given list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_variance(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the variance of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The variance of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return variance\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)\n    print(f\"The variance of the input list is: {variance}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_variance` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean using the `statistics.mean` function.\n2. It then calculates the variance by summing the squared differences between each number and the mean, and dividing by the length of the input list.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_variance` function.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses the population variance formula, which divides by the length of the input list. If you want to calculate the sample variance, you can divide by `len(numbers) - 1` instead.\n* This program assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the input list may contain non-numeric values, you should add error checking code to handle this.",
