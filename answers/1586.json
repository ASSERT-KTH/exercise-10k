Please provide the following words:\")\n\n    # Get user input for different word types\n    noun = get_word(\"Enter a noun: \")\n    verb = get_word(\"Enter a verb: \")\n    adjective = get_word(\"Enter an adjective: \")\n    place = get_word(\"Enter a place: \")\n    person = get_word(\"Enter a person's name: \")\n\n    # Define the story with blanks\n    stories = [\n        f\"One day, {person} was walking through the {adjective} forest when they stumbled upon a {noun}. They decided to {verb} it and take it to the {place}.\",\n        f\"{person} loved to {verb} in the {adjective} {place} with their favorite {noun}.\",\n        f\"In a far-off {place}, there lived a {adjective} {noun} who loved to {verb} with {person}.\"\n    ]\n\n    # Select a random story and print it\n    story = random.choice(stories)\n    print(\"\\nHere's your Mad Libs story:\")\n    print(story)\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    play_again = \"y\"\n    while play_again.lower() == \"y\":\n        play_mad_libs()\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing Mad Libs!\")\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter different types of words. After entering the words, it will generate a random story using those words.\n\n```\nWelcome to Mad Libs! Please provide the following words:\nEnter a noun: book\nEnter a verb: run\nEnter an adjective: happy\nEnter a place: park\nEnter a person's name: John\n\nHere's your Mad Libs story:\nOne day, John was walking through the happy forest when they stumbled upon a book. They decided to run it and take it to the park.\n```\n\nYou can play again by answering \"y\" when prompted. The program will generate a new story with the same words or ask for new words if you want.",
