  "answer": "**Cookbook App Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following program implements a simple cookbook app using a for loop. The app allows users to view recipes, add new recipes, and delete existing recipes.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass Recipe:\n    def __init__(self, name, ingredients, instructions):\n        self.name = name\n        self.ingredients = ingredients\n        self.instructions = instructions\n\nclass Cookbook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.recipes = []\n\n    def add_recipe(self, name, ingredients, instructions):\n        new_recipe = Recipe(name, ingredients, instructions)\n        self.recipes.append(new_recipe)\n\n    def delete_recipe(self, name):\n        for recipe in self.recipes:\n            if recipe.name == name:\n                self.recipes.remove(recipe)\n                print(f\"Recipe '{name}' deleted successfully.\")\n                return\n        print(f\"Recipe '{name}' not found.\")\n\n    def view_recipes(self):\n        if not self.recipes:\n            print(\"No recipes available.\")\n        else:\n            for i, recipe in enumerate(self.recipes, start=1):\n                print(f\"\\nRecipe {i}: {recipe.name}\")\n                print(\"Ingredients:\")\n                for ingredient in recipe.ingredients:\n                    print(f\"- {ingredient}\")\n                print(\"Instructions:\")\n                for instruction in recipe.instructions:\n                    print(f\"- {instruction}\")\n\ndef main():\n    cookbook = Cookbook()\n\n    # Add some sample recipes\n    cookbook.add_recipe(\n        \"Grilled Chicken\",\n        [\"chicken breast\", \"olive oil\", \"salt\", \"pepper\"],\n        [\"Preheat grill to medium-high heat.\", \"Season chicken with salt and pepper.\", \"Grill chicken for 5-6 minutes per side.\"]\n    )\n    cookbook.add_recipe(\n        \"Pasta with Tomato Sauce\",\n        [\"pasta\", \"tomato sauce\", \"parmesan cheese\"],\n        [\"Boil pasta according to package instructions.\", \"Heat tomato sauce in a pan.\", \"Combine pasta and sauce, top with parmesan cheese.\"]\n    )\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nCookbook App Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. View Recipes\")\n        print(\"2. Add Recipe\")\n        print(\"3. Delete Recipe\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        if choice == \"1\":\n            cookbook.view_recipes()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            name = input(\"Enter recipe name: \")\n            num_ingredients = int(input(\"Enter number of ingredients: \"))\n            ingredients = []\n            for i in range(num_ingredients):\n                ingredient = input(f\"Enter ingredient {i+1}: \")\n                ingredients.append(ingredient)\n            num_instructions = int(input(\"Enter number of instructions: \"))\n            instructions = []\n            for i in range(num_instructions):\n                instruction = input(f\"Enter instruction {i+1}: \")\n                instructions.append(instruction)\n            cookbook.add_recipe(name, ingredients, instructions)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            name = input(\"Enter recipe name to delete: \")\n            cookbook.delete_recipe(name)\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* View Recipes: Displays all available recipes.\n\t* Add Recipe: Prompts user to enter recipe details and adds it to the cookbook.\n\t* Delete Recipe: Prompts user to enter recipe name to delete.\n\t* Quit: Exits the program.\n3. Follow the prompts to perform the chosen action.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* View Recipes: Displays the sample recipes added to the cookbook.\n* Add Recipe: Adds a new recipe to the cookbook, such as \"Chicken Tacos\" with ingredients like \"chicken breast\", \"tortillas\", and \"salsa\", and instructions like \"Cook chicken in a pan\", \"Warm tortillas\", and \"Assemble tacos\".\n* Delete Recipe: Deletes a recipe from the cookbook, such as \"Grilled Chicken\".",
