  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and exponent from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base number: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the result\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `power` function calculates the result of the base raised to the power of the exponent using the exponentiation operator (`**`).\n*   The `main` function gets the base and exponent from the user, calculates the result using the `power` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers as input.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter `2` as the base and `3` as the exponent to calculate 2^3, which equals 8.\n*   Enter `2.5` as the base and `2` as the exponent to calculate 2.5^2, which equals 6.25.\n\nTo run the program, simply execute the Python script and follow the prompts to enter the base and exponent. The program will then print the result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.",
