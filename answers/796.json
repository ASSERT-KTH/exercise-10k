  "answer": "**Correlation Coefficient Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the correlation coefficient between two lists of numbers using the Pearson correlation coefficient formula.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_correlation_coefficient(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the correlation coefficient between two lists of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list of numbers.\n        list2 (list): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The correlation coefficient.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert lists to numpy arrays\n    array1 = np.array(list1)\n    array2 = np.array(list2)\n\n    # Calculate the means of the arrays\n    mean1 = np.mean(array1)\n    mean2 = np.mean(array2)\n\n    # Calculate the deviations from the means\n    deviations1 = array1 - mean1\n    deviations2 = array2 - mean2\n\n    # Calculate the covariance and variances\n    covariance = np.sum(deviations1 * deviations2)\n    variance1 = np.sum(deviations1 ** 2)\n    variance2 = np.sum(deviations2 ** 2)\n\n    # Calculate the correlation coefficient\n    correlation_coefficient = covariance / np.sqrt(variance1 * variance2)\n\n    return correlation_coefficient\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n    correlation_coefficient = calculate_correlation_coefficient(list1, list2)\n    print(f\"Correlation coefficient: {correlation_coefficient}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_correlation_coefficient` function takes two lists of numbers as input.\n2. It converts the lists to numpy arrays for efficient calculation.\n3. It calculates the means of the arrays using `np.mean`.\n4. It calculates the deviations from the means by subtracting the means from the arrays.\n5. It calculates the covariance by summing the product of the deviations.\n6. It calculates the variances by summing the squares of the deviations.\n7. It calculates the correlation coefficient using the formula: `covariance / sqrt(variance1 * variance2)`.\n8. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_correlation_coefficient` function with example lists.\n\n**Note**\n-------\n\n* This program assumes that the input lists are of the same length.\n* The correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1, where:\n\t+ 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.\n\t+ -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.\n\t+ 0 indicates no correlation.",
