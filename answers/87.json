  "answer": "**Solution: Finding the First Duplicate Element in a List**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a list of integers, find the first duplicate element.\n\n### Approach\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the elements we have seen so far and their indices. We iterate over the list, and for each element, we check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we return the element as it is the first duplicate. If not, we add it to the dictionary with its index.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate element in a list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate element, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen[num] = True\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nprint(find_first_duplicate(numbers))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `seen` to store the elements we have seen so far.\n2. We iterate over the input list `nums`.\n3. For each element `num`, we check if it is already in the `seen` dictionary.\n4. If `num` is in `seen`, we return it as it is the first duplicate element.\n5. If `num` is not in `seen`, we add it to the dictionary with a value of `True`.\n6. If we finish iterating over the list without finding any duplicates, we return `None`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we make a single pass over the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because in the worst case, we need to store all elements in the `seen` dictionary.",
