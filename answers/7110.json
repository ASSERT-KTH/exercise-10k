  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a nested dictionary with the same keys, but with values that are the results of applying a given function to the original values. The function should handle nested dictionaries of arbitrary depth.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll guide you through creating a function that applies a given function to the values of a dictionary and its nested dictionaries, handling arbitrary depths. This function will return a new dictionary with the same keys but transformed values.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll follow these steps:\n* Create a new dictionary to store the results, ensuring we don't modify the original dictionary.\n* Iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary, checking if the value is a dictionary itself.\n* If a value is a dictionary, recursively apply the transformation function to it, handling nested dictionaries of any depth.\n* If a value is not a dictionary, apply the given function to it directly.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_dict(input_dict, func):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a dictionary and a function as input. It returns a new dictionary \n    with the same keys, but with values that are the results of applying the given function \n    to the original values. The function handles nested dictionaries of arbitrary depth.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be transformed.\n        func (function): The function to be applied to the dictionary values.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the same keys, but with transformed values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a new dictionary to store the results\n    result = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        # If the value is a dictionary, recursively call the function on it\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            # Add the transformed sub-dictionary to the result dictionary\n            result[key] = transform_dict(value, func)\n        else:\n            # If the value is not a dictionary, apply the function to it and add it to the result dictionary\n            result[key] = func(value)\n\n    # Return the resulting dictionary\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n* The `transform_dict` function takes two parameters: `input_dict` (the dictionary to be transformed) and `func` (the function to be applied to the dictionary values).\n* We iterate over each key-value pair in `input_dict` using a `for` loop, checking if the `value` is a dictionary with `isinstance(value, dict)`.\n* If `value` is a dictionary, we recursively call `transform_dict` on it, passing the sub-dictionary and `func` as arguments, and store the result in the `result` dictionary.\n* If `value` is not a dictionary, we apply `func` to it and store the transformed value in the `result` dictionary.",
