  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their corresponding grade based on the following criteria: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications provided:\n```\n# Define the grade boundaries\ngrade_boundaries = {\n    'A': (90, 100),\n    'B': (80, 89),\n    'C': (70, 79),\n    'D': (60, 69),\n    'F': (0, 59)\n}\n\n# Define the main function\ndef get_grade(score):\n    # Check if the score is within the boundaries of each grade\n    for grade, boundaries in grade_boundaries.items():\n        if boundaries[0] <= score <= boundaries[1]:\n            return grade\n\n# Get the student's score from the user\nscore = int(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n# Get the grade based on the score\ngrade = get_grade(score)\n\n# Print the grade\nprint(\"Your grade is:\", grade)\n```\nThis code defines a dictionary `grade_boundaries` that maps each grade to a tuple representing the score boundaries for that grade. The `get_grade` function takes a score as input and iterates over the `grade_boundaries` dictionary to find the grade that corresponds to the score. The user is prompted to enter their score, and the `get_grade` function is called to determine their grade. Finally, the grade is printed to the console.",
