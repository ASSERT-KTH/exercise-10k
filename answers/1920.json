  "answer": "**Weighted Average Calculation**\n=====================================\n\nThe weighted average is a measure of central tendency that takes into account the relative importance or weights of each value in the dataset.\n\n**Formula**\n-----------\n\nThe weighted average formula is:\n\nWA = (\u03a3xi \\* wi) / \u03a3wi\n\nWhere:\n\n* WA = Weighted Average\n* xi = individual values\n* wi = weights corresponding to each value\n* \u03a3 = summation symbol, indicating the sum of all values\n\n**Example Code (Python)**\n------------------------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_weighted_average(values, weights):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the weighted average given a list of numbers and their respective weights.\n\n    Args:\n        values (list): List of numbers\n        weights (list): List of weights corresponding to each value\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Weighted average\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(values) != len(weights):\n        raise ValueError(\"Values and weights must have the same length\")\n\n    weighted_sum = sum(x * w for x, w in zip(values, weights))\n    weight_sum = sum(weights)\n\n    if weight_sum == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Weights cannot sum to zero\")\n\n    return weighted_sum / weight_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nvalues = [10, 20, 30]\nweights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]\nweighted_average = calculate_weighted_average(values, weights)\nprint(\"Weighted Average:\", weighted_average)\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Define the list of values and their corresponding weights.\n2. Check if the lengths of the values and weights lists are equal. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n3. Calculate the weighted sum by multiplying each value with its corresponding weight and summing the results.\n4. Calculate the sum of all weights.\n5. Check if the sum of weights is zero. If so, raise a `ValueError`.\n6. Divide the weighted sum by the sum of weights to get the weighted average.\n7. Return the weighted average.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input lists are valid and do not contain any non-numeric values. You may want to add additional error handling depending on your specific use case.",
