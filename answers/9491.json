The dictionary keys are student names and the values are another dictionary with the subject as the key and the grade as the value.\n\n### Program Code\n\n```python\nclass StudentGrades:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.grades = {}\n\n    def add_student(self, name):\n        \"\"\"Add a student to the grades dictionary\"\"\"\n        if name not in self.grades:\n            self.grades[name] = {}\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' already exists.\")\n\n    def add_grade(self, name, subject, grade):\n        \"\"\"Add a subject and grade for a student\"\"\"\n        if name in self.grades:\n            self.grades[name][subject] = grade\n            print(f\"Grade for '{subject}' added successfully for student '{name}'.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist.\")\n\n    def print_grades(self, name=None):\n        \"\"\"Print out the grades for a specific student or all students\"\"\"\n        if name:\n            if name in self.grades:\n                print(f\"Grades for student '{name}':\")\n                for subject, grade in self.grades[name].items():\n                    print(f\"{subject}: {grade}\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist.\")\n        else:\n            if self.grades:\n                for name, grades in self.grades.items():\n                    print(f\"Grades for student '{name}':\")\n                    for subject, grade in grades.items():\n                        print(f\"{subject}: {grade}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"No students or grades available.\")\n\ndef main():\n    grades = StudentGrades()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nStudent Grades Program\")\n        print(\"1.
