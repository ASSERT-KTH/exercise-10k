  "answer": "**Compliance Function**\n=======================\n\nThe following is an example of a function that uses compliance to ensure its adherence to laws and regulations. This example is written in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\n# Define an enum for compliance status\nclass ComplianceStatus(Enum):\n    COMPLIANT = 1\n    NON_COMPLIANT = 2\n    UNDER_REVIEW = 3\n\n# Define a class for compliance checks\nclass ComplianceCheck:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, laws: List[str]):\n        self.name = name\n        self.description = description\n        self.laws = laws\n\n    def check(self, data: Dict) -> ComplianceStatus:\n        # Implement the compliance check logic here\n        # For example, let's say we're checking if a company's age is above 18\n        if data.get('age') >= 18:\n            return ComplianceStatus.COMPLIANT\n        else:\n            return ComplianceStatus.NON_COMPLIANT\n\n# Define a function that uses compliance checks\ndef ensure_compliance(data: Dict, checks: List[ComplianceCheck]) -> Dict:\n    compliance_results = {}\n    for check in checks:\n        status = check.check(data)\n        compliance_results[check.name] = status\n    return compliance_results\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define some sample data\n    data = {\n        'name': 'John Doe',\n        'age': 25,\n        'address': '123 Main St'\n    }\n\n    # Define some sample compliance checks\n    checks = [\n        ComplianceCheck('Age Check', 'Check if the person is above 18', ['Law 1', 'Law 2']),\n        ComplianceCheck('Name Check', 'Check if the person has a valid name', ['Law 3'])\n    ]\n\n    # Perform the compliance checks\n    results = ensure_compliance(data, checks)\n    print(results)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis example uses a combination of object-oriented programming and enums to create a compliance function. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  **Compliance Status Enum**: We define an enum `ComplianceStatus` to represent the different compliance statuses (COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT, UNDER_REVIEW).\n2.  **Compliance Check Class**: We define a class `ComplianceCheck` to represent individual compliance checks. Each check has a `name`, `description`, and a list of `laws` that it applies to. The `check` method performs the actual compliance check and returns a `ComplianceStatus`.\n3.  **Ensure Compliance Function**: We define a function `ensure_compliance` that takes in some `data` and a list of `ComplianceCheck` objects. It iterates through each check, performs the compliance check, and stores the results in a dictionary.\n4.  **Example Usage**: We provide an example of how to use the `ensure_compliance` function with some sample data and compliance checks.\n\n**Advice**\n----------\n\nTo create a function that uses compliance to ensure its adherence to laws and regulations, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Compliance Requirements**: Determine what laws and regulations your function needs to comply with.\n2.  **Define the Compliance Checks**: Create individual compliance checks that verify adherence to each requirement.\n3.  **Implement the Compliance Checks**: Write the logic for each compliance check, using a combination of programming constructs and data structures as needed.\n4.  **Integrate the Compliance Checks**: Create a function that iterates through each compliance check and performs the necessary checks.\n5.  **Test the Compliance Function**: Thoroughly test the compliance function with sample data to ensure it produces the expected results.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a function that effectively uses compliance to ensure its adherence to laws and regulations.",
