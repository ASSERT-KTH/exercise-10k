  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to simulate a simple banking system, allowing users to deposit and withdraw money.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a banking system in Python:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n        else:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount(1000)  # Initialize the account with a balance of $1000\n    print(\"Welcome to the banking system!\")\n    print(f\"Your initial balance is: ${account.balance}\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit money\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw money\")\n        print(\"3. Check balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to deposit: $\"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: $\"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(f\"Your current balance is: ${account.balance}\")\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Code Works\n1. **Initialization**: The program starts by initializing a `BankAccount` object with an initial balance of $1000.\n2. **Main Loop**: The program then enters a `while` loop, which continues to run until the user chooses to exit.\n3. **User Input**: Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to choose an option:\n   * Deposit money\n   * Withdraw money\n   * Check balance\n   * Exit\n4. **Option Handling**: Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding action:\n   * Deposit: Asks for the amount to deposit and updates the account balance.\n   * Withdraw: Asks for the amount to withdraw and updates the account balance if sufficient funds are available.\n   * Check balance: Displays the current account balance.\n   * Exit: Breaks out of the loop and ends the program.\n5. **Error Handling**: If the user enters an invalid option, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to choose again.",
