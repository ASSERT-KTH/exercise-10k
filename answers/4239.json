  "answer": "**Circle Area Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the area of a circle given its radius.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a circle.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n    try:\n        area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_circle_area` function takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the calculated area.\n2. The area is calculated using the formula `\u03c0 * r^2`, where `r` is the radius.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_circle_area` function.\n4. The program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle, calculates the area, and prints the result.\n5. Error handling is implemented to ensure that the radius is not negative.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the radius of the circle when prompted.\n3. The program will calculate and display the area of the circle.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math` library for the value of \u03c0. The area is calculated with a precision of 2 decimal places.",
