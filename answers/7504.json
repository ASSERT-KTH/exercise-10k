(yes/no): \")\n    if next_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n      break\n\n  else:\n    print(\"Invalid Input\")\n```\n### Explanation\n* The program defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two arguments and returns the result of the corresponding operation.\n* The `divide` function checks for division by zero and returns an error message if the second number is zero.\n* The main program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they choose to quit.\n* The user is presented with a menu to choose the type of calculation they want to perform.\n* Based on the user's choice, the program prompts them to enter two numbers and then calls the corresponding function to perform the calculation.\n* The result of the calculation is printed to the console.\n* After each calculation, the user is asked if they want to perform another calculation. If they respond with anything other than \"yes\", the program exits the loop and ends.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n* Run the program and choose option 1 (addition). Enter two numbers, such as 2 and 3. The program will print the result: `2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0`.\n* Run the program and choose option 4 (division). Enter two numbers, such as 6 and 2. The program will print the result: `6.0 / 2.0 = 3.0`.\n* Run the program and choose option 4 (division). Enter two numbers, such as 6 and 0. The program will print an error message: `6.0 / 0.0 = Error: Division by zero is not allowed`.",
