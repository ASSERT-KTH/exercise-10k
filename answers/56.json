  "answer": "**Minimum Deletions to Sort an Array**\n======================================\n\nThe problem of finding the minimum number of deletions needed to make an array sorted can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nThe idea is to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the array. The minimum number of deletions needed to make the array sorted is equal to the difference between the length of the array and the length of the LIS.\n\n### Code\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_deletions_to_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the minimum number of deletions needed to make an array sorted.\n\n    Args:\n    arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of deletions needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the length of LIS ending at each position\n    lis = [1] * n\n\n    # Compute the length of LIS ending at each position\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lis[i] < lis[j] + 1:\n                lis[i] = lis[j] + 1\n\n    # The minimum number of deletions is the difference between the length of the array and the length of the LIS\n    return n - max(lis)\n\n\n# Example usage\narr = [4, 5, 2, 10, 3]\nprint(\"Minimum deletions:\", min_deletions_to_sort(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize a list `lis` to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at each position.\n2.  Iterate through the array, and for each element, compare it with all previous elements.\n3.  If the current element is greater than a previous element and the length of the LIS ending at the current position is less than the length of the LIS ending at the previous position plus one, update the length of the LIS ending at the current position.\n4.  Finally, return the difference between the length of the array and the maximum length of the LIS.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array.",
