  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Solution**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven an array of strings, find the longest common prefix among all the strings.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution that iterates through the characters of the strings and checks for commonality:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other in strs:\n            if other[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n\n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"a\"]))  # Output: \"a\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Check if the input list `strs` is empty. If it is, return an empty string.\n2. Find the shortest string in the list `strs`. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n3. Iterate through the characters of the shortest string.\n4. For each character, check if it is the same in all other strings at the same position. If it is not, return the prefix up to the current position.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return the entire shortest string as the longest common prefix.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings in the input list. This is because in the worst case, we need to iterate through each character of the shortest string and compare it with each string in the list.",
