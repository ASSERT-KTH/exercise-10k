  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the original price and discount percentage as input and outputs the discounted price.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that calculates the discounted price based on the original price and discount percentage:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discounted price based on the original price and discount percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        original_price (float): The original price of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discounted price.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * original_price\n    \n    # Calculate the discounted price\n    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount\n    \n    return discounted_price\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the original price and discount percentage from the user\n    original_price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: \"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the discounted price\n    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage)\n\n    # Print the discounted price\n    print(f\"The discounted price is: ${discounted_price:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Save the above code in a file named `discount_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program using the command `python discount_calculator.py`.\n4. Enter the original price and discount percentage when prompted.\n5. The program will output the discounted price.\n\n### Example Use Case\nIf the original price is $100 and the discount percentage is 20%, the program will output:\n```\nThe discounted price is: $80.00\n```",
