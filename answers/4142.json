  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function to access a value from a dictionary by its key, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef access_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function accesses a value from a dictionary by its key.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access.\n        key (any): The key of the value to be accessed.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the given key if it exists in the dictionary. Otherwise, it raises a KeyError.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the key exists in the dictionary to avoid a KeyError\n    if key in dictionary:\n        \n        # If the key exists, we can directly access the value using the dictionary's indexing syntax\n        return dictionary[key]\n    \n    # If the key does not exist, we raise a KeyError with a custom message\n    else:\n        raise KeyError(f\"The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(access_dict_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Outputs: John\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `access_dict_value` takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `key`. It first checks if the `key` exists in the `dictionary` to avoid a KeyError.\n* If the `key` exists, it uses the dictionary's indexing syntax (`dictionary[key]`) to directly access the associated value and returns it.\n* If the `key` does not exist, it raises a KeyError with a custom message indicating that the key is not found in the dictionary.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, accessing the value associated with the key `'name'`.",
