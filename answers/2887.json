  "answer": "**Arithmetic Progression Generator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program generates the terms of an arithmetic progression based on user input.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the terms of an arithmetic progression.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (int): The first term of the progression.\n        common_difference (int): The common difference between terms.\n        num_terms (int): The number of terms to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of terms in the arithmetic progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    progression = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(num_terms)]\n    return progression\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    first_term = int(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_difference = int(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    # Generate the arithmetic progression\n    progression = generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, num_terms)\n\n    # Print the progression\n    print(\"Arithmetic Progression:\")\n    print(progression)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first term: `2`\n3. Enter the common difference: `3`\n4. Enter the number of terms: `5`\n5. The program will output the arithmetic progression: `[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]`\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `generate_arithmetic_progression` function takes three arguments: `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `num_terms`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to generate the terms of the arithmetic progression.\n3. The `main` function gets user input for the first term, common difference, and number of terms.\n4. It calls the `generate_arithmetic_progression` function with the user input and prints the resulting progression.",
