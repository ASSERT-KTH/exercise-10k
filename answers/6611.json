  "answer": "**Echo Program**\n===============\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that echoes back every line of text the user types until they type 'quit'.\n\n```python\ndef echo_program():\n    \"\"\"\n    Echoes back every line of text the user types until they type 'quit'.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Type something (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        print(f\"You typed: {user_input}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    echo_program()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The program enters an infinite loop (`while True`).\n2. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to type something using the `input` function.\n3. If the user types 'quit' (case-insensitive), it prints a farewell message and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.\n4. If the user types anything else, it prints back the input using an f-string.\n\n**Example Usage**\n----------------\n\n```\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): Hello, world!\nYou typed: Hello, world!\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): Foo bar baz\nYou typed: Foo bar baz\nType something (or 'quit' to exit): quit\nGoodbye!\n```\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `echo_program.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python echo_program.py`). Then, simply type away, and the program will echo back your input until you type 'quit'.",
