  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, i, sum = 0;\n\n    cout << \"Enter a number: \";\n    cin >> n;\n\n    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (i % 2 == 0) {\n            sum = sum + i;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Sum of even numbers from 1 to \" << n << \" is: \" << sum << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `iostream` library, uses the `using namespace std;` directive, and declares the variables `n`, `i`, and `sum` as specified. It then prompts the user to enter a number, reads the input, and calculates the sum of even numbers using a `for` loop. Finally, it prints the result to the console and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
