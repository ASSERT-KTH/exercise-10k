  "answer": "**BMI Calculator**\n======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.\n\n    Args:\n    - weight (float): Weight in kilograms.\n    - height (float): Height in meters.\n\n    Returns:\n    - bmi (float): The calculated BMI.\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef get_bmi_category(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the BMI category based on the calculated BMI.\n\n    Args:\n    - bmi (float): The calculated BMI.\n\n    Returns:\n    - category (str): The corresponding BMI category.\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        category = \"Underweight\"\n    elif bmi < 25:\n        category = \"Normal weight\"\n    elif bmi < 30:\n        category = \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        category = \"Obese\"\n    return category\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kilograms: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n    # Determine BMI category\n    category = get_bmi_category(bmi)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your BMI category is: {category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your weight and height. After entering the values, it will calculate and print your BMI along with the corresponding category.\n\n```\nEnter your weight in kilograms: 70\nEnter your height in meters: 1.75\nYour BMI is: 22.86\nYour BMI category is: Normal weight\n```",
