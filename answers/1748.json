  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and mode of an array of integers.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport statistics\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_statistics(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = statistics.mean(arr)\n\n    # Calculate the median\n    median = statistics.median(arr)\n\n    # Calculate the mode\n    counter = Counter(arr)\n    mode = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    return mean, median, mode\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n    mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(arr)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    print(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the mean, median, and mode.\n2. The `statistics.mean` function is used to calculate the mean.\n3. The `statistics.median` function is used to calculate the median.\n4. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to calculate the mode. The `most_common` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a value and its frequency. The mode is the value with the highest frequency.\n5. In the `main` function, an example array is created and the `calculate_statistics` function is called to calculate the mean, median, and mode.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the input array is not empty.\n* If there are multiple modes (i.e., multiple values with the same highest frequency), this program will return one of them arbitrarily.\n* The `statistics` module is part of the Python standard library, so you don't need to install any additional packages to use this program.",
