  "prompt": "Create a function called 'calculate_grade' that takes in a student's score as a percentage and returns a letter grade based on the following scale: A (90-100%), B (80-89%), C (70-79%), D (60-69%), F (below 60%). The function should also handle cases where the input is not a valid percentage.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that converts a student's score into a letter grade, handling both valid and invalid input percentages. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the letter grade based on the given score as a percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score as a percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding letter grade or an error message if the input is not a valid percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input is not a number or is less than 0 or greater than 100\n    if not isinstance(score, (int, float)) or score < 0 or score > 100:\n        # If it's not a valid percentage, we return an error message\n        return \"Error: Invalid percentage. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.\"\n\n    # Now, we start checking the grade based on the given scale\n    # We check if the score is 90 or above for an A grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        # If it's 90 or above, we return 'A'\n        return 'A'\n\n    # If it's not an A, we check if it's 80 or above for a B grade\n    elif score >= 80:\n        # If it's 80 or above, we return 'B'\n        return 'B'\n\n    # If it's not a B, we check if it's 70 or above for a C grade\n    elif score >= 70:\n        # If it's 70 or above, we return 'C'\n        return 'C'\n\n    # If it's not a C, we check if it's 60 or above for a D grade\n    elif score >= 60:\n        # If it's 60 or above, we return 'D'\n        return 'D'\n\n    # If it's none of the above, it must be below 60, so we return 'F'\n    else:\n        # We return 'F' for scores below 60\n        return 'F'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `calculate_grade` function first checks if the input `score` is a valid percentage by ensuring it's a number between 0 and 100. If not, it returns an error message.\n* It then uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the corresponding letter grade based on the given scale, starting from the highest grade (A) down to the lowest (F).\n* For each grade check, it returns the corresponding letter grade as soon as the condition is met, making the function efficient by avoiding unnecessary checks.\n* If the score doesn't meet any of the grade conditions, it defaults to returning 'F', indicating a failing grade.",
