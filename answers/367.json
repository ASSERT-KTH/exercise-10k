  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as input and outputs the result of the operation. The program should handle invalid operations and division by zero.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that satisfies the specifications:\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n\"\"\"\nThis script performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef main():\n    numb1 = input(\"Enter the first number: \")\n    numb2 = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\n    oper = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Check if inputs are valid numbers\n    if not numb1.replace('.', '', 1).replace('-', '', 1).isdigit():\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input for first number\")\n        return\n    if not numb2.replace('.', '', 1).replace('-', '', 1).isdigit():\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input for second number\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert inputs to floats\n    numb1 = float(numb1)\n    numb2 = float(numb2)\n\n    # Perform operation\n    if oper == \"+\":\n        print(\"Result: \", numb1 + numb2)\n    elif oper == \"-\":\n        print(\"Result: \", numb1 - numb2)\n    elif oper == \"*\":\n        print(\"Result: \", numb1 * numb2)\n    elif oper == \"/\":\n        if numb2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Result: \", numb1 / numb2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've carefully followed the specifications to ensure that every detail is included. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
