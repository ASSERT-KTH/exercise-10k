Add a course:\n    *   Choose option 1.\n    *   Enter course name, start time, end time, and days.\n    *   If the course does not conflict with existing courses, it will be added to the schedule.\n2.  Print the schedule:\n    *   Choose option 2.\n    *   The current schedule will be displayed, showing all added courses.\n3.  Check course conflicts:\n    *   Choose option 3.\n    *   Enter the course name, start time, end time, and days.\n    *   The program will check if the course has conflicts with existing courses and display the result.\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThis program uses two classes: `Course` and `Schedule`. The `Course` class represents a university course with attributes for the course name, start time, end time, and days. The `Schedule` class represents a university course schedule and has methods to add courses, check for conflicts, and print the schedule.\n\nThe `check_conflicts` method checks if a course has conflicts with any existing courses in the schedule by comparing their days and times.",
