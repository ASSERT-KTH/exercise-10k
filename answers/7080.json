  "answer": "**Reading Three Numbers and Printing the Maximum**\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that reads three numbers from the user and prints the maximum of the three.\n\n```python\ndef get_max_of_three():\n    # Read three numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    num3 = float(input(\"Enter the third number: \"))\n\n    # Find and print the maximum of the three numbers\n    max_num = max(num1, num2, num3)\n    print(f\"The maximum of the three numbers is: {max_num}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_max_of_three()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `get_max_of_three` function is defined to encapsulate the logic.\n2. The user is prompted to enter three numbers, which are stored in `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.\n3. The built-in `max` function is used to find the maximum of the three numbers.\n4. The maximum number is printed to the console.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure the `get_max_of_three` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n**Note:** This code uses `float` to allow for decimal numbers. If you only want to consider integers, you can replace `float` with `int`.",
