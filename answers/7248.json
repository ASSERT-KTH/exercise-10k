  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of these operations.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that the specifications describe:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 5;\n\n    int c = a + b;\n    int d = a - b;\n    int e = a * b;\n    double f = (double)a / b;\n\n    printf(\"a + b = %d\\n\", c);\n    printf(\"a - b = %d\\n\", d);\n    printf(\"a * b = %d\\n\", e);\n    printf(\"a / b = %.2f\\n\", f);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code performs the specified operations and prints the results to the console. The `printf` statements use format specifiers to insert the values of the variables into the output strings. The `%d` specifier is used for integers, and the `%.2f` specifier is used for the floating-point result of the division operation.",
