  "prompt": "Given a dictionary and a key, write a function to retrieve the value associated with that key. If the key does not exist, return 'Key not found'.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll help you create a function to retrieve a value associated with a given key from a dictionary, handling cases where the key does not exist. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef get_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n    \n    If the key does not exist in the dictionary, returns 'Key not found'.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key (any): The key to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        any: The value associated with the key if found, 'Key not found' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the dictionary is None to avoid an AttributeError\n    if dictionary is None:\n        return 'Dictionary is None'\n\n    # Then, we check if the key exists in the dictionary\n    # We use the 'in' keyword to check for key existence, which is more efficient than trying to access the key and catching the KeyError\n    if key in dictionary:\n        # If the key exists, we return its associated value\n        return dictionary[key]\n    else:\n        # If the key does not exist, we return 'Key not found'\n        return 'Key not found'\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nprint(get_value(my_dict, 'a'))  # Outputs: 1\nprint(get_value(my_dict, 'd'))  # Outputs: Key not found\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_value` takes two parameters: `dictionary` and `key`. It first checks if the `dictionary` is `None` to avoid an `AttributeError`.\n* It then checks if the `key` exists in the `dictionary` using the `in` keyword, which is more efficient than trying to access the key and catching the `KeyError`.\n* If the `key` exists, it returns the associated value using `dictionary[key]`. Otherwise, it returns 'Key not found'.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `get_value` function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, retrieving values for existing and non-existing keys.",
