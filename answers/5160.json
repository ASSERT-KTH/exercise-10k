  "answer": "### Mode Age Calculation\nTo find the mode age of students, we need to calculate the age that appears most frequently in the dictionary.\n\n#### Python Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_mode_age(students):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the mode age of students in a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        students (dict): Dictionary where keys are student names and values are their corresponding ages.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or list: The mode age(s) of students.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract ages from the dictionary\n    ages = list(students.values())\n\n    # Count the frequency of each age\n    age_counts = Counter(ages)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_count = max(age_counts.values())\n\n    # Find all ages with the maximum frequency\n    mode_ages = [age for age, count in age_counts.items() if count == max_count]\n\n    return mode_ages\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents = {\n    \"John\": 20,\n    \"Alice\": 22,\n    \"Bob\": 20,\n    \"Charlie\": 20,\n    \"David\": 22\n}\n\nmode_ages = find_mode_age(students)\nprint(\"Mode age(s):\", mode_ages)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. Extract the ages from the dictionary using `list(students.values())`.\n2. Use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each age.\n3. Find the maximum frequency using `max(age_counts.values())`.\n4. Find all ages with the maximum frequency using a list comprehension.\n5. Return the mode age(s).\n\nNote: If there are multiple modes (i.e., multiple ages with the same maximum frequency), the function returns a list of all mode ages.",
