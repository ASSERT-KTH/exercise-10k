  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n=====================================================\n\nThis program uses a sliding window approach with a set to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_set = set()\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    input_str = \"abcabcbb\"\n    longest = longest_substring(input_str)\n    print(f\"Longest substring without repeating characters: {longest}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.\n2.  Use a set, `char_set`, to store unique characters in the current substring.\n3.  Iterate through the string with the `right` pointer.\n4.  If a repeating character is found, move the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the set.\n5.  Update the maximum length and substring if a longer substring without repeating characters is found.\n6.  Return the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as each character is visited at most twice.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, as in the worst case, the set will store all unique characters in the string.",
