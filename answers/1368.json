  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width must be greater than zero.\")\n    return length * width\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n        print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: The `calculate_rectangle_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which represents the area of the rectangle.\n2.  **Input Validation**: The function checks if the provided length and width are greater than zero. If either is not, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\n3.  **Main Function**: In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to input the length and width of the rectangle.\n4.  **Error Handling**: The program attempts to calculate the area using the provided inputs and catches any `ValueError` that might be raised. If an error occurs, it displays the error message; otherwise, it prints the calculated area.\n\n### Running the Program:\n\n1.  Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `rectangle_area.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.\n3.  Run the program by executing the command `python rectangle_area.py`.\n4.  Follow the prompts to input the length and width of the rectangle.\n5.  The program will display the calculated area or an error message if the inputs are invalid.",
