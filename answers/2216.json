  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        cout << i << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code includes the `iostream` header, uses the `std` namespace, reads an integer `n` from the input, uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, and prints each number in the sequence followed by a newline character. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution.",
