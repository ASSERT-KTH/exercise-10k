  "answer": "**Simple Dictionary Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program creates a simple dictionary that stores words and their meanings. It uses an if/else statement to handle user input and provide the corresponding definitions.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary\ndictionary = {\n    \"hello\": \"a greeting\",\n    \"world\": \"the earth and its inhabitants\",\n    \"python\": \"a programming language\"\n}\n\ndef get_definition(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the definition of a word if it exists in the dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    if word.lower() in dictionary:\n        return dictionary[word.lower()]\n    else:\n        return \"Word not found in dictionary.\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Simple Dictionary Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n    \n    while True:\n        word = input(\"Enter a word (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        \n        if word.lower() == \"quit\":\n            break\n        elif word.lower() in dictionary:\n            print(f\"{word.capitalize()}: {dictionary[word.lower()]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{word.capitalize()}: Word not found in dictionary.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The program defines a dictionary `dictionary` that stores words and their meanings.\n2. The `get_definition` function takes a word as input and returns its definition if it exists in the dictionary. If the word is not found, it returns a \"Word not found in dictionary\" message.\n3. The `main` function provides a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the dictionary.\n4. The user is prompted to enter a word, and the program checks if the word is in the dictionary using an if/else statement.\n5. If the word is found, the program prints the word and its definition.\n6. If the word is not found, the program prints a \"Word not found in dictionary\" message.\n7. The user can exit the program by typing 'quit'.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a word that exists in the dictionary: `hello`\n* Enter a word that does not exist in the dictionary: `foo`\n* Exit the program: `quit`",
