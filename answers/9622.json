  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a name as an argument and prints out a personalized greeting.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that generates a personalized greeting based on the input provided. This function will take a name as an argument and print out a customized message. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'greeting' that takes one argument 'name'.\ndef greeting(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints out a personalized greeting.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name to be used in the greeting.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Inside the function, we want to print out a greeting message that includes the name.\n    # We use an f-string to insert the name into the string.\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# Now we can call the function with a name to see the greeting.\ngreeting(\"John\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `greeting` function is defined with a single argument `name`, which is expected to be a string. This function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, the argument it takes, and what it returns.\n* Inside the `greeting` function, an f-string is used to format the greeting message. The `name` variable is inserted into the string using the `{name}` placeholder, allowing for a personalized message.\n* When the `greeting` function is called with a name, such as `John`, it prints out the greeting message to the console.\n* The `print` function is used to output the greeting message directly to the console, and since the function doesn't return any value, its return type is `None`.",
