  "prompt": "Write a Python program that takes a dictionary as input, where each key is a student's name and each value is another dictionary containing the student's grades for different subjects. The program should calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has no grades, the program should print a message indicating that.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the detailed specification:\n```python\n# Introduction and Problem Statement\n# This program calculates the average grade for each student in a dictionary.\n\n# Input Dictionary\nstudents = {\n    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 90, \"Science\": 85, \"English\": 95},\n    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 70, \"Science\": 75, \"English\": 80},\n    \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 90, \"English\": 95},\n    \"David\": {}  # No grades for David\n}\n\n# Looping Through the Input Dictionary\nfor student, grades in students.items():\n    if not grades:\n        print(f\"{student} has no grades.\")\n    else:\n        average = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n        print(f\"{student}'s average grade is {average}.\")\n```\nThis code defines the `students` dictionary with the specified structure and data, then loops through it using the `.items()` method. For each student, it checks if the `grades` dictionary is empty. If it is, it prints a message indicating that the student has no grades. If the `grades` dictionary is not empty, it calculates the average grade using the `sum()` and `len()` functions, and prints the result.\n\nNote that this code assumes that all grades are numeric values. If the grades can be non-numeric (e.g., letters or strings), additional error handling may be necessary.",
