  "answer": "**Concatenating Two Lists**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that concatenates two lists into a single list.\n\n```python\ndef concatenate_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Concatenates two lists into a single list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to concatenate.\n        list2 (list): The second list to concatenate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The concatenated list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list1 + list2\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\nconcatenated_list = concatenate_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Concatenated List:\", concatenated_list)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a function `concatenate_lists` that takes two lists as arguments.\n*   Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists.\n*   The concatenated list is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we create two lists `list1` and `list2`, and then call the `concatenate_lists` function to concatenate them.\n*   The resulting concatenated list is printed to the console.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nConcatenated List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple way to concatenate two lists in Python. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the lists, and the result is a new list that contains all elements from both original lists.",
