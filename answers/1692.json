  "answer": "**Most Frequent Element Function**\n====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a list as input and returns the most frequent element in the list. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, it returns all of them.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_element(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the most frequent element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the most frequent elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each element\n    freq = Counter(lst)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = max(freq.values())\n\n    # Return all elements with the maximum frequency\n    return [elem for elem, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    print(most_frequent_element(lst))  # Output: [4]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in the list.\n2. The maximum frequency is found using the `max` function.\n3. A list comprehension is used to return all elements with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function returns all elements with the maximum frequency. If you only want to return one element, you can modify the function to return the first element it encounters with the maximum frequency.",
