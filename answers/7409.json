  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A. If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is B. If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is C. If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is D. If the score is below 60, the grade is F.",
  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The grade of the student.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2. The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_grade` function by prompting the user to enter a score and then printing the corresponding grade.\n4. The program uses a `float` to store the score, allowing for decimal scores.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a score of 95: The grade is A\n* Enter a score of 82: The grade is B\n* Enter a score of 75: The grade is C\n* Enter a score of 65: The grade is D\n* Enter a score of 40: The grade is F\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `grade_calculator.py`).\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python grade_calculator.py`).\n3. Follow the prompt to enter a score.\n4. The program will print the corresponding grade.",
