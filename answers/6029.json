  "prompt": "Create a function that uses an anonymous function (lambda) to calculate the square of a number. Use the function to calculate the square of 4.",
  "answer": "### Calculating the Square of a Number using Lambda Function\n#### Code\n\n```python\n# Define a function that uses lambda to calculate the square of a number\ncalculate_square = lambda x: x ** 2\n\n# Use the function to calculate the square of 4\nresult = calculate_square(4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The square of 4 is:\", result)\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `calculate_square` using the `lambda` keyword, which takes an argument `x` and returns its square (`x ** 2`).\n*   The `lambda` function is equivalent to a regular function defined with the `def` keyword, but it's more concise and can be defined inline.\n*   We then use the `calculate_square` function to calculate the square of 4 by passing `4` as an argument.\n*   Finally, we print the result to verify that the function works correctly.\n\n#### Output\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe square of 4 is: 16\n```",
