  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score. The program should take the score as input and output the corresponding grade. The grades are as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use conditional statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the grade of a student based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The score of the student.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the score is within the valid range (0-100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100.\"\n    \n    # Use conditional statements to determine the grade\n    if score >= 90:  # Check for grade A\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:  # Check for grade B\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:  # Check for grade C\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:  # Check for grade D\n        return \"D\"\n    else:  # If the score is below 60, it's an F\n        return \"F\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the score: \"))\n    \n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(f\"The grade is: {grade}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1.  **Function `calculate_grade(score)`**: This function takes the score as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2.  **Input Validation**: The function checks if the score is within the valid range (0-100). If not, it returns an error message.\n3.  **Conditional Statements**: The function uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the score.\n4.  **Main Function**: The `main()` function gets the score from the user, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade(score)` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   Enter a score between 90 and 100 to get grade A.\n*   Enter a score between 80 and 89 to get grade B.\n*   Enter a score between 70 and 79 to get grade C.\n*   Enter a score between 60 and 69 to get grade D.\n*   Enter a score below 60 to get grade F.\n*   Enter a score outside the range 0-100 to get an error message.",
