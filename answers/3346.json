  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and the computer.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:\n```\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the user's choice and validate it.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            return user_choice\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\"\"\"\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = get_user_choice()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"\\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer.\n2. The `get_user_choice` function gets the user's choice and validates it to ensure it's one of the allowed options.\n3. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.\n4. The `play_game` function plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user if they want to play again.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block calls the `play_game` function when the script is run directly.\n\nYou can run this code and play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the computer!",
