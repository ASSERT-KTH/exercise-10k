  "prompt": "Calculate the simple interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.",
  "answer": "**Simple Interest Calculation**\n\nTo calculate the simple interest, you can use the following formula:\n\n**I = P * R * T**\n\nWhere:\n- **I** is the interest\n- **P** is the principal amount\n- **R** is the interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 4% = 0.04)\n- **T** is the time period (in years)\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose you have a principal amount of $1,000, an interest rate of 5%, and a time period of 2 years. To calculate the simple interest:\n\n1. Convert the interest rate to decimal form: 5% = 0.05\n2. Plug in the values into the formula: I = $1,000 * 0.05 * 2\n3. Calculate the interest: I = $100\n\nSo, the simple interest for this example is **$100**.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n```python\ndef calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the simple interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): The principal amount\n        rate (float): The interest rate (in decimal form)\n        time (float): The time period (in years)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The simple interest\n    \"\"\"\n    interest = principal * rate * time\n    return interest\n\n# Example usage\nprincipal = 1000\nrate = 0.05\ntime = 2\n\ninterest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)\nprint(f\"The simple interest is: ${interest:.2f}\")\n```\nThis code defines a function `calculate_simple_interest` that takes in the principal amount, interest rate, and time period as arguments and returns the calculated simple interest. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with the provided values.",
