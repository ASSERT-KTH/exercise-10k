  "prompt": "Write a program to declare a character variable, assign it a value, and then print the ASCII value of the character.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\n# Declare a character variable and assign it a value\nchar = 'A'\n\n# Print the ASCII value of the character\nprint(\"The ASCII value of '\" + char + \"' is\", ord(char))\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe ASCII value of 'A' is 65\n```\n\nThe `ord()` function in Python returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string. For ASCII characters, this is equivalent to the ASCII value.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the program works:\n\n1. `char = 'A'`: This line declares a variable `char` and assigns it the value `'A'`.\n2. `print(\"The ASCII value of '\" + char + \"' is\", ord(char))`: This line prints a message that includes the ASCII value of the character stored in `char`. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value. \n\nThis program can be used with any character. Just replace `'A'` with the character you're interested in.",
