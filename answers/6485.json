  "answer": "**Reading and Printing User Input**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that reads a line of text from the user and prints it back out.\n\n```python\ndef read_and_print_user_input():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a line of text from the user and prints it back out.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a line of text: \")\n    print(\"You entered: \", user_input)\n\ndef main():\n    read_and_print_user_input()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `input` function is used to read a line of text from the user.\n2. The user's input is stored in the `user_input` variable.\n3. The `print` function is used to print the user's input back out.\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g. `read_and_print.py`) and run it from the command line using `python read_and_print.py`. When prompted, enter a line of text, and the program will print it back out.\n\n```\n$ python read_and_print.py\nPlease enter a line of text: Hello, World!\nYou entered:  Hello, World!\n```",
