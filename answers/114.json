  "prompt": "Write a program to count the occurrences of a given number in an array.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that counts the occurrences of a given number in an array:\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(array, num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given number in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        num (int): The number to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    return array.count(num)\n\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4]\nnum = 2\nprint(f\"The number {num} occurs {count_occurrences(array, num)} times in the array.\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `count_occurrences` that takes an array and a number as input and returns the number of occurrences of the given number in the array. We use the built-in `count` method of Python lists to achieve this.\n\nNote: The `count` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. Therefore, this program may not be efficient for large arrays. If you need to count occurrences in a large array, you may want to consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a dictionary or a hash table. \n\nHere is a more efficient version of the program using a dictionary to store the count of each number:\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(array, num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the occurrences of a given number in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The input array.\n        num (int): The number to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of occurrences of the given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    count_dict = {}\n    for i in array:\n        if i in count_dict:\n            count_dict[i] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[i] = 1\n    return count_dict.get(num, 0)\n\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4]\nnum = 2\nprint(f\"The number {num} occurs {count_occurrences(array, num)} times in the array.\")\n```\n\nIn this version, we create a dictionary `count_dict` where the keys are the numbers in the array and the values are their respective counts. We then use the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the count of the given number. If the number is not in the dictionary, the `get` method returns 0.",
