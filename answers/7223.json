  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The dictionary should have student names as keys and a list of grades as values. The program should allow users to add students, add grades for a student, and calculate the average grade for a student.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nclass StudentGrades:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize an empty dictionary to store student grades.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.student_grades = {}\n\n    def add_student(self, name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add a new student to the dictionary.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name of the student.\n        \"\"\"\n        if name not in self.student_grades:\n            self.student_grades[name] = []\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' already exists.\")\n\n    def add_grade(self, name, grade):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add a grade for a student.\n\n        Args:\n            name (str): The name of the student.\n            grade (float): The grade to be added.\n        \"\"\"\n        if name in self.student_grades:\n            self.student_grades[name].append(grade)\n            print(f\"Grade {grade} added for student '{name}'.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Student '{name}' does not exist.

To add a student, choose option 1 and enter the student's name.\n3. To add a grade for a student, choose option 2 and enter the student's name and the grade.\n4. To calculate the average grade for a student, choose option 3 and enter the student's name.\n5. To exit the program, choose option 4.\n\n### Notes\n* The program uses a `StudentGrades` class to encapsulate the data and methods.\n* The `add_student` method adds a new student to the dictionary.\n* The `add_grade` method adds a grade for a student.\n* The `calculate_average` method calculates the average grade for a student.\n* The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.",
