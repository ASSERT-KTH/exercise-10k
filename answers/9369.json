  "answer": "**Object Methods Demonstration**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that demonstrates the use of object methods. In this example, we'll create a `Vehicle` class with attributes and methods that can be used to interact with the object.\n\n```python\n# Define a Vehicle class\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Vehicle object.\n\n        Args:\n            brand (str): The brand of the vehicle.\n            model (str): The model of the vehicle.\n            year (int): The year of the vehicle.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.brand = brand\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.mileage = 0\n\n    def start_engine(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Start the vehicle's engine.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"The engine is started.\")\n\n    def drive(self, miles):\n        \"\"\"\n        Drive the vehicle for a specified number of miles.\n\n        Args:\n            miles (int): The number of miles to drive.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.mileage += miles\n        print(f\"You have driven {miles} miles.\")\n\n    def get_mileage(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get the current mileage of the vehicle.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The current mileage.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.mileage\n\n    def describe_vehicle(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print a description of the vehicle.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"This vehicle is a {self.year} {self.brand} {self.model} with {self.mileage} miles.\")\n\n\n# Create a Vehicle object\nmy_car = Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2015)\n\n# Demonstrate object methods\nprint(\"Demonstrating object methods:\")\nmy_car.describe_vehicle()\nmy_car.start_engine()\nmy_car.drive(100)\nprint(f\"Current mileage: {my_car.get_mileage()} miles\")\nmy_car.drive(50)\nprint(f\"Current mileage: {my_car.get_mileage()} miles\")\nmy_car.describe_vehicle()\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\nDemonstrating object methods:\nThis vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Corolla with 0 miles.\nThe engine is started.\nYou have driven 100 miles.\nCurrent mileage: 100 miles\nYou have driven 50 miles.\nCurrent mileage: 150 miles\nThis vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Corolla with 150 miles.\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a `Vehicle` class with the following methods:\n\n*   `__init__`: Initializes a `Vehicle` object with attributes like brand, model, year, and mileage.\n*   `start_engine`: Starts the vehicle's engine.\n*   `drive`: Drives the vehicle for a specified number of miles and updates the mileage.\n*   `get_mileage`: Returns the current mileage of the vehicle.\n*   `describe_vehicle`: Prints a description of the vehicle, including its brand, model, year, and mileage.\n\nWe then create a `Vehicle` object called `my_car` and demonstrate the use of these object methods by calling them on the `my_car` object.",
