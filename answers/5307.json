  "answer": "### Recursive Factorial Function\n\nHere's an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   If `n` is negative, the function raises a `ValueError` since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   The base cases for the recursion are when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1).\n*   For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with `n - 1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This recursive process continues until the base case is reached.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number (in this case, 5).",
