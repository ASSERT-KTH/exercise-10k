  "answer": "**Longest Word Finder Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the longest word in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_word(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest word in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest word in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n\n    # Initialize the longest word and its length\n    longest_word = max(words, key=len)\n\n    return longest_word\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_string = \"This is a test string with multiple words\"\n    longest_word = find_longest_word(input_string)\n    print(f\"The longest word is: {longest_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_longest_word` function takes a string as input and splits it into words using the `split` method.\n2. It then uses the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `len` to find the longest word in the list of words.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `find_longest_word` function with an example input string.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that words are separated by spaces. If words can be separated by other characters (e.g., tabs, commas), you may need to modify the `split` method accordingly.\n* If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, this program will return one of them. If you need to return all longest words, you can modify the program to keep track of all words with the maximum length.",
