  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for their personal information (name, age, address), and then prints out a formatted version of this information.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that asks the user for their personal information and then prints it out in a formatted way:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to get user information\ndef get_user_info():\n    \"\"\"Get user's personal information.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    age = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    address = input(\"Please enter your address: \")\n    return name, age, address\n\n# Define a function to print user information\ndef print_user_info(name, age, address):\n    \"\"\"Print user's personal information in a formatted way.\"\"\"\n    print(\"\\nUser Information:\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n    print(f\"Name: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Age: {age}\")\n    print(f\"Address: {address}\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    name, age, address = get_user_info()\n    print_user_info(name, age, address)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program consists of three functions:\n\n*   `get_user_info()`: This function asks the user to input their name, age, and address using the built-in `input()` function.\n*   `print_user_info()`: This function takes the user's name, age, and address as arguments and prints them out in a formatted way.\n*   `main()`: This is the main function of the program, which calls `get_user_info()` to get the user's information and then calls `print_user_info()` to print it out.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name, age, and address. After you enter this information, it will print out a formatted version of your personal information.\n\n```\nPlease enter your name: John Doe\nPlease enter your age: 30\nPlease enter your address: 123 Main St\n\nUser Information:\n--------------------\nName: John Doe\nAge: 30\nAddress: 123 Main St\n--------------------\n```",
