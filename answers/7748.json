  "prompt": "Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on them. The program should then output the results of these operations in a clear and readable format.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Importing the necessary modules\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Defining the functions\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef sub(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef mul(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef div(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    # Input validation\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please provide two numbers as arguments.\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert input to floats\n    try:\n        num1 = float(sys.argv[1])\n        num2 = float(sys.argv[2])\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please provide two numbers as arguments.\")\n        return\n\n    # Perform arithmetic operations\n    add_result = add(num1, num2)\n    sub_result = sub(num1, num2)\n    mul_result = mul(num1, num2)\n    div_result = div(num1, num2)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {add_result}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {sub_result}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {mul_result}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {div_result}\")\n\n# Running the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code defines the four basic arithmetic operations as functions, and then defines a `main` function that takes two numbers as input from the command line, performs the arithmetic operations, and prints the results. The `main` function is called using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard, which ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.",
