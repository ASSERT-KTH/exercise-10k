  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\n\n    # Print the area of the rectangle\n    print(\"The area of the rectangle is:\", area)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle.\n*   The `main` function gets the length and width of the rectangle from the user, calculates the area using the `calculate_area` function, and then prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters a length of 5 and a width of 3, the program will output: `The area of the rectangle is: 15.0`\n*   If the user enters a length of 10 and a width of 2, the program will output: `The area of the rectangle is: 20.0`\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_area` that takes `length` and `width` as arguments.\n2.  Calculate the area by multiplying `length` and `width`.\n3.  Return the calculated area.\n4.  Create a `main` function to get user input for `length` and `width`.\n5.  Call the `calculate_area` function with the user input and store the result in the `area` variable.\n6.  Print the calculated area.",
