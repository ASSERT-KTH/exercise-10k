  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two strings as input and returns the longest common prefix between them.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the longest common prefix between two strings.\n\n    Args:\n        str1 (str): The first input string.\n        str2 (str): The second input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix between str1 and str2.\n    \"\"\"\n    prefix = \"\"\n    for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2):\n        if char1 == char2:\n            prefix += char1\n        else:\n            break\n    return prefix\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    str1 = \"hello world\"\n    str2 = \"hello python\"\n    print(\"Longest common prefix:\", longest_common_prefix(str1, str2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `longest_common_prefix` function takes two strings as input, `str1` and `str2`.\n2. It initializes an empty string `prefix` to store the common prefix.\n3. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of both strings in parallel.\n4. For each pair of characters, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it appends the character to the `prefix` string.\n5. If the characters are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.\n6. Finally, the function returns the `prefix` string, which is the longest common prefix between the two input strings.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Input: `str1 = \"hello world\"`, `str2 = \"hello python\"`\n* Output: `Longest common prefix: hello`",
