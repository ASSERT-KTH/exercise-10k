  "prompt": "Create a program that stores student grades in a dictionary. The dictionary should have student names as keys and lists of grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and a grade, then add the grade to the student's list of grades. If the student is not in the dictionary, the program should add the student with the given grade. The program should continue prompting the user until the user decides to stop. Finally, the program should print out the dictionary of student grades.",

We then get the user's choice using the `input` function.\n4. **Adding Grades**: If the user chooses to add a grade, we get the student's name and grade using the `input` function. We then check if the student is already in the `student_grades` dictionary. If they are, we append the grade to their list of grades. If not, we add the student to the dictionary with the given grade.\n5. **Stopping and Printing**: If the user chooses to stop, we print out the `student_grades` dictionary and break out of the loop.\n6. **Invalid Input**: If the user enters an invalid option, we print an error message and prompt them to choose again.\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nWhen you run the program, it will first prompt you to choose an option. Let's say you choose to add a grade for a student. You'll be asked to enter the student's name and grade. If you enter a name that's not already in the dictionary, the student will be added with the given grade. If you enter a name that's already in the dictionary, the grade will be appended to the student's list of grades. You can continue adding grades for different students until you choose to stop. When you stop, the program will print out the dictionary of student grades.",
