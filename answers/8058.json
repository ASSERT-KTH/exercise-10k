  "answer": "**Product Recommendation Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses an if/else statement to recommend products based on user profiles.\n\n### Program Description\n\nThe program will ask the user for their age, income, and interests. Based on this information, it will recommend a product from the following categories:\n\n* Electronics (smartphones, laptops, tablets)\n* Fashion (clothing, accessories)\n* Home and Garden (furniture, decor)\n* Travel (flights, hotels, packages)\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_user_profile():\n    \"\"\"Get user profile information\"\"\"\n    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n    income = int(input(\"Enter your annual income: $\"))\n    interests = input(\"Enter your interests (e.g., sports, music, travel): \")\n    return age, income, interests\n\ndef recommend_product(age, income, interests):\n    \"\"\"Recommend a product based on user profile\"\"\"\n    if age < 25 and income < 50000:\n        # Young adult with low income, recommend affordable electronics\n        if \"gaming\" in interests.lower():\n            return \"Gaming Console\"\n        else:\n            return \"Budget Smartphone\"\n    elif age < 40 and income < 100000:\n        # Adult with medium income, recommend fashion products\n        if \"fashion\" in interests.lower():\n            return \"Designer Clothing\"\n        else:\n            return \"Accessories\"\n    elif age >= 40 and income >= 100000:\n        # Adult with high income, recommend high-end electronics or travel\n        if \"travel\" in interests.lower():\n            return \"Luxury Vacation Package\"\n        else:\n            return \"High-End Laptop\"\n    else:\n        # Default recommendation\n        return \"Home Decor\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main program function\"\"\"\n    age, income, interests = get_user_profile()\n    recommended_product = recommend_product(age, income, interests)\n    print(f\"Based on your profile, we recommend: {recommended_product}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Young adult with low income and interest in gaming:\n\t* Age: 22\n\t* Income: $30000\n\t* Interests: gaming\n\t* Recommended product: Gaming Console\n2. Adult with medium income and interest in fashion:\n\t* Age: 35\n\t* Income: $60000\n\t* Interests: fashion\n\t* Recommended product: Designer Clothing\n3. Adult with high income and interest in travel:\n\t* Age: 50\n\t* Income: $150000\n\t* Interests: travel\n\t* Recommended product: Luxury Vacation Package\n\n### Note\n\nThis program is a simple example and does not take into account many factors that can influence product recommendations, such as user behavior, purchase history, and preferences. In a real-world scenario, a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm would be used, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.",
