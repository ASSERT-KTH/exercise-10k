The `simulate_day` method generates a random event (1-5) and updates the stock prices accordingly.\n3. The `buy_stock` method checks if the market is open and if the buyer has sufficient funds. If both conditions are met, it prints a message indicating the purchase.\n4. The `sell_stock` method checks if the market is open and prints a message indicating the sale.\n5. The `main` function creates a `StockMarket` instance and provides a",
