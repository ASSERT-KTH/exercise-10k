  "answer": "**First Non-Repeating Character Function**\n=============================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function finds the first non-repeating character in a given string. It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each character and then iterates over the string to find the first character with a count of 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The first non-repeating character, or None if no such character exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the string to find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"aabbc\"\n    result = first_non_repeating_char(s)\n    if result:\n        print(f\"The first non-repeating character is: {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No non-repeating character found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Create a dictionary `char_count` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string to count the frequency of each character.\n3. Iterate over the string again to find the first character with a count of 1.\n4. If a non-repeating character is found, return it. Otherwise, return None.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over the string twice: once to count the frequency of each character and once to find the first non-repeating character.",
