  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the sum of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_of_numbers}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `add_numbers` function takes two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, as arguments and returns their sum.\n* The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers, calls `add_numbers` to calculate the sum, and then prints the result.\n* The program uses the `float` type to allow for decimal numbers.\n* The `input` function is used to get user input, and `print` is used to display the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the program and enter two integers, such as `2` and `3`, to see their sum.\n* Run the program and enter two decimal numbers, such as `2.5` and `3.8`, to see their sum.\n\nNote: This program does not include any error checking or handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to ensure that the user input is valid.",
