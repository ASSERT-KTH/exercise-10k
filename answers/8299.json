  "answer": "**Logarithm Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the logarithm of a given number using a specified base.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_logarithm(number, base):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the logarithm of a number with a specified base.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The number to calculate the logarithm of.\n        base (float): The base of the logarithm.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The logarithm of the number with the specified base.\n    \"\"\"\n    if number <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number must be greater than zero\")\n    if base <= 0 or base == 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base must be greater than zero and not equal to one\")\n\n    return math.log(number, base)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    number = 100\n    base = 10\n    result = calculate_logarithm(number, base)\n    print(f\"The logarithm of {number} with base {base} is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_logarithm` function takes two arguments: `number` and `base`.\n*   It checks if the `number` is greater than zero and if the `base` is greater than zero and not equal to one. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The `math.log` function from the Python `math` module is used to calculate the logarithm.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `calculate_logarithm` function.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `logarithm_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python logarithm_calculator.py`). The program will calculate and print the logarithm of 100 with base 10.\n\n**Note:** This program uses the `math.log` function, which calculates the natural logarithm by default. To calculate the logarithm with a specified base, we pass the base as the second argument to the `math.log` function.",
