  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the median of a set of numbers:\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a set of numbers.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The median of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list of numbers\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Find the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n    \n    # If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        median = numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements\n    else:\n        median = (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n    \n    return median\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [12, 4, 56, 7, 23, 11, 89, 34]\n    median = calculate_median(numbers)\n    print(f\"The median of the numbers is: {median}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `calculate_median` function takes a list of numbers as input and sorts it in ascending order using the `sort` method.\n2. It then finds the length of the list using the `len` function.\n3. If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle element, which is found using the expression `numbers[n // 2]`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.\n4. If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements, which are found using the expressions `numbers[n // 2 - 1]` and `numbers[n // 2]`.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the use of the `calculate_median` function by calculating the median of a sample list of numbers and printing the result.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only numbers. You may want to add error checking code to handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values.",
