The user inputs their choice, and the function generates a random choice and determines the winner.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_rock_paper_scissors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the user.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the possible choices\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n\n    # Get the user's choice\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n\n    # Validate the user's choice\n    while user_choice not in choices:\n        user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n    # Generate a random choice for the computer\n    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n    # Determine the winner\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n    elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n        if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n            print(f\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n    elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n        if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n            print(f\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n    elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n        if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n            print(f\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n    # Print the choices\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_rock_paper_scissors()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `play_rock_paper_scissors` defines the possible choices and gets the user's choice.\n2. It validates the user's choice to ensure it is one of the allowed options.\n3. The function generates a random choice for the computer using `random.choice`.\n4. It determines the winner based on the game's rules and prints the result.\n5. Finally, it prints the choices made by the user and the computer.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Run the function and enter \"rock\" when prompted.\n* Run the function and enter \"paper\" when prompted.\n* Run the function and enter \"scissors\" when prompted.\n* Run the function and enter an invalid choice (e.g., \"test\") to see the validation in action.",
