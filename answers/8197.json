  "answer": "**Tic Tac Toe Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using a while loop in Python.\n\n```python\n# Tic Tac Toe program\n\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)] # Initialize an empty board\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"Print the current state of the board.\"\"\"\n    row1 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[0], board[1], board[2])\n    row2 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[3], board[4], board[5])\n    row3 = '| {} | {} | {} |'.format(board[6], board[7], board[8])\n\n    print()\n    print(row1)\n    print(row2)\n    print(row3)\n    print()\n\ndef check_win():\n    \"\"\"Check if there is a winner.\"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != ' ':\n            return board[condition[0]]\n    if ' ' not in board:\n        return 'Tie'\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        move = input(\"Player {}, enter your move (1-9): \".format(current_player))\n        if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n            print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n            continue\n        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player\n        result = check_win()\n        if result:\n            print_board()\n            if result == 'Tie':\n                print(\"It's a tie!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Player {} wins!\".format(result))\n            break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The program initializes an empty board with 9 spaces.\n2. The `print_board` function prints the current state of the board.\n3. The `check_win` function checks if there is a winner by examining all possible win conditions.\n4. The `main` function uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the current player for their move.\n5. The program checks if the move is valid, and if not, asks the player to try again.\n6. The program updates the board with the player's move and checks if there is a winner.\n7. If there is a winner, the program prints the final board state and announces the winner. If the game is a tie, the program announces a tie.",
