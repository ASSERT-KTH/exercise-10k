  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the distance traveled and fuel consumed of a vehicle as input and outputs its fuel efficiency.",
  "answer": "**Fuel Efficiency Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle given the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance traveled in kilometers.\n        fuel (float): Fuel consumed in liters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter.\n    \"\"\"\n    if fuel == 0:\n        return 0\n    return distance / fuel\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    distance = float(input(\"Enter the distance traveled in kilometers: \"))\n    fuel = float(input(\"Enter the fuel consumed in liters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate fuel efficiency\n    fuel_efficiency = calculate_fuel_efficiency(distance, fuel)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The fuel efficiency of the vehicle is {fuel_efficiency:.2f} km/l.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter the distance traveled as 250 kilometers and fuel consumed as 20 liters to get a fuel efficiency of 12.50 km/l.\n* Enter the distance traveled as 500 kilometers and fuel consumed as 40 liters to get a fuel efficiency of 12.50 km/l.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `fuel_efficiency_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Run the program by typing `python fuel_efficiency_calculator.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the distance traveled and fuel consumed.\n5. The program will display the calculated fuel efficiency.",
