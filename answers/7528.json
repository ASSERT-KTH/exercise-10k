  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input, and returns a new string where every word is capitalized and the first letter of each word is doubled. For example, 'hello world' should become 'HhEllo WwOrld'.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that takes a string as input, capitalizes every word, and doubles the first letter of each word. This response will provide a clear plan and explanation to help you understand the implementation. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef double_first_letter_and_capitalize(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input, and returns a new string where every word is capitalized \n    and the first letter of each word is doubled.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A new string with every word capitalized and the first letter of each word doubled.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified words\n    modified_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word is not empty\n        if word:\n            # Double the first letter of the word\n            doubled_first_letter = word[0].upper() + word[0].lower()\n            \n            # Capitalize the rest of the word\n            capitalized_word = word[1:].capitalize()\n            \n            # Combine the doubled first letter and the capitalized word\n            modified_word = doubled_first_letter + capitalized_word\n            \n            # Add the modified word to the list of modified words\n            modified_words.append(modified_word)\n        else:\n            # If the word is empty, add it to the list of modified words as is\n            modified_words.append(word)\n\n    # Join the modified words back into a string separated by spaces\n    modified_string = ' '.join(modified_words)\n\n    # Return the modified string\n    return modified_string\n\n# Test the function\nprint(double_first_letter_and_capitalize('hello world'))  # Outputs: HhEllo WwOrld\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `double_first_letter_and_capitalize` takes an input string `s`, splits it into a list of words using the `split` method, and initializes an empty list `modified_words` to store the modified words.\n*   It then iterates over each word in the list, checks if the word is not empty, and doubles the first letter of the word by concatenating the uppercase and lowercase versions of the first character (`word[0].upper() + word[0].lower()`).\n*   The rest of the word is capitalized using the `capitalize` method (`word[1:].capitalize()`), and the modified word is created by combining the doubled first letter and the capitalized word.\n*   Finally, the modified words are joined back into a string separated by spaces using the `join` method, and the resulting string is returned as the output.",
