  "answer": "**Movie Rating Program**\n=======================\n\nThis program allows users to rate movies based on their genre and calculates the average rating for each genre.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nclass MovieRatingProgram:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.genre_ratings = {}\n\n    def add_movie(self):\n        \"\"\"Add a movie rating\"\"\"\n        title = input(\"Enter movie title: \")\n        genre = input(\"Enter movie genre: \")\n        rating = float(input(\"Enter movie rating (1-5): \"))\n\n        if genre in self.genre_ratings:\n            self.genre_ratings[genre].append(rating)\n        else:\n            self.genre_ratings[genre] = [rating]\n\n        print(f\"Movie '{title}' added with rating {rating} for genre '{genre}'\")\n\n    def get_average_rating(self):\n        \"\"\"Get the average rating for each genre\"\"\"\n        for genre, ratings in self.genre_ratings.items():\n            average_rating = sum(ratings) / len(ratings)\n            print(f\"Average rating for '{genre}': {average_rating:.2f}\")\n\n    def run(self):\n        \"\"\"Run the program\"\"\"\n        while True:\n            print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n            print(\"1. Add a movie rating\")\n            print(\"2. Get average ratings\")\n            print(\"3. Quit\")\n            choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n            if choice == \"1\":\n                self.add_movie()\n            elif choice == \"2\":\n                self.get_average_rating()\n            elif choice == \"3\":\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    program = MovieRatingProgram()\n    program.run()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The program uses a dictionary `genre_ratings` to store the ratings for each genre.\n2. The `add_movie` method prompts the user to enter the movie title, genre, and rating, and adds the rating to the corresponding genre in the dictionary.\n3. The `get_average_rating` method calculates the average rating for each genre by summing up all the ratings and dividing by the number of ratings.\n4. The `run` method provides a menu-driven interface for the user to add movie ratings, get average ratings, or quit the program.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose option 1 to add a movie rating.\n3. Enter the movie title, genre, and rating (e.g., \"Inception\", \"Action\", 5).\n4. Choose option 1 again to add another movie rating (e.g., \"The Shawshank Redemption\", \"Drama\", 5).\n5. Choose option 2 to get the average ratings for each genre.\n6. The program will display the average rating for each genre (e.g., \"Average rating for 'Action': 5.00\", \"Average rating for 'Drama': 5.00\").",
