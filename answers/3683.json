  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator using Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers, based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n    a (int): The first number.\n    b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.\n2. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0.\n3. In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively.\n4. Once `b` becomes 0, the function returns the absolute value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_gcd` function with example numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18: `calculate_gcd(48, 18)` returns 6\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns 6\n* Calculate the GCD of 12 and 15: `calculate_gcd(12, 15)` returns 3\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you may need to modify the program accordingly.",
