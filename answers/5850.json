Please ensure it meets the following conditions:\")\n        print(\"- The password must be at least 8 characters long.\")\n        print(\"- The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\")\n        print(\"- The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\")\n        print(\"- The password must contain at least one digit.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter a password.\n3. The program will print out a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This program uses Python's built-in `input` function to get the password from the user.\n- The `validate_password` function checks the password's length and character composition using the `any` function and generator expressions.\n- The `main` function handles user input and output.",
