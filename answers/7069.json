  "answer": "Here's a Python program that takes an encrypted string as input and decrypts it using a Caesar Cipher decryption algorithm. This program shifts each letter in the encrypted string back by a specified number of places in the alphabet to decrypt it.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_string(encrypted_string, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decrypts an encrypted string using Caesar Cipher decryption algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        encrypted_string (str): The encrypted string to be decrypted.\n        shift (int): The number of places each letter in the encrypted string should be shifted back.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The decrypted string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the decrypted string\n    decrypted_string = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the encrypted string\n    for char in encrypted_string:\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Calculate the ASCII value of the decrypted character\n            # The ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so we subtract 65 to get the position of the letter in the alphabet\n            # We then subtract the shift value and use the modulo operator to ensure the result is within the range of 0 to 25\n            # Finally, we add 65 to get the ASCII value of the decrypted character\n            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - 65 - shift) % 26 + 65)\n            # Append the decrypted character to the decrypted string\n            decrypted_string += decrypted_char\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Calculate the ASCII value of the decrypted character\n            # The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so we subtract 97 to get the position of the letter in the alphabet\n            # We then subtract the shift value and use the modulo operator to ensure the result is within the range of 0 to 25\n            # Finally, we add 97 to get the ASCII value of the decrypted character\n            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - 97 - shift) % 26 + 97)\n            # Append the decrypted character to the decrypted string\n            decrypted_string += decrypted_char\n        # If the character is not a letter, append it to the decrypted string as is\n        else:\n            decrypted_string += char\n\n    # Return the decrypted string\n    return decrypted_string\n\n\n# Example usage:\nencrypted_string = \"Khoor Zruog\"\nshift = 3\ndecrypted_string = decrypt_string(encrypted_string, shift)\nprint(f\"Encrypted String: {encrypted_string}\")\nprint(f\"Shift: {shift}\")\nprint(f\"Decrypted String: {decrypted_string}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, the `decrypt_string` function takes an encrypted string and a shift value as input and returns the decrypted string. The function uses the Caesar Cipher decryption algorithm to shift each letter in the encrypted string back by the specified number of places in the alphabet. The program then prints the encrypted string, the shift value, and the decrypted string.\n\nWhen you run this program with the example usage, it will decrypt the string \"Khoor Zruog\" with a shift of 3 and print the decrypted string, which is \"Hello World\".",
