  "prompt": "Write a program that uses conditional statements to determine a student's grade based on their score. The grade is 'A' if the score is 90 or above, 'B' if the score is between 80 and 89, 'C' if the score is between 70 and 79, 'D' if the score is between 60 and 69, and 'F' if the score is below 60.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specification:\n```\ndef get_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\nscore = 85\nletter_grade = get_grade(score)\nprint(\"Score: {}, Grade: {}\".format(score, letter_grade))\n```\nThis code defines the `get_grade` function, which takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the conditional statements. The score and letter grade are then printed to the console using the `format` method.",
