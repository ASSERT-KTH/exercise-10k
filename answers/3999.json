We initialize a table `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. The cell `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the shortest common supersequence of the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`.\n2.  We fill in the table using the following recurrence relation:\n\n    *   If `str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`, because we can match the current characters and add 1 to the length of the SCS.\n    *   Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1`, because we need to choose the shorter of the two possible SCS's and add 1 to its length.\n3.  We reconstruct the SCS from the table by tracing back the path from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner. We append characters to the SCS based on the values in the table.\n4.  Finally, we return the SCS as a string.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n--------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n---------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), because we need to store the table `dp` of size (m + 1) x (n + 1).",
