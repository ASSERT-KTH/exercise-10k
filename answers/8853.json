  "answer": "**Power of 2 Check Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function checks if a given integer is a power of 2 or not. It uses the bitwise AND operator to achieve this.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a given integer is a power of 2.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a power of 2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 3, 5, 6, 10]\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(f\"{num} is a power of 2: {is_power_of_two(num)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `is_power_of_two` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it's a power of 2.\n*   If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it's not a power of 2, so the function returns `False`.\n*   The expression `n & (n - 1)` performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`.\n*   In binary representation, powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to 1 (the bit in the place that corresponds to that power of 2). For example, 8 is 1000 in binary.\n*   When you subtract 1 from a power of 2, you get a number that has all the bits set to the right of the first 1 in the original number. For example, 7 (8 - 1) is 0111 in binary.\n*   The bitwise AND of a power of 2 and the number one less than it will always be 0, because there are no bits that are 1 in both numbers.\n*   Therefore, if `n` is a power of 2, `(n & (n - 1))` will be 0, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   This function has a time complexity of O(1), because it only performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size.",
