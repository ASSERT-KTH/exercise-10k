  "prompt": "Given two sequences, find the length of the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABCDE' and 'ABFCD' is 'ABC'. Your task is to write a function to compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences.",
  "answer": "**Longest Common Subsequence Problem**\n\nThe longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. Given two sequences, the goal is to find the length of the longest common subsequence between them.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences.\n\n    Args:\n    seq1 (str): The first sequence.\n    seq2 (str): The second sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The length of the longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * (len(seq2) + 1) for _ in range(len(seq1) + 1)]\n\n    # Iterate over the characters in both sequences\n    for i in range(1, len(seq1) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(seq2) + 1):\n            # If the current characters match, increase the length of the common subsequence\n            if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            # Otherwise, take the maximum length from the previous characters\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the array\n    return dp[-1][-1]\n\n\n# Example usage\nseq1 = \"ABCDE\"\nseq2 = \"ABFCD\"\nprint(\"Length of longest common subsequence:\", longest_common_subsequence(seq1, seq2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The solution uses a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of common subsequences.\n*   The array is initialized with zeros, and its size is `(len(seq1) + 1) x (len(seq2) + 1)`.\n*   The function iterates over the characters in both sequences using nested loops.\n*   If the current characters match, the length of the common subsequence is increased by 1.\n*   Otherwise, the maximum length from the previous characters is taken.\n*   The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in the bottom-right corner of the array and returned as the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), where n and m are the lengths of the input sequences. This is because the solution uses two nested loops to iterate over the characters in both sequences.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n \\* m), which is the size of the 2D array used to store the lengths of common subsequences.",
