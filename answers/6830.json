The function supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nThe `main` function gets two numbers and an operation from the user, calls the `calculate` function with the provided input, and prints the result. If the user enters an invalid operation or attempts to divide by zero, the program catches the resulting exception and prints an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and choose the `add` operation. The program will output `The result of adding 10.0 and 5.0 is 15.0`.\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and choose the `divide` operation. The program will output `The result of dividing 10.0 and 5.0 is 2.0`.\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `0` as the second number, and choose the `divide` operation. The program will output `Cannot divide by zero`.\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and choose an invalid operation. The program will output `Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'.`.",
