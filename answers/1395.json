  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to display the weather forecast for the next 5 days.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that displays the weather forecast for the next 5 days using a while loop:\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary to store the weather forecast\nweather_forecast = {\n    \"Day 1\": \"Sunny\",\n    \"Day 2\": \"Cloudy\",\n    \"Day 3\": \"Rainy\",\n    \"Day 4\": \"Windy\",\n    \"Day 5\": \"Sunny\"\n}\n\n# Initialize a counter variable\nday = 1\n\n# Use a while loop to display the weather forecast\nwhile day <= 5:\n    # Print the weather forecast for the current day\n    print(f\"Weather forecast for Day {day}: {weather_forecast[f'Day {day}']}\")\n    \n    # Increment the counter variable\n    day += 1\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will display the weather forecast for the next 5 days. Here's the output:\n\n```\nWeather forecast for Day 1: Sunny\nWeather forecast for Day 2: Cloudy\nWeather forecast for Day 3: Rainy\nWeather forecast for Day 4: Windy\nWeather forecast for Day 5: Sunny\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to use a while loop to iterate over a range of values (in this case, the days of the week) and perform an action for each value (displaying the weather forecast).",
