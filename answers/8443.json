  "answer": "**Shipping Cost Calculator Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program takes in a weight as input and calculates the corresponding shipping cost using conditional statements.\n\n**Code**\n```python\ndef calculate_shipping_cost(weight):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate shipping cost based on weight.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): Weight of the package in pounds.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Shipping cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    if weight <= 2:\n        return 3.00\n    elif weight <= 6:\n        return 5.00\n    elif weight <= 10:\n        return 7.00\n    else:\n        return 10.00 + (weight - 10) * 0.50\n\ndef main():\n    # Get weight from user\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter weight in pounds: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display shipping cost\n    shipping_cost = calculate_shipping_cost(weight)\n    print(f\"Shipping cost: ${shipping_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program defines a `calculate_shipping_cost` function that takes a weight as input and returns the corresponding shipping cost. The function uses conditional statements to determine the shipping cost based on the weight.\n\n*   For weights up to 2 pounds, the shipping cost is $3.00.\n*   For weights between 2 and 6 pounds, the shipping cost is $5.00.\n*   For weights between 6 and 10 pounds, the shipping cost is $7.00.\n*   For weights above 10 pounds, the shipping cost is $10.00 plus $0.50 per pound for each pound above 10.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter a weight, calculates the shipping cost using the `calculate_shipping_cost` function, and displays the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Enter a weight of 1.5 pounds: Shipping cost = $3.00\n*   Enter a weight of 4 pounds: Shipping cost = $5.00\n*   Enter a weight of 8 pounds: Shipping cost = $7.00\n*   Enter a weight of 12 pounds: Shipping cost = $10.00 + (12 - 10) \\* 0.50 = $11.00\n\nTo run the program, save the code to a file (e.g., `shipping_cost_calculator.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python shipping_cost_calculator.py`). Follow the prompt to enter a weight, and the program will display the calculated shipping cost.",
