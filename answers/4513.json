  "answer": "**Quiz Game Program**\n======================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program simulates a quiz game where the user is presented with a series of questions. The program keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback on their answers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the random module to shuffle questions\nimport random\n\n# Define a dictionary to store questions, answers, and options\nquestions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Berlin\",\n        \"B\": \"Paris\",\n        \"C\": \"London\",\n        \"D\": \"Rome\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Earth\",\n        \"B\": \"Saturn\",\n        \"C\": \"Jupiter\",\n        \"D\": \"Uranus\",\n        \"answer\": \"C\"\n    },\n    \"Who painted the Mona Lisa?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\",\n        \"B\": \"Michelangelo\",\n        \"C\": \"Raphael\",\n        \"D\": \"Caravaggio\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    },\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Ag\",\n        \"B\": \"Au\",\n        \"C\": \"Hg\",\n        \"D\": \"Pb\",\n        \"answer\": \"B\"\n    },\n    \"What is the smallest country in the world?\": {\n        \"A\": \"Vatican City\",\n        \"B\": \"Monaco\",\n        \"C\": \"Nauru\",\n        \"D\": \"Tuvalu\",\n        \"answer\": \"A\"\n    }\n}\n\ndef play_quiz():\n    # Initialize score\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Shuffle questions\n    question_list = list(questions.items())\n    random.shuffle(question_list)\n    \n    # Iterate through questions\n    for question, options in question_list:\n        print(f\"\\nQuestion: {question}\")\n        for option, value in options.items():\n            if option != \"answer\":\n                print(f\"{option}: {value}\")\n        \n        # Get user's answer\n        user_answer = input(\"\\nEnter your answer (A, B, C, D): \")\n        \n        # Check if user's answer is correct\n        if user_answer.upper() == options[\"answer\"]:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {options['answer']}.\")\n    \n    # Print final score\n    print(f\"\\nQuiz finished. Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.\")\n\n# Run the quiz\nplay_quiz()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Answer each question by entering the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D).\n3. The program will provide feedback on your answers and keep track of your score.\n4. After all questions have been answered, the program will display your final score.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The questions and answers are stored in a dictionary for easy modification and addition of new questions.\n* The `random` module is used to shuffle the questions, ensuring a different order each time the program is run.\n* The program uses a simple text-based interface for user input and feedback.",
