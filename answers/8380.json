  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the natural logarithm of a given number using the Taylor series expansion:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_ln_taylor(x, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the natural logarithm of a given number using the Taylor series expansion.\n\n    Args:\n        x (float): The input number.\n        n (int): The number of terms to consider in the Taylor series expansion.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The approximate natural logarithm of x.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if x is within the valid range\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number.\")\n\n    # Initialize the sum\n    ln_x = 0\n\n    # Calculate the Taylor series expansion\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the sign of the current term\n        sign = (-1) ** (i + 1)\n\n        # Calculate the current term\n        term = (x - 1) ** i / i\n\n        # Add the current term to the sum\n        ln_x += sign * term\n\n    return ln_x\n\n# Example usage\nx = 2\nn = 100  # Number of terms to consider\nln_x = calculate_ln_taylor(x, n)\n\nprint(f\"The natural logarithm of {x} using Taylor series expansion is approximately {ln_x:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"The actual natural logarithm of {x} is {math.log(x):.6f}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `calculate_ln_taylor` that calculates the natural logarithm of a given number `x` using the Taylor series expansion up to `n` terms. It checks if `x` is within the valid range (i.e., `x > 0`), initializes the sum, and calculates the Taylor series expansion using a loop. The Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm is given by:\n\n`ln(x) = (x - 1) - (x - 1)^2/2 + (x - 1)^3/3 - (x - 1)^4/4 + ...`\n\nThe program then returns the approximate natural logarithm of `x`. In the example usage, it calculates the natural logarithm of `2` using the Taylor series expansion with `100` terms and compares it with the actual natural logarithm calculated using the `math.log` function.",
