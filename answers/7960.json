  "answer": "**Object-Oriented Programming Example in Python**\n==============================================\n\nBelow is an example program that demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes and objects in Python.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define a class called \"Vehicle\"\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Vehicle object.\n        \n        Args:\n            brand (str): The brand of the vehicle.\n            model (str): The model of the vehicle.\n            year (int): The year of the vehicle.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.brand = brand\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.mileage = 0\n\n    def drive(self, miles):\n        \"\"\"\n        Increase the mileage of the vehicle.\n        \n        Args:\n            miles (int): The number of miles to drive.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.mileage += miles\n\n    def describe_vehicle(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print a description of the vehicle.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"This vehicle is a {self.year} {self.brand} {self.model} with {self.mileage} miles.\")\n\n\n# Define a subclass called \"Car\" that inherits from \"Vehicle\"\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, doors):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Car object.\n        \n        Args:\n            brand (str): The brand of the car.\n            model (str): The model of the car.\n            year (int): The year of the car.\n            doors (int): The number of doors on the car.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(brand, model, year)\n        self.doors = doors\n\n    def describe_vehicle(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print a description of the car.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().describe_vehicle()\n        print(f\"It has {self.doors} doors.\")\n\n\n# Define a subclass called \"Truck\" that inherits from \"Vehicle\"\nclass Truck(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, capacity):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Truck object.\n        \n        Args:\n            brand (str): The brand of the truck.\n            model (str): The model of the truck.\n            year (int): The year of the truck.\n            capacity (int): The capacity of the truck.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(brand, model, year)\n        self.capacity = capacity\n\n    def describe_vehicle(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Print a description of the truck.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().describe_vehicle()\n        print(f\"It has a capacity of {self.capacity} tons.\")\n\n\n# Create objects and demonstrate OOP principles\ndef main():\n    # Create a Vehicle object\n    vehicle = Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2015)\n    vehicle.describe_vehicle()\n    vehicle.drive(100)\n    vehicle.describe_vehicle()\n\n    print()\n\n    # Create a Car object\n    car = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2020, 4)\n    car.describe_vehicle()\n    car.drive(50)\n    car.describe_vehicle()\n\n    print()\n\n    # Create a Truck object\n    truck = Truck(\"Ford\", \"F-150\", 2018, 2)\n    truck.describe_vehicle()\n    truck.drive(200)\n    truck.describe_vehicle()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program demonstrates the following OOP principles:\n\n1.  **Encapsulation**: The `Vehicle` class encapsulates the attributes and methods related to a vehicle, such as its brand, model, year, and mileage.\n2.  **Inheritance**: The `Car` and `Truck` classes inherit the attributes and methods from the `Vehicle` class and add their own specific attributes and methods.\n3.  **Polymorphism**: The `describe_vehicle` method is overridden in the `Car` and `Truck` classes to provide a more specific description of each type of vehicle.\n4.  **Abstraction**: The program abstracts away the underlying details of each vehicle type and provides a simple interface to interact with them.\n\nThe `main` function creates objects of each vehicle type and demonstrates the OOP principles by calling methods and accessing attributes.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run the program, you should see the following output:\n```\nThis vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Corolla with 0 miles.\nThis vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Corolla with 100 miles.\n\nThis vehicle is a 2020 Honda Civic with 0 miles.\nIt has 4 doors.\nThis vehicle is a 2020 Honda Civic with 50 miles.\nIt has 4 doors.\n\nThis vehicle is a 2018 Ford F-150 with 0 miles.\nIt has a capacity of 2 tons.\nThis vehicle is a 2018 Ford F-150 with 200 miles.\nIt has a capacity of 2 tons.\n```",
