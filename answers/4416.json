  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate Element in a List using a While Loop**\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to find the first duplicate element in a list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first duplicate element in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to search for duplicates.\n\n    Returns:\n        The first duplicate element in the list, or None if no duplicates are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input_list):\n        if input_list[i] in seen:\n            return input_list[i]\n        seen.add(input_list[i])\n        i += 1\n    return None\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_list = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n    duplicate = find_first_duplicate(input_list)\n    if duplicate is not None:\n        print(f\"The first duplicate element in the list is {duplicate}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No duplicates found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We initialize an empty set `seen` to store the unique elements we've encountered so far.\n*   We use a while loop to iterate over the input list, keeping track of the current index `i`.\n*   Inside the loop, we check if the current element is already in the `seen` set. If it is, we return the current element as the first duplicate.\n*   If the current element is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and move to the next element in the list.\n*   If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, we return None to indicate that no duplicates were found.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in the list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst-case scenario, we might need to store all elements in the `seen` set.",
