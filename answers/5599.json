  "prompt": "Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that raises one number to the power of another, as per your request. This will involve a straightforward approach using Python's built-in functionality. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef power_function(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the power of a given base and exponent.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    base (float): The base number\n    exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the base raised to the power of the exponent\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the inputs are numbers. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(base, (int, float)) or not isinstance(exponent, (int, float)):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both base and exponent must be numbers\")\n\n    # Now, we use the built-in ** operator in Python to calculate the power.\n    # This operator returns the value of the left operand raised to the power of the right operand.\n    result = base ** exponent\n\n    # Finally, we return the calculated result.\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `power_function` starts by validating the input types for `base` and `exponent` to ensure they are either integers or floats. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then utilizes Python's built-in exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the power of `base` raised to `exponent` and stores this result in the `result` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the calculated `result`, providing the outcome of the exponentiation operation.\n* The use of clear parameter names like `base` and `exponent`, along with a descriptive docstring, enhances the function's readability and usability.",
