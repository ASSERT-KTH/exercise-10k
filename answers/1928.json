  "prompt": "Write a program that declares a boolean variable and checks its value using an if statement.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple program in Python that declares a boolean variable and checks its value using an if statement:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Declare a boolean variable\n    is_true = True\n\n    # Check the value of the boolean variable\n    if is_true:\n        print(\"The boolean variable is True.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The boolean variable is False.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, `is_true` is a boolean variable that is initially set to `True`. The if statement checks the value of `is_true`. If it's `True`, the program prints \"The boolean variable is True.\" If it's `False`, the program prints \"The boolean variable is False.\" You can change the value of `is_true` to `False` to see the different output.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a more concise version of the program:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    is_true = True\n    print(\"The boolean variable is True\" if is_true else \"The boolean variable is False\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to print the result in a single line.",
