  "answer": "### Product Price Dictionary and Total Price Calculation\n\nHere's an example Python code snippet that creates a dictionary with product names as keys and their prices as values, then calculates and prints the total price of all products.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_price(product_prices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total price of all products.\n\n    Args:\n        product_prices (dict): Dictionary with product names as keys and their prices as values.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total price of all products.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_price = sum(product_prices.values())\n    return total_price\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a dictionary with product names as keys and their prices as values\n    product_prices = {\n        \"Apple\": 1.00,\n        \"Banana\": 0.50,\n        \"Orange\": 1.50,\n        \"Milk\": 2.00,\n        \"Bread\": 1.25\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the total price of all products\n    total_price = calculate_total_price(product_prices)\n\n    # Print the product prices and total price\n    print(\"Product Prices:\")\n    for product, price in product_prices.items():\n        print(f\"{product}: ${price:.2f}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Price: ${total_price:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We define a function `calculate_total_price` that takes a dictionary `product_prices` as input and returns the total price of all products by summing up the dictionary values.\n2. In the `main` function, we create a dictionary `product_prices` with sample product names and their prices.\n3. We call the `calculate_total_price` function to calculate the total price of all products.\n4. Finally, we print the product prices and the total price.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nProduct Prices:\nApple: $1.00\nBanana: $0.50\nOrange: $1.50\nMilk: $2.00\nBread: $1.25\n\nTotal Price: $6.25\n```",
