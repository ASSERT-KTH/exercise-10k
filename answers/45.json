  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix**\n=========================\n\nThe longest common prefix of an array of strings is the longest prefix that is common to all strings in the array.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of the strings in parallel, and the `set` function to check if all characters at the current position are the same.\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest common prefix of an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    prefix = []\n    for chars in zip(*strs):\n        if len(set(chars)) == 1:\n            prefix.append(chars[0])\n        else:\n            break\n    return \"\".join(prefix)\n\n# Example usage:\nstrs = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strs))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `prefix` to store the common prefix characters.\n2. Use the `zip` function to iterate over the characters of the strings in parallel.\n3. For each position, check if all characters are the same by converting them to a set and checking if the set has only one element.\n4. If all characters are the same, append the character to the `prefix` list.\n5. If not, break out of the loop.\n6. Finally, join the `prefix` list into a string and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the length of the shortest string and m is the number of strings.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the longest common prefix.",
