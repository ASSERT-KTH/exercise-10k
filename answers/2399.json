  "answer": "**Flower Pattern Generator**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that generates a flower pattern using a while loop.\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\ndef draw_petal(turtle, radius, angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Draw a petal of the flower.\n\n    Args:\n        turtle (turtle.Turtle): The turtle object to use for drawing.\n        radius (int): The radius of the petal.\n        angle (int): The angle of the petal.\n    \"\"\"\n    turtle.circle(radius, angle)\n    turtle.left(180 - angle)\n    turtle.circle(radius, angle)\n\ndef draw_flower(turtle, num_petals, radius, angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Draw a flower with the specified number of petals.\n\n    Args:\n        turtle (turtle.Turtle): The turtle object to use for drawing.\n        num_petals (int): The number of petals in the flower.\n        radius (int): The radius of each petal.\n        angle (int): The angle of each petal.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0\n    while i < num_petals:\n        draw_petal(turtle, radius, angle)\n        turtle.left(360 / num_petals)\n        i += 1\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new turtle screen and set its background color\n    screen = turtle.Screen()\n    screen.bgcolor(\"white\")\n\n    # Create a new turtle object\n    my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()\n    my_turtle.speed(1)  # Set the speed of the turtle\n\n    # Draw a flower with 10 petals\n    draw_flower(my_turtle, 10, 100, 60)\n\n    # Keep the window open until it is closed by the user\n    turtle.done()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nTo generate a flower pattern with 10 petals, each with a radius of 100 units and an angle of 60 degrees, you can run the above program. The `main` function creates a new turtle screen and object, and then calls the `draw_flower` function to generate the flower pattern.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n----------------------\n\n* You can adjust the number of petals, radius, and angle to create different flower patterns.\n* You can also change the color of the turtle and the background of the screen to create different visual effects.\n* To create a more complex flower pattern, you can use nested while loops or recursive functions to draw multiple layers of petals.",
