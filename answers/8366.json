  "answer": "**Arithmetic Sequence Generator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program generates an arithmetic sequence of a given length with a given common difference.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic sequence of a given length with a given common difference.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_difference (float): The common difference between terms.\n        length (int): The length of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The generated arithmetic sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [first_term + i * common_difference for i in range(length)]\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    first_term = float(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_difference = float(input(\"Enter the common difference: \"))\n    length = int(input(\"Enter the length of the sequence: \"))\n\n    sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(first_term, common_difference, length)\n    print(\"Arithmetic Sequence:\")\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the first term, common difference, and length of the sequence when prompted.\n3. The program will generate and print the arithmetic sequence.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nEnter the first term: 2\nEnter the common difference: 3\nEnter the length of the sequence: 5\nArithmetic Sequence:\n[2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 14.0]\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function takes in three parameters: `first_term`, `common_difference`, and `length`.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to generate the arithmetic sequence.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for input and calls the `generate_arithmetic_sequence` function.\n4. The generated sequence is then printed to the console.",
