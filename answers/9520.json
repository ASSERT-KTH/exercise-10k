  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input from the user and performs the specified operation. The program should then output the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    operation = input(\"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n    # Perform the specified operation\n    if operation == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"/\":\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n            return\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /. \")\n        return\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `calculator` function gets two numbers and an operation as input from the user.\n2. It then checks the operation and performs the corresponding calculation.\n3. If the user attempts to divide by zero, it prints an error message and exits the function.\n4. If the user enters an invalid operation, it prints an error message and exits the function.\n5. Finally, it prints the result of the operation.\n\nYou can run this program, enter the numbers and operation when prompted, and it will output the result. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 2\nEnter the operation (+, -, *, /): +\n10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0\n```",
