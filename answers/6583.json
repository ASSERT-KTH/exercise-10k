  "answer": "**Finding the First Duplicate in an Array of Integers**\n===========================================================\n\nHere is a Python program that finds the first duplicate in an array of integers:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_duplicate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the first duplicate in an array of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The first duplicate found in the array. If no duplicates are found, returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\nfirst_duplicate = find_first_duplicate(arr)\n\nif first_duplicate is not None:\n    print(f\"The first duplicate found in the array is: {first_duplicate}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No duplicates found in the array.\")\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1.  We create an empty set `seen` to store the numbers we have encountered so far.\n2.  We iterate through each number `num` in the input array `arr`.\n3.  For each number, we check if it is already in the `seen` set. If it is, it means we have encountered this number before, so it is a duplicate. We return this number as the first duplicate.\n4.  If the number is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue with the next number in the array.\n5.  If we finish iterating through the entire array without finding any duplicates, we return `None` to indicate that no duplicates were found.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are iterating through the array once, and the set operations (addition and lookup) take constant time on average.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n-------------------\n\nThe space complexity of this program is also O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, we may need to store all numbers from the array in the `seen` set.",
