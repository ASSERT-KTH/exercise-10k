  "answer": "**Word Count Program**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a sentence as input and returns the number of words in the sentence. It uses if/else statements to handle different input scenarios.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef count_words(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of words in a sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        sentence (str): The input sentence.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of words in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()\n    word_count = 0\n\n    if words:  # Check if the list of words is not empty\n        word_count = len(words)\n    else:\n        print(\"The sentence is empty.\")\n\n    return word_count\n\ndef main():\n    sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n    word_count = count_words(sentence)\n\n    if word_count > 0:\n        print(f\"The sentence contains {word_count} word{'s' if word_count > 1 else ''}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No words found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: \"Hello world\" - Output: \"The sentence contains 2 words.\"\n* Input: \"This is a test sentence\" - Output: \"The sentence contains 5 words.\"\n* Input: \"\" (empty string) - Output: \"The sentence is empty. No words found.\"\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `count_words` function splits the input sentence into a list of words using the `split` method.\n2. It checks if the list of words is not empty using an if statement.\n3. If the list is not empty, it returns the length of the list (i.e., the number of words).\n4. If the list is empty, it prints a message indicating that the sentence is empty.\n5. The `main` function takes user input, calls the `count_words` function, and prints the result.",
