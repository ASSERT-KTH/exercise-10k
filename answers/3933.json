  "answer": "**Mode Calculation Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the mode of a given list of numbers. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_mode(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mode of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of modes (in case of multiple modes).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    frequency = Counter(numbers)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n\n    # Find all numbers with the maximum frequency\n    modes = [num for num, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]\n\n    return modes\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]\n    modes = calculate_mode(numbers)\n    print(\"Mode(s):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_mode` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of modes.\n2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number.\n3. It finds the maximum frequency by taking the maximum value from the frequency dictionary.\n4. It finds all numbers with the maximum frequency using a list comprehension.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_mode` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program returns all modes if there are multiple modes (i.e., multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency).\n* If the input list is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the maximum frequency. You may want to add error handling to handle this case.",
