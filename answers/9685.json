  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a string as input and checks if it contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces. If the string is valid, return 'Valid', otherwise return 'Invalid'. The function should be case-sensitive.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that checks if a given string contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces, providing a clear and step-by-step solution. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a given string contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: 'Valid' if the string is valid, 'Invalid' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We want to check each character in the string, so we'll use a loop to iterate over the string\n    for char in s:\n        \n        # For each character, we'll use the isalnum() method to check if it's alphanumeric and the isspace() method to check if it's a space\n        # If the character is neither alphanumeric nor a space, we immediately return 'Invalid'\n        if not (char.isalnum() or char.isspace()):\n            return 'Invalid'\n    \n    # If we've checked all characters and haven't returned 'Invalid', then the string is valid\n    return 'Valid'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_string` iterates over each character `char` in the input string `s` to check its validity.\n* Inside the loop, it uses the `isalnum()` method to check if a character is alphanumeric and the `isspace()` method to check if it's a space. If the character is neither alphanumeric nor a space, the function immediately returns `'Invalid'`.\n* If the function completes checking all characters without returning `'Invalid'`, it returns `'Valid'`, indicating that the string meets the specified criteria.\n* This approach ensures that the function is case-sensitive, as required, and only returns `'Valid'` for strings containing alphanumeric characters and spaces.",
