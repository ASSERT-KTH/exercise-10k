  "answer": "**Logical Operators Comparison Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses logical operators to compare two variables and print the results.\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Define two variables\nvar1 = 10\nvar2 = 5\n\n# Compare variables using logical operators\nprint(\"Logical AND (and):\", var1 > 5 and var2 < 10)\nprint(\"Logical OR (or):\", var1 > 5 or var2 < 0)\nprint(\"Logical NOT (not):\", not var1 == 10)\n\n# Compare variables using equality operators\nprint(\"Equal (==):\", var1 == var2)\nprint(\"Not Equal (!=):\", var1 != var2)\nprint(\"Greater Than (>):\", var1 > var2)\nprint(\"Less Than (<):\", var1 < var2)\nprint(\"Greater Than or Equal (>=):\", var1 >= var2)\nprint(\"Less Than or Equal (<=):\", var1 <= var2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program defines two variables `var1` and `var2` with values 10 and 5, respectively. It then uses logical operators to compare these variables and print the results.\n\n*   `and` operator returns `True` if both conditions are true.\n*   `or` operator returns `True` if either condition is true.\n*   `not` operator returns the opposite of the condition.\n\nAdditionally, the program uses equality operators to compare the variables:\n\n*   `==` checks for equality.\n*   `!=` checks for inequality.\n*   `>` checks if the first variable is greater than the second.\n*   `<` checks if the first variable is less than the second.\n*   `>=` checks if the first variable is greater than or equal to the second.\n*   `<=` checks if the first variable is less than or equal to the second.\n\n### Example Output\n```\nLogical AND (and): True\nLogical OR (or): True\nLogical NOT (not): False\nEqual (==): False\nNot Equal (!=): True\nGreater Than (>): True\nLess Than (<): False\nGreater Than or Equal (>=): True\nLess Than or Equal (<=): False\n```",
