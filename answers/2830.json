  "answer": "**Triangle Type Determiner**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program determines the type of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides.\nIt categorizes triangles into three types: equilateral, isosceles, and scalene.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef determine_triangle_type(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the type of a triangle based on its sides.\n\n    Args:\n    a (float): The length of side a.\n    b (float): The length of side b.\n    c (float): The length of side c.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The type of the triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if all sides are equal (equilateral)\n    if a == b == c:\n        return \"Equilateral\"\n\n    # Check if two sides are equal (isosceles)\n    elif a == b or a == c or b == c:\n        return \"Isosceles\"\n\n    # If all sides are different, it's a scalene triangle\n    else:\n        return \"Scalene\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    print(\"Triangle Type Determiner\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    a = float(input(\"Enter the length of side a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter the length of side b: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter the length of side c: \"))\n\n    # Check if the sides can form a valid triangle\n    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:\n        triangle_type = determine_triangle_type(a, b, c)\n        print(f\"The triangle is {triangle_type}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The sides cannot form a valid triangle.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `determine_triangle_type` function takes the lengths of three sides as input and returns the type of the triangle.\n2. It checks the conditions for each type of triangle:\n   * Equilateral: all sides are equal.\n   * Isosceles: two sides are equal.\n   * Scalene: all sides are different.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `determine_triangle_type` function.\n4. It prompts the user to enter the lengths of the sides and checks if the sides can form a valid triangle.\n5. If the sides are valid, it determines the type of the triangle and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Equilateral triangle: sides a = 5, b = 5, c = 5\n* Isosceles triangle: sides a = 4, b = 4, c = 6\n* Scalene triangle: sides a = 3, b = 4, c = 5\n\nNote: This program assumes that the user will enter valid side lengths that can form a triangle. It checks for this condition before determining the type of the triangle.",
