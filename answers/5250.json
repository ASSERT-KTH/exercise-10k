  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the result of exponentiating a number to a given power.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_exponent(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of exponentiating a base number to a given power.\n\n    Args:\n    base (float): The base number.\n    exponent (float): The power to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n# Example usage:\nbase = 2.0\nexponent = 3.0\nresult = calculate_exponent(base, exponent)\nprint(f\"The result of {base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n*   The function `calculate_exponent` takes two parameters: `base` and `exponent`.\n*   It uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the result of raising the `base` to the power of the `exponent`.\n*   The result is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we call the `calculate_exponent` function with `base` as 2.0 and `exponent` as 3.0, and print the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because the exponentiation operation is a constant-time operation in Python.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.",
