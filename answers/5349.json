  "prompt": "Create a function that takes an array and a reduction function as input, and returns the reduced value of the array elements.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nconst reduce = (arr, fn) => {\n  let acc = arr[0];\n  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    acc = fn(acc, arr[i]);\n  }\n  return acc;\n};\n\nconst sum = (a, b) => a + b;\nconst multiply = (a, b) => a * b;\n\nconsole.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum)); // Output: 15\nconsole.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], multiply)); // Output: 120\n```\nI've written the code in JavaScript, using the syntax and conventions specified. The `reduce` function takes an array `arr` and a function `fn` as arguments, and returns the result of applying the reduction function to the elements of the array. The `sum` and `multiply` functions are simple examples of reduction functions that add or multiply two numbers, respectively. The `console.log` statements demonstrate the usage of the `reduce` function with these reduction functions.",
