  "answer": "**Coin Change Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. It uses a greedy algorithm to select the largest denomination coins first.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_change(amount, denominations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (int): The amount to make change for.\n        denominations (list): A list of available coin denominations.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed to make change.\n        dict: A dictionary mapping coin denominations to their respective counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the denominations in descending order\n    denominations.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize the coin count dictionary\n    coin_count = {denomination: 0 for denomination in denominations}\n\n    # Calculate the change\n    remaining_amount = amount\n    for denomination in denominations:\n        count = remaining_amount // denomination\n        if count > 0:\n            coin_count[denomination] = count\n            remaining_amount -= denomination * count\n\n    # Calculate the total number of coins\n    total_coins = sum(coin_count.values())\n\n    return total_coins, coin_count\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the available coin denominations\n    denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]  # quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n\n    # Get the amount from the user\n    amount = int(input(\"Enter the amount to make change for: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the change\n    total_coins, coin_count = calculate_change(amount, denominations)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Minimum number of coins needed: {total_coins}\")\n    print(\"Coin count:\")\n    for denomination, count in coin_count.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            print(f\"{denomination} cents: {count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\n1. Run the program and enter an amount to make change for (e.g., 37).\n2. The program will calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change and print the results.\n\n**Output**\n----------\n\n```\nEnter the amount to make change for: 37\nMinimum number of coins needed: 4\nCoin count:\n25 cents: 1\n10 cents: 1\n1 cents: 2\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple greedy algorithm for calculating the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. The `calculate_change` function takes an amount and a list of available coin denominations as input and returns the minimum number of coins needed to make change and a dictionary mapping coin denominations to their respective counts. The `main` function provides a simple example usage of the `calculate_change` function.",
