  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that performs basic boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT) using variables:\n\n```python\n# Define boolean variables\na = True\nb = False\n\n# Perform AND operation\nand_result = a and b\nprint(f\"a AND b: {and_result}\")\n\n# Perform OR operation\nor_result = a or b\nprint(f\"a OR b: {or_result}\")\n\n# Perform NOT operation\nnot_a = not a\nnot_b = not b\nprint(f\"NOT a: {not_a}\")\nprint(f\"NOT b: {not_b}\")\n\n# Perform more complex operations\ncomplex_and_result = (a and b) or (not a and not b)\nprint(f\"(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT b): {complex_and_result}\")\n\ncomplex_or_result = (a or b) and (not a or not b)\nprint(f\"(a OR b) AND (NOT a OR NOT b): {complex_or_result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define two boolean variables `a` and `b`, and then perform the AND, OR, and NOT operations using these variables. We also perform more complex operations, such as `(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT b)` and `(a OR b) AND (NOT a OR NOT b)`, to demonstrate how the operations can be combined.\n\nYou can modify the values of `a` and `b` to see how the results of the operations change.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `and` operator: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`, and `False` otherwise.\n* `or` operator: Returns `True` if either operand is `True`, and `False` otherwise.\n* `not` operator: Returns the opposite of the operand (i.e., `True` becomes `False`, and `False` becomes `True`).\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\na AND b: False\na OR b: True\nNOT a: False\nNOT b: True\n(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT b): False\n(a OR b) AND (NOT a OR NOT b): True\n```",
