  "prompt": "Write a function that checks if a given matrix is symmetric, i.e., equal to its transpose.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to check if a given matrix is symmetric, providing a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this functionality. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given matrix is symmetric.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): A 2D list representing the matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to ensure the input matrix is a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    matrix = np.array(matrix)\n\n    # Check if the input matrix is a 2D array\n    if len(matrix.shape) != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a 2D matrix\")\n\n    # Check if the matrix is square (i.e., it has the same number of rows and columns)\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False  # A non-square matrix cannot be symmetric\n\n    # Now, we can compare the matrix with its transpose\n    # We use numpy's built-in transpose function to get the transpose of the matrix\n    transpose = matrix.T\n\n    # Finally, we compare the matrix with its transpose\n    # If they are equal, the matrix is symmetric\n    return np.array_equal(matrix, transpose)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]]\nprint(is_symmetric(matrix))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_symmetric` first converts the input `matrix` into a numpy array for easier manipulation and checks if it's a 2D array. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n* It then checks if the matrix is square by comparing the number of rows and columns. If the matrix is not square, it immediately returns `False` because a non-square matrix cannot be symmetric.\n* The function uses numpy's built-in `transpose` function to get the transpose of the matrix and compares it with the original matrix using `np.array_equal`.\n* If the matrix and its transpose are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the matrix is symmetric; otherwise, it returns `False`.",
