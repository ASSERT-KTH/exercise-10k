  "answer": "**Demonstrating Constant Variables in Python**\n=====================================================\n\nHere's a Python program that showcases the use of constant variables.\n\n```python\n# Define constant variables\nPI = 3.14159  # Mathematical constant\nGRAVITY = 9.81  # m/s^2, acceleration due to gravity on Earth\nMAX_STUDENTS = 30  # Maximum number of students in a class\n\n# Function to calculate the area of a circle\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the area of a circle using the formula: area = \u03c0 * r^2\"\"\"\n    return PI * (radius ** 2)\n\n# Function to calculate the force of gravity on an object\ndef calculate_force(mass):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the force of gravity on an object using the formula: force = m * g\"\"\"\n    return mass * GRAVITY\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Constant Variables Demonstration\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n\n    # Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5\n    radius = 5\n    area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n    print(f\"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}\")\n\n    # Calculate the force of gravity on an object with mass 10 kg\n    mass = 10\n    force = calculate_force(mass)\n    print(f\"The force of gravity on an object with mass {mass} kg is {force:.2f} N\")\n\n    # Check if the number of students is within the maximum limit\n    num_students = 25\n    if num_students <= MAX_STUDENTS:\n        print(f\"The number of students ({num_students}) is within the maximum limit ({MAX_STUDENTS})\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The number of students ({num_students}) exceeds the maximum limit ({MAX_STUDENTS})\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nConstant Variables Demonstration\n----------------------------------\nThe area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.54\nThe force of gravity on an object with mass 10 kg is 98.10 N\nThe number of students (25) is within the maximum limit (30)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We define three constant variables: `PI`, `GRAVITY`, and `MAX_STUDENTS`.\n2. We create two functions: `calculate_circle_area` and `calculate_force`, which use the constant variables to perform calculations.\n3. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the use of these constant variables by calculating the area of a circle, the force of gravity on an object, and checking if the number of students is within the maximum limit.\n4. The output shows the results of these calculations and checks.\n\nNote: In Python, there is no strict enforcement of constant variables. However, by convention, we use uppercase letters to denote constant variables and avoid modifying them throughout the program.",
