  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the ASCII value of a given character using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the ASCII value of a given character using a while loop:\n\n```python\ndef print_ascii(char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the ASCII value of a given character.\n    \n    Args:\n        char (str): A single character.\n    \"\"\"\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(char):\n        print(f\"The ASCII value of '{char[i]}' is {ord(char[i])}\")\n        i += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nchar = input(\"Enter a character: \")\nprint_ascii(char)\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `print_ascii` that takes a character as input. Inside the function, we use a while loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, we use the built-in `ord` function to get its ASCII value and print it.\n\nHowever, since the problem statement asks for a single character, the program will only work correctly if the user enters a single character. If the user enters multiple characters, the program will print the ASCII value of each character.\n\nIf you want to ensure that the program only works with single characters, you can add a check at the beginning of the function:\n\n```python\ndef print_ascii(char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the ASCII value of a given character.\n    \n    Args:\n        char (str): A single character.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(char) != 1:\n        print(\"Error: Please enter a single character.\")\n        return\n    \n    print(f\"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ord(char)}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nchar = input(\"Enter a character: \")\nprint_ascii(char)\n```\n\nIn this version of the program, we check if the length of the input string is 1. If it's not, we print an error message and return from the function without printing the ASCII value.",
