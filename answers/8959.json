  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Printing\n\nBelow is an example code written in Python that demonstrates how to declare a variable, assign it a value, and then print out the value in a specific format.\n\n```python\n# Declare a variable and assign it a value\nvariable = 123.456\n\n# Print out the value in a specific format\nprint(f\"The value is: {variable:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We declare a variable named `variable` and assign it a floating-point value of `123.456`.\n*   We use the `print` function with an f-string to print out the value in the desired format.\n*   The `:.2f` format specifier is used to format the value as a floating-point number with two decimal places.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe value is: 123.46\n```\n\nYou can adjust the format specifier to achieve the desired output format. For example, `:.3f` would format the value with three decimal places.",
