  "answer": "**List Intersection Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two lists as input and returns their intersection, i.e., the elements that are common to both lists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the intersection of two lists.\n    \n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    intersection = list_intersection(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Intersection:\", intersection)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `list_intersection` function takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `list1`.\n3. For each element, it checks if the element is also present in `list2`.\n4. If an element is found in both lists, it is included in the resulting intersection list.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `list_intersection` with two example lists.\n\n### Alternative Solution using Sets\n\nIf you need to find the intersection of large lists, using sets can be more efficient:\n\n```python\ndef list_intersection_set(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the intersection of two lists using sets.\n    \n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list.\n        list2 (list): The second list.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: The intersection of list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main_set():\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    intersection = list_intersection_set(list1, list2)\n    print(\"Intersection (set):\", intersection)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_set()\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in the intersection list may not be preserved when using sets.",
