  "answer": "**Statistics Calculator Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given list of numbers.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport statistics\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the mean, median, and mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    mode = statistics.mode(numbers)\n\n    return mean, median, mode\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n    mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)\n\n    print(\"Mean:\", mean)\n    print(\"Median:\", median)\n    print(\"Mode:\", mode)\n\n    # Alternative way to calculate mode when there are multiple modes\n    counter = Counter(numbers)\n    modes = [num for num, count in counter.items() if count == max(counter.values())]\n    print(\"Modes (alternative method):\", modes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean, median, and mode using the `statistics` module.\n2. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_statistics` function with an example list of numbers.\n3. The program prints the calculated mean, median, and mode to the console.\n4. The alternative method to calculate the mode is also demonstrated, which uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number and finds the modes by finding the numbers with the maximum count.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* The `statistics.mode` function raises a `StatisticsError` if there is not exactly one most common value. To handle this, you can use the alternative method to calculate the mode, which returns all modes in case of a tie.\n* The `statistics` module is part of the Python Standard Library, so you don't need to install any external packages to use this program.",
