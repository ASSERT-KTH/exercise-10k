  "answer": "**Measuring Execution Time with a Decorator**\n=============================================\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of another function:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef timer_decorator(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.\n\n    Args:\n        func: The function to be measured.\n\n    Returns:\n        A wrapper function that measures the execution time of the input function.\n    \"\"\"\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        execution_time = end_time - start_time\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n@timer_decorator\ndef example_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    An example function that simulates some work.\n    \"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work\n\n# Test the example function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_function()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1.  The `timer_decorator` function takes another function `func` as an argument.\n2.  It defines a wrapper function that measures the execution time of `func`.\n3.  The `wraps` decorator from the `functools` module is used to preserve the metadata (e.g., name, docstring) of the original function.\n4.  The wrapper function records the start time, calls the original function, records the end time, and calculates the execution time.\n5.  The execution time is printed to the console.\n6.  The result of the original function is returned by the wrapper function.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\nWhen you run the `example_function`, you'll see an output similar to this:\n\n```\nFunction example_function executed in 1.0011 seconds.\n```\n\nThis indicates that the `example_function` took approximately 1.0011 seconds to execute.",
