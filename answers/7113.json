  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a dictionary to store student grades. The program should prompt the user for a student's name and their grades in three subjects: math, science, and English. The grades should be stored in a dictionary where the keys are the student's name and the values are another dictionary with the subject as the key and the grade as the value. The program should then print out the student's grades in a formatted manner.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specifications:\n\n```python\n# Create an empty dictionary to store student grades\nstudent_grades = {}\n\n# Prompt the user for the student's name\ns_name = input(\"Enter student name: \")\n\n# Create a dictionary for the student's grades\nstudent_grades[s_name] = {}\n\n# Prompt the user for the student's grades in math, science, and English\nmath_grade = input(\"Enter math grade: \")\nscience_grade = input(\"Enter science grade: \")\nenglish_grade = input(\"Enter English grade: \")\n\n# Store the grades in the student's dictionary\nstudent_grades[s_name] = {\"math\": math_grade, \"science\": science_grade, \"english\": english_grade}\n\n# Print the student's grades in a formatted manner\nprint(f\"Student Name: {s_name}\")\nprint(f\"Math Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['math']}\")\nprint(f\"Science Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['science']}\")\nprint(f\"English Grade: {student_grades[s_name]['english']}\")\n\n# Note: This program does not store grades for multiple students. To do so, you would need to create a loop that prompts the user for multiple students' names and grades, and stores each student's grades in the dictionary with their name as the key.\n```\n\nThis code matches the provided specifications and demonstrates how to store and print student grades using a dictionary. Note that this is a simple example and does not store grades for multiple students. To do so, you would need to create a loop that prompts the user for multiple students' names and grades, and stores each student's grades in the dictionary with their name as the key.",
