  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that compares two numbers using variables and prints out the result of the comparison:\n\n```python\n# Define two variables with numbers\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 20\n\n# Compare the numbers and print the result\nif num1 > num2:\n    print(f\"{num1} is greater than {num2}\")\nelif num1 < num2:\n    print(f\"{num1} is less than {num2}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{num1} is equal to {num2}\")\n\n# You can also use comparison operators to store the result in a variable\nresult = num1 > num2\nprint(f\"Is {num1} greater than {num2}? {result}\")\n\nresult = num1 < num2\nprint(f\"Is {num1} less than {num2}? {result}\")\n\nresult = num1 == num2\nprint(f\"Is {num1} equal to {num2}? {result}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will compare `num1` (10) and `num2` (20) and print out the result of the comparison. It will also compare the numbers using comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) and store the result in a variable, then print out the result.\n\nExample output:\n```\n10 is less than 20\nIs 10 greater than 20? False\nIs 10 less than 20? True\nIs 10 equal to 20? False\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to compare two numbers using variables and print out the result of the comparison in Python.",
