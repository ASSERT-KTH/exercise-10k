  "answer": "**BMI Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height, and then prints the corresponding weight status.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the BMI of a person.\n\n    Args:\n        weight (float): Weight in kg.\n        height (float): Height in meters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: BMI value.\n    \"\"\"\n    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)\n    return bmi\n\ndef get_weight_status(bmi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the weight status based on the BMI.\n\n    Args:\n        bmi (float): BMI value.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Weight status.\n    \"\"\"\n    if bmi < 18.5:\n        return \"Underweight\"\n    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n        return \"Normal\"\n    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n        return \"Overweight\"\n    else:\n        return \"Obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    weight = float(input(\"Enter your weight in kg: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n\n    # Calculate BMI\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\n\n    # Determine weight status\n    weight_status = get_weight_status(bmi)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(f\"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Your weight status is: {weight_status}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your weight in kg when prompted.\n3. Enter your height in meters when prompted.\n4. The program will calculate and print your BMI and weight status.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses the World Health Organization's (WHO) BMI categories:\n\n* Underweight: BMI < 18.5\n* Normal: 18.5 <= BMI < 25\n* Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30\n* Obese: BMI >= 30\n\nPlease keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure, and other factors like muscle mass and body composition should also be considered when evaluating a person's health.",
