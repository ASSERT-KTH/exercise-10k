  "answer": "**Tax Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the tax amount based on the income using conditional statements. The tax rates are as follows:\n\n* 0% tax on income up to $10,000\n* 10% tax on income between $10,001 and $20,000\n* 20% tax on income between $20,001 and $50,000\n* 30% tax on income above $50,000\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tax amount based on the income.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The income amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The tax amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    if income <= 10000:\n        # 0% tax on income up to $10,000\n        tax = 0\n    elif income <= 20000:\n        # 10% tax on income between $10,001 and $20,000\n        tax = (income - 10000) * 0.10\n    elif income <= 50000:\n        # 20% tax on income between $20,001 and $50,000\n        tax = (income - 20000) * 0.20 + 1000\n    else:\n        # 30% tax on income above $50,000\n        tax = (income - 50000) * 0.30 + 7000\n\n    return tax\n\ndef main():\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your income: $\"))\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    print(f\"Your tax amount is: ${tax:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_tax` function takes the income as an argument and calculates the tax amount based on the income.\n2. The function uses conditional statements to determine the tax rate based on the income.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their income, calls the `calculate_tax` function, and prints the tax amount.\n4. The tax amount is formatted to display two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter an income of $15,000: The tax amount will be $500.00.\n* Enter an income of $30,000: The tax amount will be $2,000.00.\n* Enter an income of $60,000: The tax amount will be $7,000.00.",
