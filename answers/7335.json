  "answer": "**Database Reader Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program reads input from a SQLite database and prints out the contents.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n---------------\n\n* Python 3.x installed on your system\n* `sqlite3` library installed (comes pre-installed with Python)\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef read_database(db_name, table_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads input from a SQLite database and prints out the contents.\n\n    Args:\n        db_name (str): Name of the database file\n        table_name (str): Name of the table to read from\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Connect to the database\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n        # Read data from the table\n        cursor.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM {table_name}\")\n\n        # Fetch all rows from the table\n        rows = cursor.fetchall()\n\n        # Print the column names\n        column_names = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]\n        print(\"Column Names:\")\n        print(column_names)\n\n        # Print the data\n        print(\"\\nData:\")\n        for row in rows:\n            print(row)\n\n    except sqlite3.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n    finally:\n        # Close the connection\n        if conn:\n            conn.close()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    db_name = \"example.db\"\n    table_name = \"users\"\n    read_database(db_name, table_name)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The program uses the `sqlite3` library to connect to a SQLite database.\n2. The `read_database` function takes two arguments: `db_name` (the name of the database file) and `table_name` (the name of the table to read from).\n3. The function connects to the database, reads data from the specified table, and prints out the column names and data.\n4. The program includes error handling to catch any SQLite-related errors.\n5. The example usage shows how to call the `read_database` function with a sample database and table name.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* Make sure to replace `example.db` and `users` with your actual database and table names.\n* This program assumes that the database file is in the same directory as the script. If the database file is in a different directory, you'll need to specify the full path to the file.\n* This program prints out all columns and rows from the specified table. If you want to filter the data or select specific columns, you'll need to modify the SQL query accordingly.",
