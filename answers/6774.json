  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a dictionary as input where the keys are names of students and the values are lists of their scores in different subjects. The program should calculate the average score for each student and return a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average scores as values.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a program that calculates the average score for each student in a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average scores as values. This will help you understand how to process and summarize student score data effectively. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_scores(student_scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average score for each student in a dictionary.\n    \n    Args:\n        student_scores (dict): A dictionary where keys are names of students and values are lists of their scores in different subjects.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the student names as keys and their average scores as values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average scores of students\n    average_scores = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, scores in student_scores.items():\n        # Check if the list of scores is not empty to avoid division by zero error\n        if len(scores) > 0:\n            # Calculate the sum of scores for the current student\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            \n            # Calculate the average score by dividing the total score by the number of scores\n            average_score = total_score / len(scores)\n            \n            # Store the average score in the average_scores dictionary\n            average_scores[student] = average_score\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with average scores\n    return average_scores\n\n# Example usage:\nstudent_scores = {\n    'Alice': [90, 85, 95],\n    'Bob': [80, 75, 85],\n    'Charlie': [95, 90, 92]\n}\n\naverage_scores = calculate_average_scores(student_scores)\nprint(average_scores)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average_scores` function initializes an empty dictionary `average_scores` to store the average scores of students. It then iterates over each student in the input dictionary `student_scores`.\n*   For each student, it calculates the sum of scores using the `sum` function and then computes the average score by dividing the total score by the number of scores. The average score is stored in the `average_scores` dictionary.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `average_scores` dictionary, which contains the student names as keys and their average scores as values.\n*   The example usage demonstrates how to call the `calculate_average_scores` function with a sample `student_scores` dictionary and print the resulting `average_scores` dictionary.",
