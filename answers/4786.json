  "prompt": "Write a program that asks the user for two strings and then prints out their concatenation.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you described:\n\n```python\n# Ask the user for two strings\nstr1 = input(\"Enter the first string: \")\nstr2 = input(\"Enter the second string: \")\n\n# Concatenate the strings\nconcatenated_str = str1 + str2\n\n# Print the concatenated string\nprint(\"The concatenation of the two strings is: \", concatenated_str)\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. When prompted, enter the first string (e.g., \"Hello\").\n3. When prompted again, enter the second string (e.g., \"World\").\n4. The program will print the concatenation of the two strings (e.g., \"HelloWorld\").\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get user input. It returns a string by default.\n2. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two strings.\n3. The `print()` function is used to print the concatenated string.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program does not perform any error checking. If you want to add error checking (e.g., to ensure the user enters a string), you can use a `try-except` block.\n* The program concatenates the strings without adding any separator (e.g., a space). If you want to add a separator, you can modify the concatenation line to something like `concatenated_str = str1 + \" \" + str2`.",
