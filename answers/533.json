  "answer": "**Nearest Neighbor Function**\n=====================================\n\nThe following function finds the nearest neighbor to a query point in a set of points. It uses the Euclidean distance metric to calculate the distance between points.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nearest_neighbor(query_point, points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the nearest neighbor to a query point in a set of points.\n\n    Args:\n    - query_point (numpy array): The point for which to find the nearest neighbor.\n    - points (numpy array): The set of points.\n\n    Returns:\n    - nearest_point (numpy array): The nearest point to the query point.\n    - distance (float): The Euclidean distance between the query point and its nearest neighbor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the Euclidean distance between the query point and all points\n    distances = np.linalg.norm(points - query_point, axis=1)\n\n    # Find the index of the point with the minimum distance\n    nearest_index = np.argmin(distances)\n\n    # Get the nearest point and its distance\n    nearest_point = points[nearest_index]\n    distance = distances[nearest_index]\n\n    return nearest_point, distance\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a set of points\n    points = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n\n    # Define a query point\n    query_point = np.array([2, 3])\n\n    # Find the nearest neighbor\n    nearest_point, distance = nearest_neighbor(query_point, points)\n\n    print(\"Nearest point:\", nearest_point)\n    print(\"Distance:\", distance)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The function takes two inputs: `query_point` and `points`. `query_point` is the point for which to find the nearest neighbor, and `points` is the set of points.\n2. It calculates the Euclidean distance between `query_point` and all points in `points` using `np.linalg.norm`.\n3. It finds the index of the point with the minimum distance using `np.argmin`.\n4. It returns the nearest point and its distance.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of points. This is because it needs to calculate the distance between the query point and all points. For large datasets, a more efficient algorithm like k-d trees or ball trees can be used to reduce the time complexity to O(log n).",
