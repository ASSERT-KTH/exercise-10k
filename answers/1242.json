  "answer": "### Rectangle Area Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following is a Python function named `calculate_rectangle_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of a rectangle.\n\n    Args:\n        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if length < 0 or width < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length and width cannot be negative\")\n\n    area = length * width\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    length = 5.0\n    width = 3.0\n    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   This function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, both of type `float`.\n*   It checks if either the length or the width is negative and raises a `ValueError` if true, as a rectangle cannot have negative dimensions.\n*   The area is calculated by multiplying the length and the width.\n*   The result is returned as a `float` value.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use this function with a length of 5.0 and a width of 3.0, then print the calculated area.",
