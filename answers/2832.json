  "answer": "**Date to Day of the Week Program**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to determine the day of the week based on a given date.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_day_of_week(year, month, day):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the day of the week based on the date using Zeller's Congruence algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year of the date.\n        month (int): The month of the date (1-12).\n        day (int): The day of the date (1-31).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    if month < 3:\n        month += 12\n        year -= 1\n\n    q = day\n    m = month\n    k = year % 100\n    j = year // 100\n\n    f = q + ((13 * (m + 1)) // 5) + k + (k // 4) + (j // 4) - (2 * j)\n    result = f % 7\n\n    days = [\"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    return days[result]\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year: \"))\n    month = int(input(\"Enter the month (1-12): \"))\n    day = int(input(\"Enter the day (1-31): \"))\n\n    day_of_week = find_day_of_week(year, month, day)\n    print(f\"The day of the week for {month}/{day}/{year} is {day_of_week}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_day_of_week` function takes in the year, month, and day as arguments and returns the corresponding day of the week.\n2. The function first adjusts the month and year if the month is January or February, as Zeller's Congruence algorithm requires this adjustment.\n3. The function then calculates the day of the week using the formula: `f = q + ((13 * (m + 1)) // 5) + k + (k // 4) + (j // 4) - (2 * j)`, where `q` is the day, `m` is the month, `k` is the year modulo 100, and `j` is the year divided by 100.\n4. The result is then taken modulo 7 to get the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, etc.).\n5. The `main` function prompts the user for a date and then calls the `find_day_of_week` function to calculate and print the day of the week.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a specific date, such as 12/25/2022, to find the day of the week (Monday).\n* Enter a different date, such as 7/4/1776, to find the day of the week (Thursday).",
