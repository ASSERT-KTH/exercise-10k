  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Initialization\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that declares and initializes variables of different data types to store a person's name, age, and height:\n\n```python\n# Declare and initialize variables\nname: str = \"John Doe\"  # String data type\nage: int = 30  # Integer data type\nheight: float = 1.75  # Float data type\n\n# Print the variables\nprint(\"Name:\", name)\nprint(\"Age:\", age)\nprint(\"Height (in meters):\", height)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We declare and initialize variables `name`, `age`, and `height` using type hints for `str`, `int`, and `float` data types, respectively.\n*   We assign values to these variables: a string for the name, an integer for the age, and a float for the height.\n*   Finally, we print the values of these variables to the console.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   **String (`str`)**: Used to store text data, such as a person's name.\n*   **Integer (`int`)**: Used to store whole numbers, such as a person's age.\n*   **Float (`float`)**: Used to store decimal numbers, such as a person's height.\n\nYou can modify the values of these variables as needed to store different information.",
