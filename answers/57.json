  "answer": "**Maximum Repeating Character in a String**\n\nTo find the maximum repeating character in a string, you can use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character. Then, you can find the character with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each character.\n2. Iterate through the string and update the frequency of each character in the dictionary.\n3. Find the character with the maximum frequency.\n4. Return the character with the maximum frequency.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef max_repeating_char(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the maximum repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The maximum repeating character.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return None\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    char_freq = {}\n\n    # Iterate through the string and update the frequency of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_freq:\n            char_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_freq[char] = 1\n\n    # Find the character with the maximum frequency\n    max_char = max(char_freq, key=char_freq.get)\n\n    return max_char\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"aabbbcccc\"\nmax_char = max_repeating_char(s)\nprint(f\"The maximum repeating character is: {max_char}\")\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once to update the frequency of each character.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character, and in the worst case, the dictionary can store n characters.",
