  "answer": "**Image Filter Program**\n=======================\n\nThis program takes an image as input and applies a filter or effect to it. The program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to read and manipulate the image.\n\n**Requirements**\n---------------\n\n* Python 3.x\n* PIL (Python Imaging Library)\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter\nimport os\n\ndef apply_filter(image_path, filter_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a filter to the image.\n\n    Args:\n        image_path (str): Path to the image file.\n        filter_type (str): Type of filter to apply. Can be one of the following:\n            - 'grayscale'\n            - 'blur'\n            - 'sharpen'\n            - 'brightness'\n            - 'contrast'\n\n    Returns:\n        Image: The filtered image.\n    \"\"\"\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n\n    if filter_type == 'grayscale':\n        # Convert image to grayscale\n        image = image.convert('L')\n    elif filter_type == 'blur':\n        # Apply blur filter\n        image = image.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=5))\n    elif filter_type == 'sharpen':\n        # Apply sharpen filter\n        enhancer = ImageEnhance.Sharpness(image)\n        image = enhancer.enhance(1.5)\n    elif filter_type == 'brightness':\n        # Adjust brightness\n        enhancer = ImageEnhance.Brightness(image)\n        image = enhancer.enhance(1.5)\n    elif filter_type == 'contrast':\n        # Adjust contrast\n        enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(image)\n        image = enhancer.enhance(1.5)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid filter type. Please choose from the following: 'grayscale', 'blur', 'sharpen', 'brightness', 'contrast'\")\n\n    return image\n\ndef main():\n    image_path = input(\"Enter the path to the image file: \")\n    filter_type = input(\"Enter the type of filter to apply (grayscale, blur, sharpen, brightness, contrast): \")\n\n    filtered_image = apply_filter(image_path, filter_type)\n\n    # Save the filtered image\n    output_path = os.path.splitext(image_path)[0] + '_filtered' + os.path.splitext(image_path)[1]\n    filtered_image.save(output_path)\n\n    print(\"Filtered image saved to:\", output_path)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Usage**\n-----\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `image_filter.py`.\n2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pillow` in your terminal.\n3. Run the program by executing `python image_filter.py` in your terminal.\n4. Enter the path to the image file when prompted.\n5. Enter the type of filter to apply when prompted.\n6. The filtered image will be saved to a new file with the same name as the original image but with a `_filtered` suffix.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Applying a grayscale filter to an image: `python image_filter.py` and enter `grayscale` when prompted.\n* Applying a blur filter to an image: `python image_filter.py` and enter `blur` when prompted.\n* Adjusting the brightness of an image: `python image_filter.py` and enter `brightness` when prompted.",
