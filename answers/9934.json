  "prompt": "Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reversed array. The function should not use any built-in reverse functions.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef reverse(arr):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        temp = arr[left]\n        arr[left] = arr[right]\n        arr[right] = temp\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return arr\n\narr = [4, 5, 1, 2]\nprint(reverse(arr))\n```\nThis code defines a function `reverse` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reversed array. It uses a simple iterative approach to swap elements from the beginning and end of the array, working its way towards the middle. The function does not use any built-in reverse functions or data structures, as required.",
