  "prompt": "Create a program that validates bank transactions based on the account balance and transaction amount. The program should take two parameters: the current account balance and the transaction amount. If the transaction amount is greater than the account balance, the program should print 'Insufficient funds'. If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the program should print 'Transaction successful' and update the account balance by subtracting the transaction amount.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef validate_transaction(balance, transaction_amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates bank transactions based on the account balance and transaction amount.\n\n    Args:\n        balance (float): The current account balance.\n        transaction_amount (float): The transaction amount.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The updated account balance if the transaction is successful, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the transaction amount is greater than the account balance\n    if transaction_amount > balance:\n        # If true, print 'Insufficient funds'\n        print('Insufficient funds')\n        return None\n    \n    # If the transaction amount is less than or equal to the account balance\n    else:\n        # Print 'Transaction successful'\n        print('Transaction successful')\n        \n        # Update the account balance by subtracting the transaction amount\n        updated_balance = balance - transaction_amount\n        \n        # Return the updated account balance\n        return updated_balance\n\n\n# Example usage:\nbalance = 1000.0\ntransaction_amount = 500.0\n\nupdated_balance = validate_transaction(balance, transaction_amount)\n\nif updated_balance is not None:\n    print(f'Updated account balance: {updated_balance}')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `validate_transaction` function takes two parameters: `balance` and `transaction_amount`, representing the current account balance and the transaction amount, respectively.\n*   It checks if the `transaction_amount` is greater than the `balance`. If true, it prints 'Insufficient funds' and returns `None`.\n*   If the `transaction_amount` is less than or equal to the `balance`, it prints 'Transaction successful', updates the `balance` by subtracting the `transaction_amount`, and returns the updated `balance`.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to call the `validate_transaction` function with a sample `balance` and `transaction_amount`, and print the updated account balance if the transaction is successful.",
