  "answer": "**Series Sum Function**\n=======================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the sum of a series of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef series_sum(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of a series of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of the series.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = series_sum(numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of the series is:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `series_sum` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.\n*   The result is returned as a float.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Calculating the sum of a list of integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n*   Calculating the sum of a list of floating-point numbers: `[1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]`\n*   Calculating the sum of a list of mixed numbers: `[1, 2.2, 3, 4.4, 5]`\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Make sure to pass a list of numbers to the `series_sum` function.\n*   The function will return a float, even if the input list contains only integers.\n*   You can use this function as a building block for more complex calculations, such as calculating the average or standard deviation of a series.",
