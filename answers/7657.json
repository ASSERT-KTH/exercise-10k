  "answer": "**Standard Deviation Function**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The list cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Calculate the mean of the list\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the variance of the list\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the list\n    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n    return standard_deviation\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis function works by first calculating the mean of the list, then calculating the variance, and finally calculating the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n\n**Note**\n----\n\nThis function calculates the population standard deviation. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation, you should divide by `len(numbers) - 1` when calculating the variance.\n\n**Alternative Solution**\n-----------------------\n\nYou can also use the `numpy` library to calculate the standard deviation, which is more efficient and accurate:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    return np.std(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))\n```\n\nThis solution is more concise and efficient, but it requires the `numpy` library to be installed.",
