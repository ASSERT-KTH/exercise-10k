  "answer": "**Reading URL Contents**\n==========================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that reads input from a URL and prints out the contents.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef read_url_contents(url):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads the contents of a URL and prints it out.\n\n    Args:\n        url (str): The URL to read from.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        # Check if the request was successful\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            # Print the contents of the URL\n            print(response.text)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve contents. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = input(\"Enter a URL: \")\n    read_url_contents(url)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n-----------------\n\n1. The `requests` library is used to send a GET request to the specified URL.\n2. The `response` object is checked for a successful status code (200).\n3. If the request is successful, the contents of the URL are printed out using `response.text`.\n4. If an error occurs during the request, an error message is printed out.\n\n**Running the Program**\n-------------------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `read_url_contents.py`.\n2. Install the `requests` library by running `pip install requests` in your terminal.\n3. Run the program by executing `python read_url_contents.py` in your terminal.\n4. Enter a URL when prompted to read its contents.",
