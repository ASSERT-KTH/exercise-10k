  "answer": "**Student Grade Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks a student's grade and prints out a message based on their score using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef check_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks a student's grade and prints out a message based on their score.\n    \n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        print(\"Grade: A. Excellent job! Your score is\", score)\n    elif score >= 80:\n        print(\"Grade: B. Good job! Your score is\", score)\n    elif score >= 70:\n        print(\"Grade: C. Fair job! Your score is\", score)\n    elif score >= 60:\n        print(\"Grade: D. Needs improvement! Your score is\", score)\n    else:\n        print(\"Grade: F. Failed! Your score is\", score)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n    \n    # Check the grade\n    check_grade(score)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the student's score is 95, the program will print: `Grade: A. Excellent job! Your score is 95.0`\n* If the student's score is 82, the program will print: `Grade: B. Good job! Your score is 82.0`\n* If the student's score is 68, the program will print: `Grade: D. Needs improvement! Your score is 68.0`\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `check_grade` function takes a score as input and checks it against a series of if/else statements.\n2. Each if/else statement checks if the score is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (e.g., 90, 80, 70, etc.).\n3. If the score meets the threshold, the function prints out a message indicating the grade and the score.\n4. The `main` function gets the student's score from the user and calls the `check_grade` function to check the grade.",
