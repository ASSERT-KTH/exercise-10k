  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the ASCII values of characters in a given string using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int i;\n    char str[] = \"C Programming\";\n\n    for (i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        printf(\"ASCII value of character '%c' is %d\\n\", str[i], str[i]);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI've carefully followed the specification and included all the required elements:\n\n* Included the `stdio.h` header file\n* Defined the `main` function as the entry point\n* Declared an integer variable `i` and a character array `str` with the string \"C Programming\"\n* Used a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the string\n* Inside the loop, printed the ASCII value of each character using `printf`\n* Returned an integer value (0) to indicate successful execution\n\nThis code should print the ASCII values of each character in the string \"C Programming\", as specified.",
