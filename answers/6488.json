  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and then asks the user to guess the number. After each guess, it prints out a hint, such as 'too high' or 'too low', to help the user narrow down the correct answer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_random_number(min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"Generate a random number between min_value and max_value\"\"\"\n    return random.randint(min_value, max_value)\n\ndef get_user_guess(min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"Get the user's guess and validate the input\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Guess a number between {min_value} and {max_value}: \"))\n            if min_value <= guess <= max_value:\n                return guess\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number within the specified range.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\ndef play_game(min_value, max_value):\n    \"\"\"Play the random number guessing game\"\"\"\n    number_to_guess = get_random_number(min_value, max_value)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while True:\n        user_guess = get_user_guess(min_value, max_value)\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n\ndef main():\n    min_value = 1\n    max_value = 10\n    play_game(min_value, max_value)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 10 and prompt the user to guess the number.\n3. Enter a whole number within the specified range.\n4. The program will print out a hint, such as 'too high' or 'too low', to help the user narrow down the correct answer.\n5. Continue guessing until the correct number is found.\n6. The program will congratulate the user and display the number of attempts it took to find the correct answer.\n\nNote: This program uses the `random` module to generate a random number and the `input` function to get user input. It also includes error handling to ensure that the user enters a valid whole number within the specified range.",
