  "answer": "**Color Preference Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their favorite color and then prints a message saying they like that color.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_favorite_color():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user for their favorite color\"\"\"\n    favorite_color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n    return favorite_color\n\ndef print_color_preference(favorite_color):\n    \"\"\"Prints a message saying the user likes their favorite color\"\"\"\n    print(f\"You like {favorite_color}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    favorite_color = get_favorite_color()\n    print_color_preference(favorite_color)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `get_favorite_color` function asks the user for their favorite color using the `input` function.\n2. The `print_color_preference` function takes the favorite color as an argument and prints a message saying the user likes that color.\n3. The `main` function calls `get_favorite_color` to get the user's favorite color and then calls `print_color_preference` to print the message.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you for your favorite color. If you enter \"blue\", it will print:\n\n```\nYou like blue!\n```",
