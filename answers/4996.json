  "answer": "**Null vs Undefined Variables**\n=====================================\n\nIn programming, `null` and `undefined` are two distinct concepts that can sometimes be confusing. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for effective coding and debugging.\n\n**Null**\n--------\n\n* `null` represents the absence of a value or a reference to an object that does not exist.\n* It is a primitive value that can be assigned to a variable.\n* `null` is often used to indicate that a variable or property has no value or is empty.\n* In most programming languages, `null` is a keyword or a literal value.\n\n**Undefined**\n-------------\n\n* `undefined` represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable, property, or function.\n* It is a type that indicates that a variable or property has not been declared or initialized.\n* `undefined` is often used to indicate that a variable or property does not have a value or is not accessible.\n* In most programming languages, `undefined` is a type or a value that is returned when a variable or property is not defined.\n\n**Key Differences**\n-------------------\n\nHere are the key differences between `null` and `undefined`:\n\n* **Assignment**: `null` is a value that can be assigned to a variable, while `undefined` is a type that indicates that a variable is not defined.\n* **Existence**: `null` indicates that a variable or property exists but has no value, while `undefined` indicates that a variable or property does not exist or is not accessible.\n* **Type**: `null` is a primitive value, while `undefined` is a type that indicates that a variable or property is not defined.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\nHere are some example use cases to illustrate the difference between `null` and `undefined`:\n\n```javascript\n// Null example\nlet name = null; // name is defined but has no value\nconsole.log(name); // Output: null\n\n// Undefined example\nlet age; // age is not defined or initialized\nconsole.log(age); // Output: undefined\n\n// Example of accessing a non-existent property\nlet person = { name: 'John' };\nconsole.log(person.age); // Output: undefined\n```\n\nIn summary, `null` represents the absence of a value, while `undefined` represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable, property, or function. Understanding the difference between these two concepts is essential for effective coding and debugging in programming languages.",
