  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the following pattern: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... , n. The pattern should stop when the last number printed is greater than or equal to the input number n. Use a loop to generate the pattern.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nn = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\ni = 1\nwhile i <= n:\n    print(i)\n    i += 2\n```\nThis code reads an integer input from the user, initializes a loop counter `i` to 1, and enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Inside the loop, it prints the current value of `i` and increments `i` by 2.",
