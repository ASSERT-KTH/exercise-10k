  "answer": "**Selection Sort Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses nested for loops to sort a list using the selection sort algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of unsorted array\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n\n    return arr\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    sorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The outer loop (`for i in range(len(arr))`) iterates over each element in the array.\n2. The inner loop (`for j in range(i+1, len(arr))`) finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\n3. Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the first element of the unsorted array.\n4. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it less efficient for large datasets compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. However, it has the advantage of minimizing the number of swaps, which can be beneficial in certain scenarios.",
