  "answer": "**Matrix Multiplication Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two matrices as input and returns their product. It uses the standard matrix multiplication algorithm, which is based on the dot product of rows and columns.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef matrix_multiply(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the product of two matrices A and B.\n\n    Args:\n        A (np.ndarray): The first matrix.\n        B (np.ndarray): The second matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The product of A and B.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the number of columns in A is not equal to the number of rows in B.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrices can be multiplied\n    if A.shape[1] != B.shape[0]:\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of columns in A must be equal to the number of rows in B\")\n\n    # Use NumPy's built-in matrix multiplication function\n    return np.matmul(A, B)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define two example matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n    B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n\n    # Compute the product of A and B\n    product = matrix_multiply(A, B)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"Matrix A:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"Matrix B:\")\n    print(B)\n    print(\"Product of A and B:\")\n    print(product)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `matrix_multiply` function takes two matrices `A` and `B` as input and returns their product.\n2. It first checks if the number of columns in `A` is equal to the number of rows in `B`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It then uses NumPy's built-in `matmul` function to compute the product of `A` and `B`.\n4. In the example usage, we define two example matrices `A` and `B` and compute their product using the `matrix_multiply` function.\n5. Finally, we print the result.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program assumes that the input matrices are NumPy arrays. If the input matrices are not NumPy arrays, you may need to convert them to NumPy arrays before using this program.",
