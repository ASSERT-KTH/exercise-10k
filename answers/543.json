  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that uses the built-in `find()` method of Python strings:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(string, substring):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.\n    \n    Args:\n    string (str): The input string.\n    substring (str): The substring to search for.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the first occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    return string.find(substring)\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"Hello, World!\"\nsubstring = \"World\"\nindex = find_substring(string, substring)\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"The substring '{substring}' is found at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The substring '{substring}' is not found in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `find_substring` function takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.\n- The `find()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1.\n- The example usage demonstrates how to use the `find_substring` function to find the index of a substring in a string. If the substring is found, it prints the index; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the substring is not found.",
