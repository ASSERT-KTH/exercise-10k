  "answer": "### Filtering a List of Numbers using Lambda Expression\n\nHere's an example of a Python function that uses a lambda expression to filter a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef filter_numbers(numbers, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list of numbers based on a given condition.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes a number and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers that satisfy the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(filter(condition, numbers))\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Define a list of numbers\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    # Use a lambda expression to filter even numbers\n    even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\n\n    # Print the filtered list\n    print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n\n    # Use a lambda expression to filter numbers greater than 5\n    numbers_greater_than_5 = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)\n\n    # Print the filtered list\n    print(\"Numbers greater than 5:\", numbers_greater_than_5)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `filter_numbers` function takes a list of numbers and a condition as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `filter` function with the provided condition to filter the list of numbers.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `filter_numbers` with two different conditions:\n   * Filtering even numbers using a lambda expression `lambda x: x % 2 == 0`.\n   * Filtering numbers greater than 5 using a lambda expression `lambda x: x > 5`.\n4. The filtered lists are printed to the console.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\nEven numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nNumbers greater than 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```",
