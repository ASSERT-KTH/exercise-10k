  "prompt": "Create a program that stores student grades in a dictionary. The dictionary should have student names as keys and a list of their grades as values. The program should prompt the user to input a student's name and their grades for a certain number of assignments. It should then calculate the average grade for each student and print out the student's name, grades, and average grade.",

It stores the grades in a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are lists of grades.\n*   The `calculate_average_grades` function calculates the average grade for each student by summing up their grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n*   The `print_student_grades` function prints out the student's name, grades, and average grade.\n*   The `main` function calls the above functions in order to get the student grades, calculate the average grades, and print out the results.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of students, each student's name, and their grades. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the number of students: 2\nEnter the student's name: John\nEnter the number of assignments for John: 3\nEnter grade for assignment 1: 90\nEnter grade for assignment 2: 80\nEnter grade for assignment 3: 95\nEnter the student's name: Jane\nEnter the number of assignments for Jane: 3\nEnter grade for assignment 1: 85\nEnter grade for assignment 2: 90\nEnter grade for assignment 3: 92\n```\n\nAfter entering the grades, the program will print out the student's name, grades, and average grade:\n\n```\nStudent: John\nGrades: [90.0, 80.0, 95.0]\nAverage Grade: 88.33\n\nStudent: Jane\nGrades: [85.0, 90.0, 92.0]\nAverage Grade: 89.00\n```",
