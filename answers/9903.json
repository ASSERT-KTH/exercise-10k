  "answer": "**Coin Change Problem Solution**\n=====================================\n\nThis program uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. The coins available are assumed to be of denominations 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents, but this can be easily modified to accommodate other denominations.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        coins (list): List of coin denominations.\n        amount (int): Amount to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: Minimum number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed for amount 0\n\n    # Fill the table using dynamic programming\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If no solution is found, return -1\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    coins = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50]  # Available coin denominations\n    amount = 37  # Amount to make change for\n\n    min_coins_needed = min_coins(coins, amount)\n    if min_coins_needed != -1:\n        print(f\"Minimum coins needed: {min_coins_needed}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `min_coins` function takes two arguments: `coins` (a list of available coin denominations) and `amount` (the amount to make change for).\n2.  A table `dp` of size `amount + 1` is created to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to `amount`. The table is initialized with infinite values, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 (since 0 coins are needed for amount 0).\n3.  The table is filled using dynamic programming. For each coin denomination, the table is updated by checking if using the current coin can reduce the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.\n4.  Finally, the minimum number of coins needed for the given `amount` is returned. If no solution is found (i.e., the minimum number of coins is still infinite), -1 is returned.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for $0.37 using coins of denominations 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents.\n*   Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a custom set of coin denominations.",
