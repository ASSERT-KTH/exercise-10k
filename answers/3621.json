  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers in a list.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)\n    return even_sum\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)\n    print(\"Sum of even numbers:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and select only the even numbers (i.e., numbers for which `num % 2 == 0`).\n3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the selected even numbers.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `sum_even_numbers` with an example list.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the sum of even numbers in a list: `sum_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`\n* Calculate the sum of even numbers in a list with only odd numbers: `sum_even_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7])`\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list may contain non-integer values, additional error handling should be implemented.",
