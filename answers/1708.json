  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer until they choose to quit. The program uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input and determine the winner of each game.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Returns the winner of the game.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'tie'\n    if (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n       (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n        return 'user'\n    return 'computer'\n\ndef main():\n    play_again = 'y'\n    while play_again.lower() == 'y':\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid input. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n        \n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'tie':\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'user':\n            print(\"You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Computer wins!\")\n        \n        play_again = input(\"\\nPlay again? (y/n): \")\n        while play_again.lower() not in ['y', 'n']:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Play again? (y/n): \")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. Run the program and enter 'rock' when prompted. The computer will generate a random choice and determine the winner.\n2. Enter an invalid choice (e.g., 'abc') and the program will prompt you to enter a valid choice.\n3. Choose to play again by entering 'y' when prompted, or quit by entering 'n'.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The `get_computer_choice` function returns the computer's random choice.\n* The `determine_winner` function determines the winner of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.\n* The `main` function contains the game loop, which prompts the user for input, determines the winner, and asks if the user wants to play again.",
