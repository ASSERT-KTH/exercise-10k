  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a decimal number from the user and prints out its binary representation.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that reads a decimal number from the user and prints out its binary representation:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary():\n    decimal_num = int(input(\"Enter a decimal number: \"))\n    binary_num = bin(decimal_num)[2:]  # Remove '0b' prefix\n    print(f\"The binary representation of {decimal_num} is: {binary_num}\")\n\ndecimal_to_binary()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `bin()` function is used to convert the decimal number to binary. The `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary numbers.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to read a decimal number from the user.\n2. The `int()` function is used to convert the input to an integer.\n3. The `bin()` function is used to convert the decimal number to binary.\n4. The `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary number.\n5. The binary number is then printed out to the user.\n\nExample output:\n```\nEnter a decimal number: 12\nThe binary representation of 12 is: 1100\n```",
