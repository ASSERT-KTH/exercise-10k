  "answer": "**Sequence Generator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program generates a sequence of numbers based on user input. The user can choose from three different sequence types:\n\n1.  Arithmetic Sequence: A sequence in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.\n2.  Geometric Sequence: A sequence in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant.\n3.  Fibonacci Sequence: A sequence in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef arithmetic_sequence(a, d, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an arithmetic sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        d (int): The common difference.\n        n (int): The number of terms.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The generated arithmetic sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [a + i * d for i in range(n)]\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef geometric_sequence(a, r, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a geometric sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        r (int): The common ratio.\n        n (int): The number of terms.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The generated geometric sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [a * (r ** i) for i in range(n)]\n    return sequence\n\n\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The generated Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(sequence) < n:\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n    return sequence[:n]\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Sequence Generator Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------\")\n    print(\"1.
