  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a list of the frequency of each word in the string.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef word_frequencies(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input, splits it into words, \n    and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a word \n    and its frequency in the string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its frequency.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lower case\n    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', input_string).lower()\n\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = cleaned_string.split()\n\n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    frequency = Counter(words)\n\n    # Convert the frequency dictionary to a list of tuples\n    frequency_list = list(frequency.items())\n\n    return frequency_list\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_str = \"This is a test string. This string is just a test.\"\nprint(word_frequencies(input_str))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It removes punctuation from the input string and converts it to lower case to ensure that words are not counted as separate due to case differences.\n2. It splits the cleaned string into a list of words.\n3. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word.\n4. It converts the frequency dictionary to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency.\n5. It returns the list of word frequencies.\n\nWhen you run this program with the example input string, it will output a list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its frequency in the string. The output will look something like this:\n\n```python\n[('this', 2), ('is', 2), ('a', 2), ('test', 2), ('string', 2), ('just', 1)]\n```",
