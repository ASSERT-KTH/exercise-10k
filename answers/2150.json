  "prompt": "Write a program that reads a number from the user and prints out the number with two decimal places.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Read a number from the user\n    num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Print the number with two decimal places\n    print(f\"{num:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Get user input**: We use the built-in `input` function to read a string from the user. We then convert this string to a floating-point number using the `float` function.\n2. **Print with two decimal places**: We use an f-string to format the output. The `:.2f` format specifier tells Python to print the number as a floating-point number with two decimal places.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `3.14159`, the program will print `3.14`.\n* If the user enters `10`, the program will print `10.00`.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `print_decimal.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python print_decimal.py`). Then, follow the prompt to enter a number.",
