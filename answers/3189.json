  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that takes a day number as input and uses if/else statements to determine the corresponding day of the week:\n\n```python\ndef find_day(day_number):\n    if day_number == 1:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif day_number == 2:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif day_number == 3:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif day_number == 4:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    elif day_number == 5:\n        return \"Friday\"\n    elif day_number == 6:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n    elif day_number == 7:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\"\n\nday_number = int(input(\"Enter a day number (1-7): \"))\nprint(find_day(day_number))\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `find_day` function takes an integer `day_number` as input.\n2. The function uses a series of if/else statements to check the value of `day_number`.\n3. If `day_number` matches a specific value (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.), the function returns the corresponding day of the week.\n4. If `day_number` is not between 1 and 7, the function returns an error message.\n5. The program prompts the user to enter a day number using the `input` function.\n6. The program calls the `find_day` function with the user's input and prints the result.\n\nYou can also use a dictionary to map day numbers to days of the week, which can make the code more concise:\n\n```python\ndef find_day(day_number):\n    days = {\n        1: \"Monday\",\n        2: \"Tuesday\",\n        3: \"Wednesday\",\n        4: \"Thursday\",\n        5: \"Friday\",\n        6: \"Saturday\",\n        7: \"Sunday\"\n    }\n    return days.get(day_number, \"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\")\n\nday_number = int(input(\"Enter a day number (1-7): \"))\nprint(find_day(day_number))\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses a dictionary to map day numbers to days of the week. The `get` method is used to retrieve the day of the week for a given day number, and returns an error message if the day number is not in the dictionary.",
