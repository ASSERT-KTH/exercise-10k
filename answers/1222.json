The user can choose an operation by entering the corresponding number. The program will then ask for two numbers and perform the chosen operation. If the user chooses division, the program checks to ensure that the second number is not zero to prevent division by zero errors. The program continues to run and prompt the user for input until the user chooses to quit by entering '5'.",
