  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_sum = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum += num\n    return even_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = sum_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of even numbers:\", result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input, iterates over each number, and adds it to the sum if it is even (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). The function returns the sum of all even numbers. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample list of numbers.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a more concise version using list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = sum_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of even numbers:\", result)\n```\n\nThis version uses a generator expression to iterate over the numbers and sum up the even ones, all in one line.",
